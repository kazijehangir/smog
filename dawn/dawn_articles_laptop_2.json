Among the demands put forward is the representation of tribal people in the KP Assembly and convening of a meeting of the Council of Common Interests on the matter. The protesters are also seeking amendments to the Constitution to extend the jurisdiction of the superior courts to Fata.

He said the government is yet to announce a budget for Fata.If the government had implemented the reforms, this day would not have come, Chattan added.Jamiat Ulama-i-Islam-Sami (JUI-S) chief Maulana Samiul Haq said that \"some people in Islamabad do not believe that Fata is part of Pakistan.\"Earlier in the week, announcements were made in all the tribal agencies appealing for the people to go to Islamabad to make their demands known. Thousands of people from the tribal areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa are still expected to join the rally. People from Khyber, Bajaur, Mohmand and the Frontier Regions of Kohat and Peshawar are expected to come to the toll plaza to join the main rally.PTI Chairman Imran Khan had also directed his party workers, MNAs and MPAs to take part in the protest. During a press conference in Peshawar on Friday, Imran had demanded a Fata-KP merger before the 2018 general elections.Demands for the merger have been gaining momentum since Aug 2016, when a six-member committee headed by then advisor to the prime minister, Sartaj Aziz, had tabled a report before the cabinet that recommended major reforms, including the merger of the areas with KP.The report had generated controversy when two allies of the federal government \u2013 JUI-F and Pakhtunkhwa Milli Awami Party \u2013 opposed the committee report.\n", "author": "Dawn.com | Shakeel Qarar", "title": "Islamabad sees large rallies for early merger of Fata, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa"}}

Chancellor Angela Merkel's party and its sister party in Bavaria, the Christian Social Union, say they want to limit the annual number of migrants to 200,000. However, that number can be increased or lowered by parliament in reaction to any future refugee crises. The migrant issue had been one of the biggest stumbling blocks between the two parties as they head into coalition talks with the pro-business FDP and the Greens to form a new government following last month's national election. The face-saving compromise was much needed after Merkel and the CSU's leader, Horst Seehofer, wrangled over a migrant cap for almost two years. Merkel has repeatedly refused to agree to an annual cap for migrants, while the CSU had demanded a limit. While the CSU can now present an actual number to its party base, Merkel can point to the fact that the number is flexible and can be changed any time in reaction to incoming asylum seekers. Germany took in more than 1 million migrants between 2015 and 2016, but the numbers have drastically gone down since the Balkans route was blocked in early 2016. A migrants' deal with Turkey has also kept large numbers of people from crossing the Mediterranean to Europe's shores. The compromise also includes plans to build large centers where asylum-seekers must stay until their request has been processed. So far asylum-seekers are distributed across the country while awaiting the decision on their applications. It also seeks to add new immigration laws allowing for special migration of skilled workers. The migrant issue is likely to play a big role in upcoming coalition negotiations as the Greens have been vehemently opposed to eroding the right to asylum. Compared to many other European countries, Germany has more generous asylum laws. They are enshrined in the German constitution in reaction to the Third Reich, when many people fleeing the Nazis survived only because they were able to get asylum in other countries.\n", "author": "AP", "title": "German conservative parties say they agree on migrant limit"}}

I said 'NO' and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement),\" Trump wrote in a series of tweets.\"He also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said 'NO THANKS.' He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!\"Trump called Corker a \"negative voice\" who would \"stand in the way of our great agenda.\"\"Didn't have the guts to run!\" the president exclaimed.Corker for his part disputed the account, telling the Times that Trump had urged him to run again and promised to endorse him if he did.\"I don't know why the president tweets out things that are not true,\" he said.The generals and 'chaos'\nTrump's tweetstorm was not particularly unusual -- he has rarely been one to calmly endure criticism -- but Corker's blunt rebuttal was strikingly rare, coming from a fellow Republican in such a prominent position.The senator, perhaps feeling liberated by his decision not to seek re-election, tweeted: \"It's a shame the White House has become an adult day care center. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning,\" hinting that presidential caretakers were not doing their job.A few hours later, Trump was online once again -- hitting back to suggest Corker's achievements in office have been limited.\"Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!\" he wrote.The Trump-Corker feud, long in the making, flared up last week after Trump seemed to pull the rug out from Secretary of State Rex Tillerson as the Texan attempted to open lines of dialogue with North Korea.Trump tweeted that Tillerson was \"wasting his time trying to negotiate.\"A clearly frustrated Corker told reporters on Wednesday that Tillerson was not getting the support he needed from above.He then added: \"I think Secretary Tillerson, Secretary (of Defense James) Mattis and Chief of Staff (John) Kelly are those people that help separate our country from chaos, and I support them very much.\"While he did not mention Trump specifically, the comments seemed clearly aimed at the president.Corker had supported Trump's presidential campaign. He reportedly was considered as a possible vice presidential running mate to Trump, and later as a potential secretary of state.But the relationship took a turn for the worse in August. After Trump's much-criticised remarks about the violent protests in Charlottesville, Virginia, Corker said the president had \"not yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate.\"\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Top Republican lawmaker says US on course for WWIII with Trump at helm"}}

Average annualised return on all fresh deposits of all banks (excluding only those applicable on the interbank market) fell to 3.02 per cent in August this year from 3.30pc in the same month last year. Compare this return with the headline inflation of 3.4pc this August and you will find out that the deposit rate has already turned negative. This is, by no means, good for the economy. (Inflation in September shot up to 3.9pc and by all likelihood the wedge between the average fresh deposit rate of banks in September and the inflation number of that month will widen further). \nMoneyed people are resorting to a long-forgotten way of retaining value: buying dollars \nfrom the open market in anticipation of a looming rupee depreciation\nBank borrowers, particularly big ones, are getting cheap loans as the money market remains liquid despite banks\u2019 increased lending to the government. Certainly, this is good for the economy. Between July 1 and Sept 22 this year, banks\u2019 net lending to the private sector was minus Rs92 billion against that of Rs296bn in the same period of the last year. This indicates a decrease in gross lending amid increased credit retirement in the first quarter of the 2017-18 fiscal year compared to the same quarter of the preceding year. On the other hand, banks\u2019 lending to the federal government between July 1 and Sept 22 shot up to about Rs215bn against net retirement of government loans of Rs266bn in the year-ago period.Since political uncertainty is high ahead of general elections next year, the stock market is nervous and the index is shedding value, sending signals to people that it is better to sell more and buy less. Changes in rules and regulations governing the construction industry in Karachi has already left little chance for parking funds in the real estate \u2014 at least for some time.It is against this backdrop that moneyed people are resorting to a long-forgotten way of retaining value: buying dollars from the open market in anticipation of a looming rupee depreciation. On July 5, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) let the overvalued rupee find its real market worth. But the government intervened in an unprecedented way, compelling the central bank to restore the exchange rate. Since then, everything has been said and written for and against rupee depreciation.But now it\u2019s not about the perceived merits or demerits of depreciation. It\u2019s all about day-to-day functioning of the forex market that really matters. \u201cMetaphorically speaking, you cannot just stop a pregnant woman from giving birth if it is time for delivery, regardless of whether the arrival of the newborn is perceived to be good or bad for the extended family,\u201d commented the treasurer of a local bank. \u201cEither the rupee is overvalued or it is not. If it is overvalued, no amount of preaching about the merits and demerits of depreciation can stop a correction in the exchange rate. Delays can be harmful, like in case of a delayed childbirth,\u201d he siad.The recent rise in dollar buying from the open market can be seen as a signal that at least a segment of the forex market is anticipating exchange rate correction in the near future. A stronger indication could have been the conversion of rupee bank accounts into foreign currency accounts. But whether this is happening will be evident only after the central bank publishes its September report with details of FE 25 (foreign currency accounts). By August this year, the total amount placed in this account was $6.978 million, little changed from $6.963m in June. \u201cSo, we cannot see any sign right now that rupee accounts are being converted into FE 25 (in anticipation of rupee depreciation),\u201d said an SBP official. But given our weak key external account fundamentals and the fact that the rupee is still overvalued, markets continue to expect a change in exchange rate any time during this quarter.\u201cThe central bank was perhaps waiting for handling the March-June quarter external debt payments. Besides, the July 5 move of allowing the rupee to find its market worth had to be reversed on government intervention. So, I guess the central bank can now make more rapid adjustments in the dollar-rupee parity than it did till Sept 30,\u201d says a bank treasurer. The rupee has lost about half a per cent of its value against the dollar since July this year. Whether the local currency sheds value gradually, but still faster during this quarter than the past quarter, cannot be predicted. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi recently said in a Bloomberg interview that the rupee \u201cis not on the table\u201d. Meanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s forex reserves fell to $19.763bn on Sept 29 from about $21.402bn at end-June. This big fall of $1.639bn in just three months indicates that external-sector worries are far from over, despite the current account deficit in July-September, the balance of payments in July-August showed a surplus of $1.385bn against that of only $21m in July-August 2016-17.In the first two months of this fiscal year, the current account deficit also expanded to $2.601bn from $1.287bn in the year-ago period. Bankers are eagerly awaiting the first-quarter balance-of-payments data. \u201cIf the July-September current account deficit expands further and if balance of payment surplus shrinks, the exchange rate would certainly come under pressure and perhaps even the government would reconsider its position (on any move by the central bank to depreciate the rupee),\u201d says a source close to the SBP.Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Mohiuddin Aazim", "title": "Market seesaws amid currency drama"}}

The rustic, yet polished interior is inspired by many of the Spanish artist\u2019s works with small picture frames and mirrors on one side, and large hand-painted empty gold frames adorning the opposite. There are cracks in the wall, hanging light bulbs provide a surreal effect in the evening and beautiful miniatures of giraffes created with twisted gold and black copper wire stand among other decoration pieces on a table placed by the entrance. The theme reflects Dali\u2019s surrealism interspersed with the interior designer\u2019s personal touch of optical illusion. This is The Burning Giraffe. A new addition to the ever-growing list of high-end restaurants in town, replacing what stood earlier in its place, Caf\u00e9 Latch -- located in the Fashion Avenue off Gulberg\u2019s Main Boulevard in a cramped street surrounded by many a restaurant and caf\u00e9. The menu is a limited, yet eclectic mix of crowd favourites and some signatures, catering to the fitness conscious as well as those who least care \u2013 like me. From the starters, I tried bits of the cheese wedges, calamari, beef tataki and sliders. The TBG Fried Calamari, served hot, must be devoured immediately before it becomes chewy. It\u2019s a deliciously crunchy, tangy calamari drizzled with an in-house sauce and sprinkled with some fresh veggie salad. Will definitely make you want more. The Fried Mozzarella Wedges, as the name suggests, are palm-sized triangles of thick mozzarella cheese fried in a batter and served with three dips. Cheese lovers will savour this one. Every time I think about the Beef Tataki, I start salivating. It was delectable. Ultra thin strips of tender, barely cooked beef, raw in the centre, drizzled with a mouthwatering tangy, citrusy in-house ponzu sauce and garnished with rocket leaves, julienned spring onions, crispy garlic chips, toasted sesame and Thai red chilli flakes. The most amazing start to a meal. I also tried the Flamin\u2019 Cheeto chicken slider, but not being a burger fan it won\u2019t be fair to comment on it. It sure was unique in that the chicken is coated with Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos crisps. From the mains, I first tried the Truffled Mac and Cheese. Truly a fulfilling, comfort meal, this was a dish of baked creamy elbow macaroni with lots of cheddar and mozzarella cheese and fresh mushrooms. The earthiness of white truffle oil adds a unique flavour to and elevates a basic plate of Mac and Cheese. Definitely one of my favourites here. Next I tried the Beef Donburi Bowl. It\u2019s a Japanese-inspired dish that comprised sticky garlic rice at the bottom of a bowl with a fried egg, juicy chunks of beef and fresh vegetables sitting on top, garnished with red chili flakes and roasted sesame seeds. Another bowl of yummy comfort food, though the quantity is such that it was finished just when I started enjoying it. A few other items worth mentioning are the Butter Milk Fried Chicken Sandwich (actually a burger) that will remind you of KFC\u2019s heyday \u2013 a high-end version of it though. Also, the YAN Special Beef Burger with a thick, tender beef patty drizzled with a generous amount of chef\u2019s special sauce. The Crispy Chicken Salad was a disappointment though the chunks of chicken were crispy and iceberg lettuce fresh. But that\u2019s it. TBG is still in the process of finalising its desserts with barely a couple of weeks into the launch. What you will find there, however, is their specialty, the indulgent Cookie Skillet that is easily enough for at least a couple of people. It\u2019s a giant gooey chocolate and Nutella cookie baked inside a skillet and topped with a chocolate sauce with two scoops of vanilla ice cream sitting on top. There\u2019s also carrot cake and brownie with ice cream. The Green Apple Chiller is delicious and refreshing when the weather isn\u2019t on your side. The space is quite limited, which allows the three business partners to attend to guests, but at the same time is a big negative \u2013 for me, at least. When packed, it gets annoyingly noisy. If that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s loud music playing in the background. And being a high-end restaurant, it can leave you with a gaping hole in the pocket \u2013 starters ranging between Rs550 and Rs1,550, and a small bowl of salad for Rs650 are just some examples.

Since the IMF programme came to an end, external indicators of the economy have deteriorated, says \u2018The South Asia Economic Focus Fall 2017\u2019 released on Sunday ahead of the World Bank and IMF annual meetings.One year ago, Pakistan was in a comfortable position, as international reserves were large enough to cover the current account deficit, the service of external debt and even the total volume of portfolio investments in the country. By now international reserves still cover the first two items, but not the third one. Addressing the sources of this increased vulnerability should be a priority, suggests the report.In Pakistan, macroeconomic discipline arguably weakened after the IMF programme came to an end. In recent years, there had been clear progress in restoring macroeconomic stability and laying some of the foundations for higher growth.\nReport says weaker discipline leads to vulnerabilities in balance of payments\nPakistan also regained emerging market status in the MSCI index and made progress on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC); two developments that reinforced general optimism. However, macroeconomic discipline has deteriorated in recent months.The report says that improving the external balance hinges upon a revival in exports, a slowdown in imports, and stable remittance flows. In the absence of any of these factors, the persistent current account deficit will put further pressure on already dwindling reserves.The fiscal position is also expected to deteriorate during the election cycle, which would affect debt trends and maintain debt at the current high level, cautions the report titled \u201cGrowth out of the Blue\u201d.The report says that the ouster of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has enhanced political risks and created some policy uncertainty. The upcoming national election in 2018 may affect the reform momentum and macroeconomic policy. Slower progress in much-needed structural reforms would weaken growth prospects and discourage private investment.The outlook until fiscal year 2019 is for moderately higher growth, and this outlook is contingent upon continued macro-economic and political stability, as well as steady progress in implementing the main pillars of the government\u2019s medium-term reform programme, which tackles key constraints to growth. The outlook assumes that oil prices will increase moderately but remain low.On the supply side, impetus to growth is projected to come from the services and the industrial sectors, while on the demand side, acceleration would be driven by public and private consumption, aided by a moderate increase in investment.The pressure on the current account is expected to persist as the trade deficit will remain elevated during 2018 and 2019. This situation can potentially become unsustainable in absence of corrective policy measures. However, exports are expected to recover during fiscal years 2018 and 2019 due to an easing of supply side factors.Imports, after strong growth of 17.7 per cent in fiscal year 2017, are expected to grow at a slower pace in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Remittances will continue to partly finance the current account deficit.It is also expected that FDI flows will strengthen due to accelerated implementation of CPEC projects. However, capital and financial flows during fiscal years 2018 and 2019 will only partly finance the current account deficit, which will result in a drawdown of reserves during these two years.The report says that fiscal slippages are expected to continue through the election cycle, which will result in a widening of the fiscal deficit during fiscal year 2018. This increase in the fiscal deficit is primarily driven by a slower increase in tax revenues, both federal and provincial, and a sharper increase in expenditures.An adjustment in the fiscal position in fiscal year 2019 after the election will help in curtailing the fiscal deficit. Inflation, after remaining moderate during fiscal year 2017, is expected to rise in 2018 and 2019.

{"1362592": {"date": "Updated October 09, 2017", "article": "The government has decided to impose five per cent to 25pc regulatory duty on about 250 non-essential imports as a way around the recent build-up of expectations of, and growing demands for, currency devaluation and to push back a looming currency crisis. Simultaneously, the government also took a decision to hand out a few more concessions to exporters under the Rs180 billion package given in January this year and spread over a period of 18 months to June 2018. By making imported old cars, fruit, handsets, garments, electronic goods, etc more expensive and encouraging exports, the government hopes to tackle the growing trade deficit that spiked to a record $33bn last fiscal year and stem the drawdown on the country\u2019s fast-declining dollar reserves. But will it be able to do so?\nBy making imports more expensive and encouraging exports, the government hopes to tackle the growing trade deficit and stem the drawdown on the country\u2019s fast-declining dollar reserves. But will it be able to do so?\n\u201cIt is not the first time policymakers have tried to restrict luxury imports by making them more expensive and harder to bring in. Earlier in March, traders were asked to pay 100pc cash to cover their imports of what the government describes as non-essential items. The move didn\u2019t yield the intended results, though. Instead, it encouraged smuggling and under-invoicing,\u201d a leading trader from Lahore said on condition of anonymity. \u201cIf the demand for something exists, it will eventually find its way to the market. Higher prices affect demand but only marginally. The markets and buyers always adjust to the changing realities quite quickly no matter what,\u201d he chuckled.The use of tariff barriers to discourage imports is being seen as a desperate attempt by the government to quash growing expectations of devaluation that have been building up for quite some time because of pressure on the country\u2019s external sector. Political uncertainty in the aftermath of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s disqualification by the apex court seems to have exacerbated the situation, with the government appearing to have lost its handle on the economy in an election-year, and with macroeconomic fundamentals slipping with the passage of time.The central bank\u2019s official dollar reserves dropped to $13.8bn on Sept 29 from $18.9bn a year ago. Trade deficit has also soared to a record high mainly on the back of import of machinery and equipment for energy and transport projects under the $57bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor initiative. The current account deficit, which spiked to more than four per cent of the size of the economy to $12.1bn during the last financial year, has surged to $2.6bn in the first two months of the current fiscal to August.\u201cIt is quite natural for the markets to build up expectations of rupee depreciation as the State Bank is running out of its foreign currency stocks with imports surging, and exports and workers\u2019 remittances declining \u2014 or flattening at best,\u201d argued a Lahore-based financial analyst. \u201cThe government needs dollars to pay its bills, service its debt, shore up its reserves, restore confidence in the currency and quell expectations of a new round of currency devaluation,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, it doesn\u2019t matter if we have to borrow more money to boost our foreign currency reserves in order to defend our financial stability, if the government wants to ward off rupee devaluation in the near election-year.\u201dA number of businessmen, and economic and financial analysts Dawn spoke to favoured a downward adjustment of the exchange rate to hold off a balance-of-payments crisis. \u201cOur currency is overvalued and hurting our exports. Adjusting the exchange rate should boost our exports, help capital formation and bridge the widening current account gap in the long run,\u201d a textile exporter contended.Yet, not everyone advocating devaluation supports the demand for a weaker rupee unconditionally. \u201cIt will be naive to expect devaluation of the rupee to take care of our current account woes. If the rupee value has to be adjusted it must be done as part of a combination of policy measures to narrow down the trade deficit through restrictions on imports and incentives for exports, as well as checks to stop smuggling and under-invoicing,\u201d a head of research at a brokerage in Karachi insisted.Another economic analyst, also from Karachi, questioned the demand for a weaker currency for boosting exports and eventually covering the current account hole. \u201cThe currency depreciation doesn\u2019t guarantee automatic increase in exports. In fact, you have got to have a stable currency to attract investment and grow exports as Bangladesh has done over the years. Devaluation will only fuel inflation and impoverish our people. \u201cThe long-term solution to our balance-of-payments issue lies in offering incentives to our exports through tax reforms and reduction in energy prices in order to help them become competitive, curb non-essential imports without being over-protectionist, and attract investment in the manufacturing industry to produce surplus for exports and substitute imports,\u201d he said.Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Nasir Jamal", "title": "Firefighting to shore up reserves"}}

As the storm moved northeast into Alabama, Nate\u2019s maximum sustained winds dropped to 35 miles per hour (55km per hour), prompting the National Hurricane Centre to end its tropical storm warnings for the region. The storm made landfall as a Category 1 hurricane, the weakest designation by the centre.

The fourth major storm to strike the United States in less than two months, Nate killed at least 30 people in Central America before entering the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico and bearing down on the US South. It has also shut down most oil and gas production in the Gulf. Nate follows hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria, which have devastated areas of the Caribbean and southern United States.

{"1362572": {"date": "Updated October 09, 2017", "article": "IN many ways 2017 has been a reasonably stable year for the Washington, DC, area\u2019s business community. The surging job growth of 2016 hasn\u2019t let up. The prospect of a jump in defence spending has sparked a stock market rally for government services firms, many of which are based here. And the region has had incremental success persuading large corporations to relocate here, with Nestl\u00e9 and Yelp opening major offices.But all that business success has yet to translate into big salary increases for the average worker in the region.Payroll data collected by the research group Akron and the D.C. chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management found that local companies increased average salary budgets by about 3 per cent between 2016 and 2017. Companies say they expect to do the same next year.That\u2019s about the same increase that companies offered in the years immediately after the recession. Raises tend to be much smaller than they were before the 2009, when average salary budgets in the area went up by about 4pc every year.The slow pace of payroll growth has continued to puzzle economists, who say plunging unemployment rates, surging stocks, a shrinking labour force and stable federal spending should be prompting employers to allocate more to payroll.\u201cEvery construction firm owner you talk to says, \u2018We can\u2019t find pipe fitters, we can\u2019t find welders,\u2019\u201d said Anirban Basu, an economist with Sage Policy Group. \u201cEverybody is screaming about worker shortages but when you look at the data, wages aren\u2019t really accelerating.\u201dSo why haven\u2019t salaries risen faster?Akron survey administrator Angelo Kostopoulos describes a corporate environment where companies are \u201cstill trying to do more with less.\u201d The memory of the last economic downturn is still fresh in the minds of many managers, and it\u2019s leading them to be cautious about how they handle raises and bonuses. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it stayed like this for several years to come,\u201d Kostopoulos said.Some say low inflation also gives managers leeway to keep salary increases small. The inflation rate for the United States was about 1.7pc for the one-year period that ended July, less than the average payroll increase.But even with inflation in check, the cost of living in the Washington area has increased significantly for some.Rents have skyrocketed, making it hard for newer residents to settle in for the long term, and housing costs have priced some D.C. natives out of once-affordable neighbourhoods.Others chalk the stagnant salaries up to changing demographics. Any gains that younger workers are getting are masked by the fact that baby boomers are starting to retire.Those baby boomers are often the most experienced, skilled and highly compensated people in an organisation. When they retire, they are often replaced by younger people who earn less.There are some corners of the local economy where pay increases are speeding up. There was a 9.7pc jump in median salary for marketing and sales professionals, possibly reflecting companies\u2019 efforts to expand after years of hunkering down. There was a 9.1pc median salary jump for legal professionals and a 6.2pc jump for IT workers, job categories that have historically paid well.Then there are the jobs where good pay is not just tied to a skill. Employees who have security clearances, a sought-after commodity in Washing\u00adton\u2019s contracting community, have received larger pay increases than people doing comparable work without a clearance.Among a sample of government contractors surveyed by Akron, 48pc said they offered higher pay for cleared employees, up from 43pc last year.\u201cThis is a clear reflection of the challenge of all companies in getting new people cleared,\u201d said Alan Chvotkin, general counsel at the Professional Services Council, which lobbies on behalf of government contractors.Cleared employees, many of them former military veterans, typically made between 5 and 15pc more than their non-cleared counterparts. Senior research analysts and high-level administrators earned 50 to 60pc more when they had clearances. Even receptionists can expect a 15pc bump in pay by virtue of holding an active clearance, the survey found.\u2014 Bloomberg/The Washington Post ServicePublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Aaron Gregg", "title": "Nine years since the recession, why are employers still stingy with raises?"}}

Its success came at the expense of the mainstream parties, making it harder for Merkel to form a working majority.Her best shot now \u2014 if she wants to avoid fresh elections that could further boost the AfD \u2014 is an alliance with two other parties that make for odd bedfellows, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the left-leaning Greens.Such a power pact \u2014 dubbed a \u201cJamaica coalition\u201d because the three party colours match those of the Caribbean nation\u2019s flag \u2014 would be a first at the national level in Germany.In the talks to come, likely to take weeks, all players will fight for ministerial posts and issues from EU relations to climate policy. All must give a little to reach a compromise \u2014 but not too much, to avoid charges from their own party bases that they are selling out in a grab for power.The smaller parties will seek to avoid the fate of Merkel\u2019s previous junior coalition partners: both the FDP and SPD have suffered stunning losses after governing in the veteran chancellor\u2019s shadow.Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Refugee issue complicates Merkel\u2019s bid to form govt"}}

A fearful situation was created when reports came in from Khairpur about the alleged kidnapping attempt of a Turkish family man, said to be working with the same organisation.

However, renowned theatre and TV actor Khalid Ahmed and legendary ghazal singer Tina Sani had a different perspective that they shared with the audience at The Second Floor on Saturday night. While Khalid Ahmed shared his experience as a vocal trainer for actors and association with arts, Tina told the packed audience about her 40 years in music industry and her association with the best in the business.Mr Ahmed was the first to speak and he lamented that the current generation uses music as a shortcut to fame; instead of observing ustaads and learning from them, many students at the National Academy of Performing Arts first get makeovers to look like musicians and later on quit studies after understanding the basics. He also accused the patrons of not supporting musicians in Pakistan, which resulted in the decline of classical music in the country; something that still gets patronage from the government and the well-wishers in India. In his opinion, multinational brands should lend their support to the families of classical musicians because (a) even after 70 years, they are still not considered equal and (b) because the ustaads don\u2019t want their children to pursue music for monetary reasons. For them, their head waiter son gets more respect than they ever did and that is a shameful situation for us as a nation.Tina Sani, on the other hand, had a different perspective; the renowned singer disclosed to the audience that when she was growing up, she didn\u2019t know who Begum Akhtar was and that was because she belonged to her father\u2019s generation, not hers. However, with the passage of time, she managed to understand the basics of music and after becoming a ghazal singer learnt a lot from Mehdi Hasan and Tufail Niazi who were masters of the trade. She told the audience that most musicians were affected by Partition, as they had to start over in the new country. She cited the example of Tufail Niazi, who was a star in the Indian Punjab before Partition, so much, so that people first used to get dates from him and then set the date for their functions, most notably weddings. In the Sikh dominated area, people used to tease one another with Oh To Kera Tufail Ko Le Aana when people used to delay dates. When he migrated to Pakistan with his family, he opened a dairy shop in Multan because not many knew him in this part of Punjab. One police officer recognised him and helped him out with the instruments that migrating musicians had left behind, reviving his career in Pakistan. Others, however, weren\u2019t that successful, according to Tina, and when PTV allotted 4pm slot to classical music, it sort of pushed them further down the road.Tina Sani also told the audience that voice training has nothing to do with singing; she also rejected the notion of practising for more than 12 hours because, in the West, artists develop techniques to better their vocals, something we don\u2019t believe in. She compared American tennis stars Arthur Ashe and Serena Williams, saying that a lot has changed from the time when Arthur Ashe used to play just because now, Serena Williams knows how to play smartly, with better gadgets, improved techniques in less time. Tina also termed folk music Pakistan\u2019s very own since all musicians and singers who pursue folk are treated stars in their villages and are looked after by the rich. She also advised the youngsters willing to take music as a career to follow the master, not the leader since the leader will give them a refresher course, a master will send them out to venture and learn. After a brief question and answer session, the event concluded with Tina Sani singing Bol Kay Lab Azad Hain Tere that captivated the audience.Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Omair Alavi", "title": "The rise and fall of Pakistani music"}}

However, that number can be increased or lowered by parliament in reaction to any future refugee crises. The migrant issue had been one of the biggest stumbling blocks between the two parties as they head into coalition talks with the pro-business FDP and the Greens to form a new government following last month's national election. The face-saving compromise was much needed after Merkel and the CSU's leader, Horst Seehofer, wrangled over a migrant cap for almost two years. Merkel has repeatedly refused to agree to an annual cap for migrants, while the CSU had demanded a limit. While the CSU can now present an actual number to its party base, Merkel can point to the fact that the number is flexible and can be changed any time in reaction to incoming asylum seekers. Germany took in more than 1 million migrants between 2015 and 2016, but the numbers have drastically gone down since the Balkans route was blocked in early 2016. A migrants' deal with Turkey has also kept large numbers of people from crossing the Mediterranean to Europe's shores. The compromise also includes plans to build large centers where asylum-seekers must stay until their request has been processed. So far asylum-seekers are distributed across the country while awaiting the decision on their applications. It also seeks to add new immigration laws allowing for special migration of skilled workers.

{"1362672": {"date": "Updated October 09, 2017", "article": "\n\n\n\nDepositors continue to suffer as banks maintain low deposit rates in an extended stable monetary policy regime while rising inflation continues to erode the net deposit rate further. Average annualised return on all fresh deposits of all banks (excluding only those applicable on the interbank market) fell to 3.02 per cent in August this year from 3.30pc in the same month last year. Compare this return with the headline inflation of 3.4pc this August and you will find out that the deposit rate has already turned negative. This is, by no means, good for the economy. (Inflation in September shot up to 3.9pc and by all likelihood the wedge between the average fresh deposit rate of banks in September and the inflation number of that month will widen further). \nMoneyed people are resorting to a long-forgotten way of retaining value: buying dollars \nfrom the open market in anticipation of a looming rupee depreciation\nBank borrowers, particularly big ones, are getting cheap loans as the money market remains liquid despite banks\u2019 increased lending to the government. Certainly, this is good for the economy. Between July 1 and Sept 22 this year, banks\u2019 net lending to the private sector was minus Rs92 billion against that of Rs296bn in the same period of the last year. This indicates a decrease in gross lending amid increased credit retirement in the first quarter of the 2017-18 fiscal year compared to the same quarter of the preceding year. On the other hand, banks\u2019 lending to the federal government between July 1 and Sept 22 shot up to about Rs215bn against net retirement of government loans of Rs266bn in the year-ago period.Since political uncertainty is high ahead of general elections next year, the stock market is nervous and the index is shedding value, sending signals to people that it is better to sell more and buy less. Changes in rules and regulations governing the construction industry in Karachi has already left little chance for parking funds in the real estate \u2014 at least for some time.It is against this backdrop that moneyed people are resorting to a long-forgotten way of retaining value: buying dollars from the open market in anticipation of a looming rupee depreciation. On July 5, the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) let the overvalued rupee find its real market worth. But the government intervened in an unprecedented way, compelling the central bank to restore the exchange rate. Since then, everything has been said and written for and against rupee depreciation.But now it\u2019s not about the perceived merits or demerits of depreciation. It\u2019s all about day-to-day functioning of the forex market that really matters. \u201cMetaphorically speaking, you cannot just stop a pregnant woman from giving birth if it is time for delivery, regardless of whether the arrival of the newborn is perceived to be good or bad for the extended family,\u201d commented the treasurer of a local bank. \u201cEither the rupee is overvalued or it is not. If it is overvalued, no amount of preaching about the merits and demerits of depreciation can stop a correction in the exchange rate. Delays can be harmful, like in case of a delayed childbirth,\u201d he siad.The recent rise in dollar buying from the open market can be seen as a signal that at least a segment of the forex market is anticipating exchange rate correction in the near future. A stronger indication could have been the conversion of rupee bank accounts into foreign currency accounts. But whether this is happening will be evident only after the central bank publishes its September report with details of FE 25 (foreign currency accounts). By August this year, the total amount placed in this account was $6.978 million, little changed from $6.963m in June. \u201cSo, we cannot see any sign right now that rupee accounts are being converted into FE 25 (in anticipation of rupee depreciation),\u201d said an SBP official. But given our weak key external account fundamentals and the fact that the rupee is still overvalued, markets continue to expect a change in exchange rate any time during this quarter.\u201cThe central bank was perhaps waiting for handling the March-June quarter external debt payments. Besides, the July 5 move of allowing the rupee to find its market worth had to be reversed on government intervention. So, I guess the central bank can now make more rapid adjustments in the dollar-rupee parity than it did till Sept 30,\u201d says a bank treasurer. The rupee has lost about half a per cent of its value against the dollar since July this year. Whether the local currency sheds value gradually, but still faster during this quarter than the past quarter, cannot be predicted. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi recently said in a Bloomberg interview that the rupee \u201cis not on the table\u201d. Meanwhile, Pakistan\u2019s forex reserves fell to $19.763bn on Sept 29 from about $21.402bn at end-June. This big fall of $1.639bn in just three months indicates that external-sector worries are far from over, despite the current account deficit in July-September, the balance of payments in July-August showed a surplus of $1.385bn against that of only $21m in July-August 2016-17.In the first two months of this fiscal year, the current account deficit also expanded to $2.601bn from $1.287bn in the year-ago period. Bankers are eagerly awaiting the first-quarter balance-of-payments data. \u201cIf the July-September current account deficit expands further and if balance of payment surplus shrinks, the exchange rate would certainly come under pressure and perhaps even the government would reconsider its position (on any move by the central bank to depreciate the rupee),\u201d says a source close to the SBP.Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Mohiuddin Aazim", "title": "Market seesaws amid currency drama"}}

The rustic, yet polished interior is inspired by many of the Spanish artist\u2019s works with small picture frames and mirrors on one side, and large hand-painted empty gold frames adorning the opposite. There are cracks in the wall, hanging light bulbs provide a surreal effect in the evening and beautiful miniatures of giraffes created with twisted gold and black copper wire stand among other decoration pieces on a table placed by the entrance. The theme reflects Dali\u2019s surrealism interspersed with the interior designer\u2019s personal touch of optical illusion. This is The Burning Giraffe. A new addition to the ever-growing list of high-end restaurants in town, replacing what stood earlier in its place, Caf\u00e9 Latch -- located in the Fashion Avenue off Gulberg\u2019s Main Boulevard in a cramped street surrounded by many a restaurant and caf\u00e9. The menu is a limited, yet eclectic mix of crowd favourites and some signatures, catering to the fitness conscious as well as those who least care \u2013 like me. From the starters, I tried bits of the cheese wedges, calamari, beef tataki and sliders. The TBG Fried Calamari, served hot, must be devoured immediately before it becomes chewy. It\u2019s a deliciously crunchy, tangy calamari drizzled with an in-house sauce and sprinkled with some fresh veggie salad. Will definitely make you want more. The Fried Mozzarella Wedges, as the name suggests, are palm-sized triangles of thick mozzarella cheese fried in a batter and served with three dips. Cheese lovers will savour this one. Every time I think about the Beef Tataki, I start salivating. It was delectable. Ultra thin strips of tender, barely cooked beef, raw in the centre, drizzled with a mouthwatering tangy, citrusy in-house ponzu sauce and garnished with rocket leaves, julienned spring onions, crispy garlic chips, toasted sesame and Thai red chilli flakes. The most amazing start to a meal. I also tried the Flamin\u2019 Cheeto chicken slider, but not being a burger fan it won\u2019t be fair to comment on it. It sure was unique in that the chicken is coated with Flamin\u2019 Hot Cheetos crisps. From the mains, I first tried the Truffled Mac and Cheese. Truly a fulfilling, comfort meal, this was a dish of baked creamy elbow macaroni with lots of cheddar and mozzarella cheese and fresh mushrooms. The earthiness of white truffle oil adds a unique flavour to and elevates a basic plate of Mac and Cheese. Definitely one of my favourites here. Next I tried the Beef Donburi Bowl. It\u2019s a Japanese-inspired dish that comprised sticky garlic rice at the bottom of a bowl with a fried egg, juicy chunks of beef and fresh vegetables sitting on top, garnished with red chili flakes and roasted sesame seeds. Another bowl of yummy comfort food, though the quantity is such that it was finished just when I started enjoying it. A few other items worth mentioning are the Butter Milk Fried Chicken Sandwich (actually a burger) that will remind you of KFC\u2019s heyday \u2013 a high-end version of it though. Also, the YAN Special Beef Burger with a thick, tender beef patty drizzled with a generous amount of chef\u2019s special sauce. The Crispy Chicken Salad was a disappointment though the chunks of chicken were crispy and iceberg lettuce fresh. But that\u2019s it. TBG is still in the process of finalising its desserts with barely a couple of weeks into the launch. What you will find there, however, is their specialty, the indulgent Cookie Skillet that is easily enough for at least a couple of people. It\u2019s a giant gooey chocolate and Nutella cookie baked inside a skillet and topped with a chocolate sauce with two scoops of vanilla ice cream sitting on top. There\u2019s also carrot cake and brownie with ice cream. The Green Apple Chiller is delicious and refreshing when the weather isn\u2019t on your side. The space is quite limited, which allows the three business partners to attend to guests, but at the same time is a big negative \u2013 for me, at least. When packed, it gets annoyingly noisy. If that\u2019s not enough, there\u2019s loud music playing in the background. And being a high-end restaurant, it can leave you with a gaping hole in the pocket \u2013 starters ranging between Rs550 and Rs1,550, and a small bowl of salad for Rs650 are just some examples.

{"1362612": {"date": "Updated October 09, 2017", "article": "ISLAMABAD: The World Bank has warned that macroeconomic risks in Pakistan have increased substantially during the fiscal year 2017, as the external balance is particularly vulnerable given the persistent current account deficit, affecting the country\u2019s reserve position.Pakistan\u2019s weaker macroeconomic discipline has led to vulnerabilities in the balance of payments. Since the IMF programme came to an end, external indicators of the economy have deteriorated, says \u2018The South Asia Economic Focus Fall 2017\u2019 released on Sunday ahead of the World Bank and IMF annual meetings.One year ago, Pakistan was in a comfortable position, as international reserves were large enough to cover the current account deficit, the service of external debt and even the total volume of portfolio investments in the country. By now international reserves still cover the first two items, but not the third one. Addressing the sources of this increased vulnerability should be a priority, suggests the report.In Pakistan, macroeconomic discipline arguably weakened after the IMF programme came to an end. In recent years, there had been clear progress in restoring macroeconomic stability and laying some of the foundations for higher growth.\nReport says weaker discipline leads to vulnerabilities in balance of payments\nPakistan also regained emerging market status in the MSCI index and made progress on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC); two developments that reinforced general optimism. However, macroeconomic discipline has deteriorated in recent months.The report says that improving the external balance hinges upon a revival in exports, a slowdown in imports, and stable remittance flows. In the absence of any of these factors, the persistent current account deficit will put further pressure on already dwindling reserves.The fiscal position is also expected to deteriorate during the election cycle, which would affect debt trends and maintain debt at the current high level, cautions the report titled \u201cGrowth out of the Blue\u201d.The report says that the ouster of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif has enhanced political risks and created some policy uncertainty. The upcoming national election in 2018 may affect the reform momentum and macroeconomic policy. Slower progress in much-needed structural reforms would weaken growth prospects and discourage private investment.The outlook until fiscal year 2019 is for moderately higher growth, and this outlook is contingent upon continued macro-economic and political stability, as well as steady progress in implementing the main pillars of the government\u2019s medium-term reform programme, which tackles key constraints to growth. The outlook assumes that oil prices will increase moderately but remain low.On the supply side, impetus to growth is projected to come from the services and the industrial sectors, while on the demand side, acceleration would be driven by public and private consumption, aided by a moderate increase in investment.The pressure on the current account is expected to persist as the trade deficit will remain elevated during 2018 and 2019. This situation can potentially become unsustainable in absence of corrective policy measures. However, exports are expected to recover during fiscal years 2018 and 2019 due to an easing of supply side factors.Imports, after strong growth of 17.7 per cent in fiscal year 2017, are expected to grow at a slower pace in fiscal years 2018 and 2019. Remittances will continue to partly finance the current account deficit.It is also expected that FDI flows will strengthen due to accelerated implementation of CPEC projects. However, capital and financial flows during fiscal years 2018 and 2019 will only partly finance the current account deficit, which will result in a drawdown of reserves during these two years.The report says that fiscal slippages are expected to continue through the election cycle, which will result in a widening of the fiscal deficit during fiscal year 2018. This increase in the fiscal deficit is primarily driven by a slower increase in tax revenues, both federal and provincial, and a sharper increase in expenditures.An adjustment in the fiscal position in fiscal year 2019 after the election will help in curtailing the fiscal deficit. Inflation, after remaining moderate during fiscal year 2017, is expected to rise in 2018 and 2019.

Simultaneously, the government also took a decision to hand out a few more concessions to exporters under the Rs180 billion package given in January this year and spread over a period of 18 months to June 2018. By making imported old cars, fruit, handsets, garments, electronic goods, etc more expensive and encouraging exports, the government hopes to tackle the growing trade deficit that spiked to a record $33bn last fiscal year and stem the drawdown on the country\u2019s fast-declining dollar reserves. But will it be able to do so?\nBy making imports more expensive and encouraging exports, the government hopes to tackle the growing trade deficit and stem the drawdown on the country\u2019s fast-declining dollar reserves. But will it be able to do so?\n\u201cIt is not the first time policymakers have tried to restrict luxury imports by making them more expensive and harder to bring in. Earlier in March, traders were asked to pay 100pc cash to cover their imports of what the government describes as non-essential items. The move didn\u2019t yield the intended results, though. Instead, it encouraged smuggling and under-invoicing,\u201d a leading trader from Lahore said on condition of anonymity. \u201cIf the demand for something exists, it will eventually find its way to the market. Higher prices affect demand but only marginally. The markets and buyers always adjust to the changing realities quite quickly no matter what,\u201d he chuckled.The use of tariff barriers to discourage imports is being seen as a desperate attempt by the government to quash growing expectations of devaluation that have been building up for quite some time because of pressure on the country\u2019s external sector. Political uncertainty in the aftermath of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s disqualification by the apex court seems to have exacerbated the situation, with the government appearing to have lost its handle on the economy in an election-year, and with macroeconomic fundamentals slipping with the passage of time.The central bank\u2019s official dollar reserves dropped to $13.8bn on Sept 29 from $18.9bn a year ago. Trade deficit has also soared to a record high mainly on the back of import of machinery and equipment for energy and transport projects under the $57bn China-Pakistan Economic Corridor initiative. The current account deficit, which spiked to more than four per cent of the size of the economy to $12.1bn during the last financial year, has surged to $2.6bn in the first two months of the current fiscal to August.\u201cIt is quite natural for the markets to build up expectations of rupee depreciation as the State Bank is running out of its foreign currency stocks with imports surging, and exports and workers\u2019 remittances declining \u2014 or flattening at best,\u201d argued a Lahore-based financial analyst. \u201cThe government needs dollars to pay its bills, service its debt, shore up its reserves, restore confidence in the currency and quell expectations of a new round of currency devaluation,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the moment, it doesn\u2019t matter if we have to borrow more money to boost our foreign currency reserves in order to defend our financial stability, if the government wants to ward off rupee devaluation in the near election-year.\u201dA number of businessmen, and economic and financial analysts Dawn spoke to favoured a downward adjustment of the exchange rate to hold off a balance-of-payments crisis. \u201cOur currency is overvalued and hurting our exports. Adjusting the exchange rate should boost our exports, help capital formation and bridge the widening current account gap in the long run,\u201d a textile exporter contended.Yet, not everyone advocating devaluation supports the demand for a weaker rupee unconditionally. \u201cIt will be naive to expect devaluation of the rupee to take care of our current account woes. If the rupee value has to be adjusted it must be done as part of a combination of policy measures to narrow down the trade deficit through restrictions on imports and incentives for exports, as well as checks to stop smuggling and under-invoicing,\u201d a head of research at a brokerage in Karachi insisted.Another economic analyst, also from Karachi, questioned the demand for a weaker currency for boosting exports and eventually covering the current account hole. \u201cThe currency depreciation doesn\u2019t guarantee automatic increase in exports. In fact, you have got to have a stable currency to attract investment and grow exports as Bangladesh has done over the years. Devaluation will only fuel inflation and impoverish our people. \u201cThe long-term solution to our balance-of-payments issue lies in offering incentives to our exports through tax reforms and reduction in energy prices in order to help them become competitive, curb non-essential imports without being over-protectionist, and attract investment in the manufacturing industry to produce surplus for exports and substitute imports,\u201d he said.Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Nasir Jamal", "title": "Firefighting to shore up reserves"}}

{"1362572": {"date": "Updated October 09, 2017", "article": "IN many ways 2017 has been a reasonably stable year for the Washington, DC, area\u2019s business community. The surging job growth of 2016 hasn\u2019t let up. The prospect of a jump in defence spending has sparked a stock market rally for government services firms, many of which are based here. And the region has had incremental success persuading large corporations to relocate here, with Nestl\u00e9 and Yelp opening major offices.But all that business success has yet to translate into big salary increases for the average worker in the region.Payroll data collected by the research group Akron and the D.C. chapter of the Society for Human Resource Management found that local companies increased average salary budgets by about 3 per cent between 2016 and 2017. Companies say they expect to do the same next year.That\u2019s about the same increase that companies offered in the years immediately after the recession. Raises tend to be much smaller than they were before the 2009, when average salary budgets in the area went up by about 4pc every year.The slow pace of payroll growth has continued to puzzle economists, who say plunging unemployment rates, surging stocks, a shrinking labour force and stable federal spending should be prompting employers to allocate more to payroll.\u201cEvery construction firm owner you talk to says, \u2018We can\u2019t find pipe fitters, we can\u2019t find welders,\u2019\u201d said Anirban Basu, an economist with Sage Policy Group. \u201cEverybody is screaming about worker shortages but when you look at the data, wages aren\u2019t really accelerating.\u201dSo why haven\u2019t salaries risen faster?Akron survey administrator Angelo Kostopoulos describes a corporate environment where companies are \u201cstill trying to do more with less.\u201d The memory of the last economic downturn is still fresh in the minds of many managers, and it\u2019s leading them to be cautious about how they handle raises and bonuses. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if it stayed like this for several years to come,\u201d Kostopoulos said.Some say low inflation also gives managers leeway to keep salary increases small. The inflation rate for the United States was about 1.7pc for the one-year period that ended July, less than the average payroll increase.But even with inflation in check, the cost of living in the Washington area has increased significantly for some.Rents have skyrocketed, making it hard for newer residents to settle in for the long term, and housing costs have priced some D.C. natives out of once-affordable neighbourhoods.Others chalk the stagnant salaries up to changing demographics. Any gains that younger workers are getting are masked by the fact that baby boomers are starting to retire.Those baby boomers are often the most experienced, skilled and highly compensated people in an organisation. When they retire, they are often replaced by younger people who earn less.There are some corners of the local economy where pay increases are speeding up. There was a 9.7pc jump in median salary for marketing and sales professionals, possibly reflecting companies\u2019 efforts to expand after years of hunkering down. There was a 9.1pc median salary jump for legal professionals and a 6.2pc jump for IT workers, job categories that have historically paid well.Then there are the jobs where good pay is not just tied to a skill. Employees who have security clearances, a sought-after commodity in Washing\u00adton\u2019s contracting community, have received larger pay increases than people doing comparable work without a clearance.Among a sample of government contractors surveyed by Akron, 48pc said they offered higher pay for cleared employees, up from 43pc last year.\u201cThis is a clear reflection of the challenge of all companies in getting new people cleared,\u201d said Alan Chvotkin, general counsel at the Professional Services Council, which lobbies on behalf of government contractors.Cleared employees, many of them former military veterans, typically made between 5 and 15pc more than their non-cleared counterparts. Senior research analysts and high-level administrators earned 50 to 60pc more when they had clearances. Even receptionists can expect a 15pc bump in pay by virtue of holding an active clearance, the survey found.\u2014 Bloomberg/The Washington Post ServicePublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Aaron Gregg", "title": "Nine years since the recession, why are employers still stingy with raises?"}}

Its success came at the expense of the mainstream parties, making it harder for Merkel to form a working majority.Her best shot now \u2014 if she wants to avoid fresh elections that could further boost the AfD \u2014 is an alliance with two other parties that make for odd bedfellows, the pro-business Free Democrats (FDP) and the left-leaning Greens.Such a power pact \u2014 dubbed a \u201cJamaica coalition\u201d because the three party colours match those of the Caribbean nation\u2019s flag \u2014 would be a first at the national level in Germany.In the talks to come, likely to take weeks, all players will fight for ministerial posts and issues from EU relations to climate policy. All must give a little to reach a compromise \u2014 but not too much, to avoid charges from their own party bases that they are selling out in a grab for power.The smaller parties will seek to avoid the fate of Merkel\u2019s previous junior coalition partners: both the FDP and SPD have suffered stunning losses after governing in the veteran chancellor\u2019s shadow.Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Refugee issue complicates Merkel\u2019s bid to form govt"}}

However, renowned theatre and TV actor Khalid Ahmed and legendary ghazal singer Tina Sani had a different perspective that they shared with the audience at The Second Floor on Saturday night. While Khalid Ahmed shared his experience as a vocal trainer for actors and association with arts, Tina told the packed audience about her 40 years in music industry and her association with the best in the business.Mr Ahmed was the first to speak and he lamented that the current generation uses music as a shortcut to fame; instead of observing ustaads and learning from them, many students at the National Academy of Performing Arts first get makeovers to look like musicians and later on quit studies after understanding the basics. He also accused the patrons of not supporting musicians in Pakistan, which resulted in the decline of classical music in the country; something that still gets patronage from the government and the well-wishers in India. In his opinion, multinational brands should lend their support to the families of classical musicians because (a) even after 70 years, they are still not considered equal and (b) because the ustaads don\u2019t want their children to pursue music for monetary reasons. For them, their head waiter son gets more respect than they ever did and that is a shameful situation for us as a nation.Tina Sani, on the other hand, had a different perspective; the renowned singer disclosed to the audience that when she was growing up, she didn\u2019t know who Begum Akhtar was and that was because she belonged to her father\u2019s generation, not hers. However, with the passage of time, she managed to understand the basics of music and after becoming a ghazal singer learnt a lot from Mehdi Hasan and Tufail Niazi who were masters of the trade. She told the audience that most musicians were affected by Partition, as they had to start over in the new country. She cited the example of Tufail Niazi, who was a star in the Indian Punjab before Partition, so much, so that people first used to get dates from him and then set the date for their functions, most notably weddings. In the Sikh dominated area, people used to tease one another with Oh To Kera Tufail Ko Le Aana when people used to delay dates. When he migrated to Pakistan with his family, he opened a dairy shop in Multan because not many knew him in this part of Punjab. One police officer recognised him and helped him out with the instruments that migrating musicians had left behind, reviving his career in Pakistan. Others, however, weren\u2019t that successful, according to Tina, and when PTV allotted 4pm slot to classical music, it sort of pushed them further down the road.Tina Sani also told the audience that voice training has nothing to do with singing; she also rejected the notion of practising for more than 12 hours because, in the West, artists develop techniques to better their vocals, something we don\u2019t believe in. She compared American tennis stars Arthur Ashe and Serena Williams, saying that a lot has changed from the time when Arthur Ashe used to play just because now, Serena Williams knows how to play smartly, with better gadgets, improved techniques in less time. Tina also termed folk music Pakistan\u2019s very own since all musicians and singers who pursue folk are treated stars in their villages and are looked after by the rich. She also advised the youngsters willing to take music as a career to follow the master, not the leader since the leader will give them a refresher course, a master will send them out to venture and learn. After a brief question and answer session, the event concluded with Tina Sani singing Bol Kay Lab Azad Hain Tere that captivated the audience.Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Omair Alavi", "title": "The rise and fall of Pakistani music"}}

The paramilitary force did not allow Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal to enter the compound, prompting an outburst from him and a subsequent inquiry into who was responsible for the forces' deployment.
