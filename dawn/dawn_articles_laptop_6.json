Marri was detained last month by the Quetta deputy commissioner after being granted bail in the Justice Nawaz Marri murder case by an anti-terrorism court in Sibbi. He was earlier arrested upon his return to Pakistan from the United Arab Emirates after ending an 18 years self-imposed exile.  The divisional bench of BHC, comprising Justice Jamal Mandokhail and Justice Nazeer Ahmed Langove, ordered Marri's release, terming his detention \"illegal\".  The bench questioned the Additional Advocate General Shehak Baloch about the reasons for Marri's detention, to which Baloch said that the home department could answer the court's query. The home secretary is participating in a joint border commission's meeting with Iranian authorities and is, therefore, unavailable, he said.Dissatisfied with the answer, the court ordered Marri's release. \n", "author": "Syed Ali Shah", "title": "Police take Gazeen Marri into custody again for interrogation into terror cases"}}

Abe cut a contrasting figure by kicking off his offensive in the bucolic farming country of Fukushima, signalling his commitment to rebuilding the region hard hit by the 2011 nuclear power plant meltdown.He pledged a major expansion of social programmes, including offering free early-childhood education in a bid to get more women into work, while also talking tough on North Korea. In an obvious dig at Koike, he urged voters to consider his policies, rather than catchy soundbites. \u201cBoom and slogans do not open the way to the future. Policies unlock the future. We must not lose,\u201d he said. The 12-day campaign will be fought around reviving Japan's once world-beating economy and the ever-present threat of North Korea which has threatened to \u201csink\u201d the country into the sea. Koike's \u201cParty of Hope\u201d has swallowed up and replaced most of the main opposition party in the space of a week, transforming Japan's staid political landscape. But surveys suggest her bandwagon is grinding to a halt as she refuses to run herself for PM in the election, focusing on running the world's most populous city with three years until Tokyo hosts the Olympic Games. A poll in the top-selling Yomiuri daily suggested that 32 per cent of voters plan to vote for Abe's conservative LDP with 13pc for the Party of Hope \u2500 down six percentage points from the previous poll in late September. Referendum on Abe\nAbe is seeking a fresh term at the helm of the Asian economic powerhouse and key United States regional ally, and unexpectedly called a snap election to capitalise on a weak and fractured opposition. But Koike stole his limelight by launching her party, attacking Abe's government for being too slow to reform the country, weighed down by an ageing population, deflation and a huge debt mountain. Abe's trademark \u201cAbenomics\u201d policy \u2500 a vow to kick deflation and achieve 2pc inflation with stable growth \u2500 has largely fallen flat. Critics argue that Abe called the early election to divert attention from a string of scandals, including allegations of favouritism to a friend in a business deal \u2500 which the premier strongly denies. And analysts say the October 22 vote is effectively a referendum on Abe, who has enjoyed unrivalled political strength for the past five years in part because of a lack of credible opposition, while his key policies remained controversial or unpopular. For her part, Koike says her new group promotes \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d and hopes to distinguish herself from Abe by pledging a phase-out of nuclear power by 2030 and a freeze on a planned sales tax hike. Koike sceptics, however, charge that she repeats vague, catchy phrases and lacks details including how to pay for her ambitious projects. Rival conservative blocs\nMore than 1,000 candidates were expected to run for 465 seats in the all-powerful lower house \u2500 a reduction of 10 seats from the previous election. The outcome could create two rival conservative blocs with broadly similar diplomatic and defence policies, with fragmented leftist forces filling the gap, pundits say. Before the campaign kicked off, Abe's ruling bloc held a two-thirds majority, with his long-ruling LDP holding 287 seats while its junior partner Komeito has 35. Abe has said he would step down if his coalition fails to win a simple majority but few analysts see that as a likely scenario, especially as Koike's party is only putting up 235 candidates.\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Gloves off as Japan election campaign starts"}}

The strategic rivalry between the US and China means the latter\u2019s Belt and Road initiative is unlikely to be looked on with great approval by any US administration. But US Secretary of Defence James Mattis has controversially waded into the CPEC debate by claiming that the \u201cOne Belt, One Road also goes through disputed territory\u201d, an obvious reference to CPEC\u2019s route through Gilgit-Baltistan. The astonishing comment has seemingly aligned the US with India on CPEC and possibly even the Kashmir dispute \u2014 a potentially shocking development with far-reaching consequences that the Trump administration appears oblivious to.Indeed, for a US administration that has remained studiously silent about the atrocities by Indian forces in IHK, it is remarkable that a senior official has decided to weigh in on the Kashmir dispute in a manner that blindly supports the Indian position. When President Trump signalled a South Asia strategy in outlining his Afghan policy earlier in the year, was he really suggesting a plan of pitting India against Pakistan to further US strategic goals in the region? The mere possibility would have disastrous consequences for the region and beyond. Even from a narrower perspective, Mr Mattis\u2019s attack on CPEC is deeply troubling. The corridor\u2019s vast potential of helping Pakistan become a trading hub and grow and diversify its economy is universally recognised. For Pakistan, there is an inherent challenge to ensure that CPEC\u2019s maximum gains accrue to this country and not to outside investors, workers and communities. But CPEC is an undeniably historic opportunity and represents a commitment to Pakistan that is unrivalled.So why is Mr Mattis coming down on the wrong side of history and the wrong side of the true interests of the people of Pakistan in trying to tarnish the initiative? The US has hardly been rushing to Pakistan\u2019s economic assistance in recent times. In fact, its officials have routinely threatened to withhold legitimate economic assistance for all manner of perceived offences. Unhappily, there is a history of the US trying to bully Pakistan into staying strictly inside the US orbit of influence. The Iran-Pakistan pipeline, for example, was opposed by the US at a time of acute gas shortages here simply because the US was then pursuing the economic isolation of Iran. The pipeline ought to have been Pakistan\u2019s right to pursue and was in this country\u2019s clear strategic interest \u2014 but the US effectively vetoed it even though it was not apparent that American sanctions at the time necessarily applied to the pipeline. Now it is CPEC that appears to be in America\u2019s cross hairs.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Taking sides on CPEC"}}

The National Assembly Standing Committee on Science and Technology, headed by MNA Tariq Bashir Cheema, also passed the National University of Technology Bill 2017 paving the way for the establishment of the first ever technology university in the country. The university will impart technical education to students, mainly to take benefit from opportunities arising out of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). At a meeting, the committee discussed the performance of PCRET with its members observing that the organisation had failed to deliver. \nSecretary science and technology directed to submit report on failure of Pakistan Council of Renewable Energy Technologies\n\u201cWhat is the outcome of PCRET? I have been told that this organisation has failed to achieve any milestone,\u201d said the committee chairman, directing Secretary Ministry of Science and Technology Yasmin Masood to dig out the factors that contributed to the failure of the council. She was also directed to check the overall performance of PCRET and funds it had received since its inception 16 years ago. The committee directed the secretary to furnish a report so that in the light of it the committee could decide the future of the organisation. \u201cWe will see whether the council should be given the status of an autonomous body or not. We will also see whether the administrative control of the organisation could be given to Wapda or not,\u201d the chairman observed. The committee was surprised to know when Additional Secretary Ministry of Science and Technology Mohammad Ashraf informed it that PCRET had an annual budget of only Rs1 million for research while it spent around Rs110 million every year on non-development expenditure such as salaries to its employees. Earlier, MNA Sajid Ahmed said though PCRET had a state-of-the-art research lab but it was lying abandoned. \u201cWhen I visited the lab, I was told that it only operates when someone [from government] visits the facility otherwise the lab remains closed,\u201d he said. Dr Baqer Raza, the director general of PCRET, informed the committee that the council was facing several challenges because it had no legal status. He, however, said he had a plan to improve the efficiency of the organisation. PCRET was established by merging the National Institute of Silicon Technology (NIST) and the Pakistan Council for Appropriate Technologies (PCAT) in 2001. The organisation was supposed to be a prime institution of the country for coordinating research and development and promotional activities in different renewable energy technologies.

But winning wasn\u2019t easy. It took several armed forays over 70 years in Balochistan, urban and rural Sindh, and Fata to end revolts by irked minorities. Sans India, even \u201971 would have been won at any cost to the locals. But even that loss produced profit as post-\u201971 demographic destiny slowly became democratic destiny. So, both ways, Punjab has won Pakistan. But this isn\u2019t the end of history. Societal tussles are mainly about class, ethnic, ideological and institutional sway. Ethnic and ideological ones are, for now, over: Punjab conservatism has won big. The issue now is: who exactly from the province will rule Pakistan. Punjab has now turned on itself as its elites fight bitterly for class and institutional sway. Not even all of Punjab is involved, but mainly its northern urban conservative elites: industrialists (PML) vs institutional (army, bureaucracy and judiciary), private (PTI) and jihadi middle classes. But stay calm. The war is non-violent.The 2013 polls routed the centrist Sindhi PPP and made two Punjab conservative parties the key national foes. The dharna was the first salvo. The gloves again came off recently in this squabble. Panama gave easily what the dharna couldn\u2019t: the head of the head of the industrialists. Whether Punjab middle-class groups contrived this is unclear, but the verdict was glaringly weak and fanned gossip and turmoil.Some of those who lost from Punjab, ex-defenders of Pakistani ideology but floored by more potent others from there, are now talking about \u201971 like minority leaders. Nawaz retook the party head post with legislation as iffy as the judicial verdict unseating him. In this war, there are no principles, just crude interests and tactics. Some want Imran barred too. They don\u2019t trust his past: player, playboy, philanthropist and now politician.\nConservatism in Punjab has won big.\nEven the opposition head post may go from a centrist Sindhi to a Punjab conservative, now or in 2018. In fact, even the spoiler jihadi groups will now mainly be Punjab conservatives after the shock betrayal by Fata jihadi ex-allies. Milli (cynics call that short for military) is now into politics. The DG ISPR supports its move. Its flag vividly displays its aims. It\u2019s a redo and negation of the national flag, with the green making deep inroads to sharply shrink the white minorities\u2019 space. All these tactics have roiled Pakistani polity and economy. But the elites are too busy fighting to care. So politics is now mostly an all-Punjab conservative affair. It also runs KP politically, whose politics is with urbanites too. Once part of Punjab, KP is dominated by the two Punjab parties. Despite taming others, can Punjab\u2019s elites coexist given conservatism\u2019s flawed DNA? It defeats enemies but soon gets divided and creates new ones from within given internal rifts. The main goal for both middle and upper class conservatives is economic. But industrial conservatives don\u2019t need merit but allegedly thrive on fraud. The middle classes survive only on merit. The middle class too is divided. Pindi institutional elites are driven by power and prefer conflict with alike regional foes. This irks economic conservatives, who want regional economic ties. To sway society, the Pindi boys employ jihadis, which fill it with hate and violence. But the patrons lack either the intellect to see this or the ethics to care. Even this alliance is shaky. The high zeal on faith of the clients irks patrons, whose opportunism on faith irks clients. The battle now is about 2018. It will likely remain political as the Pindi boys can achieve their aims without taking over. Some among Punjab\u2019s divided middle-class conservative groups may ally against the PML-N then. But Nawaz is still popular and major rigging too tough and risky now. Some think Plan A may be to quietly fix enough swing seats to help the PTI win overall: so not match- but spot-fixing. Even if they win, the middle-class groups will soon start infighting. If the PML-N wins, there may be an impasse. But Nawaz and the Pindi boys will likely compromise eventually. After all, they\u2019re all conservative and have learnt their lessons. So the fight will resemble that of early-morning irritating cats perched on a wall eyeball to eyeball, which growl, scowl and half-punch for long, but then back off seeing that small mice make easier prey. Civilian sway may go up a bit, if we\u2019re lucky.Meanwhile, minorities and masses, mere spectators here, can only watch with awe as the titans of Punjab clash and wait with bated breath to discover their own fate. But patriotism, faith, CPEC and end-to-sleaze, the competing conservative slogans, cannot truly solve their problems.The writer is a senior fellow with UC Berkeley and heads INSPIRING Pakistan, a progressive policy unit. murtazaniaz@yahoo.com www.inspiring.pk.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "Dr Niaz Murtaza", "title": "Punjab contests"}}
{"1362836": {"date": "Updated October 10, 2017", "article": "LAHORE: \u201cNo one has ever achieved much from staying within the confines of a system...you need to create your own path.\u201d At the risk of sounding a tad affected, these sagely words from a seventeen-year-old student of A-Levels are an attempt to explain how he had managed to achieve a goal most of his cohorts would find unthinkable at their young age, and the message he wants to give students aspiring to build a career in science. Age, for Muhammad Shaheer Niazi, is a mere number that should never have to hold anyone back. The bespectacled curly-haired student from the Lahore College of Arts and Sciences (LACAS), Johar Town, A-Level Campus, got published a research paper in the journal, Royal Society Open Science, based on research he had conducted for the International Young Physicists\u2019 Tournament in Russia last year. Speaking to Dawn, Shaheer recalls that while preparing for the tournament at the laboratories at the Lahore University of Management Sciences (LUMS), Dr Sabieh Anwar, who leads the PhysLab initiative, handed him a thermographic camera. Like most 17-year-olds, he began by taking his own pictures, but also caught on camera temperature differences on the surface of a layer of oil in an electric field between a pointed electrode and a flat one (a honeycomb pattern appears on the layer of oil when high voltage is passed through). He used shadowgraphy to image the ion stream. This had not been done before. The team representing Pakistan at the International Young Physicists\u2019 Tourna\u00adment was given the electric honeycomb phenomenon to present on and Shaheer\u2019s twin sister, Khadija Niazi, was the team captain. He decided to write a paper on his findings but little did he realise what an arduous process it would be to make it publishable. The process of peer review, for example, took time. Professor Troy Shinbrot at the Rutgers University says, \u201cI read Mr Niazi\u2019s paper and thought it was really lovely work, but he needed help writing the manuscript in a publishable form. This was I think just a matter that the work was good, but the presentation needed polishing to strengthen his case. In the end, I referred him to a colleague, Dr Tapan Sabuwala, and the Okinawa Institute for Science and Technology, who generously agreed to spend the time working with Mr Niazi doing the necessary polishing. I\u2019m very glad to see the work published.\u201dSimilarly, Dr Sabieh was all praise for Shaheer\u2019s work. His website www.physlab.org carries the stories of all the team members who prepared for the tournament over three months and worked on solutions to \u201cmind-baffling physical phenomena\u201d including: electric honeycombs, hot water geysers, rollers on rollers, magnetic trains, ultra-hydrophobic water, acoustic metamaterials and mechanical machines to generate random numbers. Smiling broadly, Shaheer says it was his mother\u2019s dream for he and his sister to get papers published in journals. He received an acceptance letter for his paper shortly before his birthday last month. His sister Khadija Niazi got her paper published in the journal, NRC Research Press \u2014 a division of Canadian Science Publishing \u2014 last year. Her paper \u2014 Solving core issues of early physics education in Pakistan \u2014 addresses the problem of paucity of women interested in careers in pure physics and sciences, while discussing novel ways to reach a wider audience. \u201cI see both of my children developing careers in research,\u201d says Ayesha Ahmad, their mother. The twins are candid about how their mother was central to cultivating their interest in science and in pushing them to broaden their interests. Neither of the two wants to limit themselves to a single field. Shaheer, for example, is planning on conducting research into plant perceptions, which he admits is a controversial subject, but fits neatly with his interests in gardening and horticulture. Khadjia, on the other hand, believes that strict career lines and specialisations only inhibit one\u2019s intellectual curiosity. She is interested in bringing together seemingly immiscible disciplines (in her case, it is physics and journalism) to create something novel and get an increasing number of students in Pakistan interested in subjects that aren\u2019t usually taught at schools. The twins are all praise for the help LACAS gave them to pursue their research interests \u2014 from providing a portion of funding for the tournament, to allowing Shaheer to wreak havoc in the labs. \u201cMother used to tell us to think big and think ahead,\u201d Khadija says. \u201cShe made us brilliant.\u201d Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "Sarah Eleazar", "title": "Shaheer Niazi \u2014 teenager who put Pakistan on science map"}}

A local, Shehzad Prince from Spur No 3, said the graveyard established decades ago was being illegally used for cultivation of crops. Malik Azam Desi told Dawn that after the floods when this graveyard was destroyed, land grabbers occupied it and built their houses and cultivated crops, depriving locals of space to bury their deceased.

{"1362736": {"date": "October 10, 2017", "article": "A CANDID memoir by former US Defence Secretary Ash Carter provides a rare opportunity to better understand President Barack Obama\u2019s Syria strategy before it recedes into the historical distance. His many valuable insights raise one big question, however: why did the US even get involved?The apparent goal of Carter\u2019s detailed reminiscences is to establish his role in the defeat of the militant Islamic State group. The former defence secretary asserts that effective operations against IS and a specific battle plan, which Carter claims US and allied forces still follow (the two \u201cred arrows\u201d pointing toward Mosul and Raqa), took shape only after his appointment in February 2015. But, the self-serving part aside, Carter\u2019s 45-page report describes an effort that had few supporters in the region it affected.Carter blames the US withdrawal from Iraq for the emergence of IS. But even after the terror militia set up its \u201cstate\u201d, \u201cthe people of the region did not want invasion-sized forces to return:, the ex-secretary recalls. Throughout his two-year tenure, Carter had to \u201cease [Iraqi] Prime Minister [Haider al-]Abadi into accepting more US forces (which was controversial for him at home)\u201d. The Iraqi forces, too, initially were reluctant to fight, to the open irritation of Carter and US generals who had to keep prodding the Iraqis into action.Obviously, the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad was even less welcoming of US intervention, even when the US administration\u2019s idea was to set up local anti-IS forces from scratch \u201cby recruiting individual fighters, forming them into units, providing them training and equipment in Turkey and Jordan, and re-inserting them into the fight in Syria\u201d. Even though, as Carter explains, the idea was that these fighters wouldn\u2019t get involved in the Syrian civil war, Assad was well aware of what the US thought of him. Then, Carter came in and changed the plan, switching US support to existing paramilitary formations. \u201cAlmost all the real fighters were already part of ad hoc groups and all wanted to fight Assad as well as IS,\u201d he explains.It was after the US decided that this was OK that Assad made his case to Russian President Vladimir Putin. What Putin saw was US interference in the civil war, an attempt at regime change \u2014 something he had vehemently opposed in Libya, even quarrelling with then-President Dmitri Medvedev, who had allowed the Western interference there to go unchallenged. By arming and training anti-Assad groups, the Obama administration \u2014 and Carter personally if indeed it was he who brought about the change of strategy \u2014 drew Russia into the conflict.After Putin began the Russian operation in September 2015, Carter recalls persistent Russian efforts to establish a pattern of cooperation with the US. \u201cFrom that first moment, Russia sought to associate us and the counter-IS campaign with what they were doing in Syria \u2014 constantly telling the world of their desire to coordinate and cooperate with us, asking to share targeting and intelligence information,\u201d Carter wrote. He rebuffed these advances for three main reasons. First, coordinating with Russia, which was closely allied with Iran in Syria, could have weakened Iraqi Prime Minister Abadi\u2019s resolve to work with the US. Next, it could link the US to the \u201cinhuman\u201d Russian campaign (a questionable reason at best given the multiple civilian casualties inflicted by the US-led coalition). Finally \u2014 and I think most importantly for the Obama administration \u2014 \u201cit would naively grant Russia an undeserved leadership role in the Middle East.\u201dUnsatisfactory interactions with Russia, and Carter\u2019s struggle to stop John Kerry\u2019s State Department from making a deal with Putin that would involve military coordination rather than mere de-confliction, are described in a chapter about \u201cspoilers and fence-sitters\u201d. Apart from Russia and Iran, these include Turkey \u2014 which, according to the ex-secretary, \u201ccaused the most complications for the campaign\u201d \u2014 and the Arab neighbourhood, the Gulf states, which, Carter writes, \u201cwere active in lobbying and PR that somehow never translated into battlefield action\u201d.To sum up, US interests weren\u2019t clearly aligned with: Iraq, Iran, Russia, Turkey, the Assad government in Syria and the Gulf states. Did the US have any enthusiastic allies at all?Well, there were some of the anti-Assad rebels (except the ones wedded to Islamist causes) and, most of all, the Kurds. US support of them, of course, was the main reason Turkey turned from an ally into a \u201cspoiler\u201d. But at least someone really wanted the US to be involved, if for reasons that had less to do with IS than with the Kurdish dream of a sovereign state. Now, the Kurds of Iraq have voted for independence, justifying all the misgivings Abadi had about the US anti-IS operation.In fighting IS, the US managed to step on everybody\u2019s toes in a battered, short-fused region that was already leery of US interference after the Iraq and Libya adventures. Carter\u2019s account sheds light on how that happened, as much as into the mechanics of defeating IS. It explains why peace in the region won\u2019t be a given even after IS is gone: Carter himself writes that he\u2019s concerned \u201cthe international community\u2019s stabilisation and governance efforts will lag behind the military campaign\u201d. The account also raises the question whether a more lasting solution could have been achieved if Assad and his allies on the one hand and Turkey on the other had been left to deal with the IS problem without US interference.Counterfactuals, however, are useless. The US involvement has only intensified after the Obama administration left, and political stability in Syria and Iraq is ever more elusive as Middle Eastern nations and armed groups try to get used to the US/Russia/Turkey triangle of power brokers. Carter can proudly claim a part in bringing about this new, volatile configuration.By arrangement with Bloomberg-The Washington PostPublished in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "Leonid Bershidsky", "title": "Why did US even get involved in Syria?"}}

The Station House Officer (SHO) of Darakhshan police station, Ahsen Zulfiqar, had warned Jahanzeb earlier when Khan tried to file a complaint against him for mistreating her.The actress, in a Facebook post, accused that her family had rented and moved into Jahanzeb's apartment after her father's demise and had been subjected to unfair treatment at the hands of the landlord.\n \n\n\nShe claimed that the apartment, located in DHA Karachi, was in a \"disgusting\" condition, with a broken sewerage system and the electric circuits were \"faulty\" when they acquired it.She further alleged that Jahanzeb and his mother would visit their apartment and try to threaten and extort money from the family under the guise of maintenance charges that were directly paid to the building administration.When their contract expired in July this year, the actress asked Jahanzeb to pay back the three-month security deposit before the family vacated the house. According to Khan, Shahani refused to pay and disconnected the apartment's electricity. He allegedly also beat the electrician who was called by Khan's family to fix the electricity connection.Later, she claims, Shahani showed up at the apartment with \"four armed guards who pointed their rifles at [her]\".When Komal Khan went to Darakhshan police station to lodge an FIR of the incident, she claims SHO Zulfiqar advised her to negotiate with Jahanzeb's father Rafiq Shahani instead. The landlor's father then assured Khan that Jahanzaib will return the security deposit and asked them to vacate the apartment in a month's time.However, after Khan moved to another house with her family, she alleged that the Shahani family refused to pay them back and hit her uncle when he went to talk to them.Khan said she will pursue a case against the Shahani family who, she claims, are trying to intimidate her and her family because they are women. \n", "author": "Dawn.com | Imtiaz Ali", "title": "Actress Komal's 'runaway' landlord granted bail by SHC"}}

The problem is that the dress code is incredibly sexist... because for boys, jeans and t-shirts are fine.\" The head of security, Sartaj Hussain, while explaining the dress code, said that \"each university and institution has its own code of conduct for students, for employees. We also have one.\"\"For female students, we ask that their uppers should be knee-length. It is in our rules and we ensure this... We do check the students,\" he said. \"The visiting faculty [member] looked like a student, and the security officer thought she is a student. Practically, he does not pass remarks on female students. They [security officials] ask them [female students] to hand over their ID card and point them to a female counsellor, who will tell them better what has happened,\" he said. \"He asked her for the card, and she told him she is a faculty member. He said, 'Okay, you may go. Please speak to your HoD'.\" The correct procedure for addressing grievances is to approach the administration, Hussain said, adding that if the teacher had informed the administration of the official's misbehaviour, \"the administration would have taken action. They do take notice of such things.\" However, he admitted, he was not sure whether or not she had approached the administration. He said that there was no formal dress code outline for teachers in their professional contracts. \"Generally, it is understood that teachers are mature ... It it understood they are wise enough.\" Hussain confirmed there had been an inquiry into the incident, where the employee was questioned.  \"On this basis, the person may be fired,\" he added.When questioned about whether it was true that a disciplinary committee had warned students against dressing 'inaptly' because of threat from the Taliban according to a report on the Express Tribune, he replied: \"No, not right now. In the past, we had received an anonymous email [from them] saying we are on the 'high agenda' etc. It was forwarded to the Federal Investigation Agency.\" \n", "author": "Hufsa Chaudhry", "title": "IoBM fires security official for 'misbehaviour' with faculty member over 'inappropriate attire'"}}

Sitting next to her on the panel is her brother Murtaza Bhutto. | Photo: The Dr Ghulam Nabi Kazi Archives.\n\n\nWITH round-the-clock, rush-to-screen images and sounds that invigorate the public sphere but also often mesh information and entertainment into discordance, television in Pakistan has completed half-a-century with some stellar accomplishments and abject failures.In an era when socio-economic fissures intensify and technologies make rapid advances, new media economics hint that the next half century will bring radical changes to how the medium will distribute its message. Viewing on smart-phones has already leapt up. Television intrusively determines content because news TV has become the big gallery to which the aggrieved public, politicians, lawyers, judiciary, armed forces and the private sector play and posture. Social media frequently overtakes TV, but not always. While the medium of television \u2013 and the media at large \u2013 has virtually become the message, the media itself accepts no responsibility for framing the message(s).By inane, prolonged repetition of images and words, news television devalues its inherent capacity to enrich public knowledge. It magnifies and promotes the trivial to a scale undeserved. Fortunately, the non-news channels \u2013 global, national and local, state and private \u2013 periodically offer material that richly educates and entertains. The evolution of television in Pakistan over a 50-year period can be divided into two parts. Part I: 1967-2002 when Pakistan Television Corporation was the principal state monopoly (Prior to Part I, there was a five-year period when pre-PTV Corporation entities provided limited signals even though PTV itself was officially inaugurated in 1964). Part II: 2002-17, when privately-owned channels came into operation under licences issued by the Pakistan Electronic Media Regulatory Authority (PEMRA). Currently, there are 88 channels, including about 40 news channels.\n\nThe last 15 years have seen a surge in the number of television channels and radio stations in the country. Seen here is a typical newsroom at a leading television channel, keeping track of multiple rivals to ensure being on the top of the competition.\n\n\nWithin Part I, there was a sub-division. The first 10 years were so distinctive that even PTV could not match them in the next 40. With dynamic mobilisation of a wide range of talent, imparting training and skill development to hundreds, introducing innovative programmes, presenting for the first time a vivid daily portrait of the country\u2019s varied and vibrant people, PTV\u2019s first decade is aptly deemed the golden decade.\nFrom 1990 to 2002, the original monopoly was partly diluted. Shalimar Recording and Broadcasting Company, in which the federal government had, and still has, 56 per cent shares, was permitted to install terrestrial transmitters and re-telecast CNN to Pakistani audiences. Shalimar Television Network (STN) was also allowed to sell its non-news/current affairs time to a private party, Network Television Marketing (NTM), ignoring conflict-of-interest dimensions as NTM was aligned with an advertising agency. The STN system is now leased out to the ATV network.MONOPOLY TO CACOPHONY\nThe 2002-17 phase represents a dramatic shift from one extreme of pure state monopoly to another extreme of private excess. The past 15 years have seen a phenomenal growth of private investment in TV and FM radio channels. This includes creation of thousands of new job opportunities; training of manpower (with some noticeable exceptions!); provision of multiple choices to audiences; increased range of language options; expansion of political and public discourse to become far more inclusive of diverse partisan viewpoints than it had generally been during PTV\u2019s news monopoly; exposes of bad governance; improved presentation; occasionally well-written, directed and acted teleplays and serials; and, indeed, audacious caricature and satire.Yet, the breadth of choice is not mostly accompanied by a proportionate depth in substance. There is proliferation without purpose, abundance without nuance, articulation without introspection. If the state channel has a pro-government bias, many private channels, subtly or crudely, manipulate their content, project their own biases and imbalances.An obsession with events and incidents prevents examination of themes and trajectories, and legitimises sheer laziness behind the mask of chasing the \u2018news\u2019. Perhaps worst of all is the wilful neglect of aspects of culture, such as literature, classical music, painting, sculpture and theatre, while fashion shows, pop music and cricket become more \u2018sponsorable\u2019 content.Based on a flawed revenue model of total reliance on income from advertising, private channels are infested by the virus of commercialism and cutthroat competition for ratings. This has led to a climb-down in the standards of debate and decorum in most talk-shows.The valuable content-form of the carefully-researched, thoughtfully reflective film or documentary has almost disappeared. To be replaced by snappy \u2018sorts\u2019, \u2018sound-bites\u2019 or \u2018capsules\u2019 which are mostly superficial or sensationalist. Audiences are being brainwashed and conditioned with a surplus of conjecture, invective, mid-breaks, breaking news and futile frenzy. Attention Deficit Disorder is now a new media ailment, compounded by channels, and by smart phones.PIONEERISM AND ACRIMONY\nThus, overall, evolution has proved to be a mixture of trailblazing pioneerism \u2013 by both PTV and private channels at different times \u2013 as also merely imitative \u2018me-tooism\u2019. There was a purposeful state role both at the outset in the 1960s and in creating a turning point in early 2000s when the state voluntarily ended its monopoly.There is also a bitter acrimony between some private channels. This conflict further falsifies the myth of self-regulation which is actually a mask for self-interest.For a sector that speaks the loudest about transparency and accountability, there is little or nothing of either about the financial aspects of television channels, about actual revenue, sources of advertising incomes and rates. While, as private limited companies, all are obliged to file annual data with the regulators and relevant authorities, the public at large remains completely uninformed about possible conflicts of interest, questionable practices et al. Official regulation of private channels through PEMRA is marked by some creditable work in difficult conditions, including indiscriminate issuance of licenses with financial elements of eligibility receiving far more weightage than professional credentials of the applicants; using license and renewal fees to unduly accumulate income; attempts at strict enforcement of codes and rules often paralysed by legal stay orders that stay in place for years, instead of weeks; anarchy in the sub-sector of religious channels that commenced without licenses and have become untouchable for the wrong reasons; an inordinately large number of channels created by the blunder of permitting each of the 3,500 or so cable distributors to operate five of their own content channels, resulting in about 16,500 channels based on piracy of foreign content, and fragmentation of audiences; and lack of true independence as a regulatory body from the pressures of the state and the government.DOWN MEMORY LANE\n\n\nRight from \u2018Alif Noon\u2019 in its early days, PTV for long had a heavy dose of social satire that was much appreciated by the audiences. Seen here is a screen grab of the popular show Kaliyan which used puppets to amazing effect for more than a decade.\n\n\nBut when the present is too much with us, we owe the past a visit. And in PTV\u2019s case, the past is still present. PTV\u2019s first 50 years are a panorama of progressive change and regressive stagnation, of some promises fulfilled and enormous potential still unrealised. As the electronic visual gazette of the Pakistani state, PTV is a significant part of the country\u2019s media history. From official documentarist to formal witness of public events to the promoter of an aspirational national singularity, PTV is a day-to-day recordist as well as an unrivalled decade-to-decade archivist of the country\u2019s evolution over half-a-century.While it is only natural that several individuals made outstanding contributions to the evolution of television in Pakistan, the list was surely headed by Aslam Azhar whose exceptional gift for leadership this writer calls \u2018createlevity\u2019. This includes several others who rarely appeared on-screen but were \u2013 and are \u2013 well-known. They all highly deserve being named here but for space limitations.\n\nAslam Azhar was in many ways the grand master of television in Pakistan. His association with PTV lasted intermittently from 1964 to 1989.\n\n\nIn 2017, PTV still remains a sober, tonally-balanced broadcaster compared to the hysterical, screeching approach of private news channels. Succumbing to the \u2018breaking news\u2019 option only when state and government events so require, but that too in a comparatively staid fashion, the country\u2019s first channel is, to this day, its most well-behaved one.The pre-dominance of governmental intrusion into internal management is evident in the fact that, of about 30 tenures of managing directors in about 50 years, only six individuals from within the specialised cadre of TV professionals were appointed as the head. Chairmen, with only a few exceptions, have almost always been secretaries of the Information Ministry.This facet keeps PTV in the strait-jacket of a state entity. In its effort to ensure balance and fairness in news content and analysis, state ownership and governmental control are lethal. PTV is prevented from being seen as credible, to the extent that when it does attempt a balancing act, a strong predetermined perception obstructs a fair evaluation of its unconventional content.In terms of finances, PTV continues to enjoy the unfair monopoly of being the sole recipient of television license fees. Automatically added to electricity bills, the license fees subsidy contributes 65-70 per cent of its total revenue. It also receives annual allocations under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP), which is not always fully utilised. But it likes to have its cake and eat it too. Benefiting exclusively from the license fees, PTV also competes with private channels for commercial advertising revenue \u2013 unlike BBC within the UK which is the sole recipient of license fees but does not accept advertising.JUSTIFIED SCEPTICISM\nThis writer began his relationship with television as a sceptic who soon converted willingly into a freelance contributor. The context of association for over 50 years has changed with time: as viewer, independent content-provider, advertising practitioner, public-interest litigator, legislative monitor, cabinet minister-cum-media policymaker in three governments and drafter of the EMRA (1997), R
