The Socceroos face home-and-away clashes against the fourth-placed team from the CONCACAF federation for a spot at next year\u2019s World Cup finals in Russia. The opening tie is in Honduras on November 10 with the return leg in Sydney five days later. Aston Villa star Jedinak missed the Socceroos\u2019 final qualifiers with a groin problem, which also kept him out of their Asian play-off with Syria. But the experienced midfielder was included in a 30-man squad by coach Ange Postecoglou, whose future is up in the air amid reports he will quit regardless of whether they make the World Cup or not. Postecoglou has retained 22 of the 23 players involved against Syria, with only the injured Brad Smith missing. Striker Mathew Leckie and midfielder Marl Milligan were included although they both miss the first leg through suspension. The final 23 will be finalised next week, and Postecoglou said he was confident whoever was picked would help propel Australia to its fourth-consecutive World Cup appearance. \u201cThere are a couple of weeks before the group gets together so we will be monitoring the health and fitness of every player to make sure that the final 23 are available for what is going to be a challenging couple of games,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel that we are right on schedule with regards to our arrangements, logistics and intelligence for Honduras, and are comfortable that the work completed and decisions made so far will help us in our quest to qualify for Russia.\u201d He added that having the second leg at home would be a boost for the team. \u201cA large, vocal home crowd in Sydney for the second leg is something that everyone involved with the squad is looking forward to,\u201d said Postecoglou.

But Abadi showed unwillingness to meet Tillerson\u2019s demand.\u201cNo party has the right to interfere in Iraqi matters,\u201d a statement from his office read. It did not cite the prime minister himself but a \u201csource\u201d close to him.Predominantly Shia Iran and its Sunni rival Saudi Arabia are locked in a proxy war for influence in the Middle East.The international battle against the militant Islamic State group in northern Iraq since 2014 saw the United States and Iran effectively fighting on the same side, with both supporting the Iraqi government against the militants.Washington has 5,000 troops in Iraq, and provided air support, training and weapons to Iraqi government forces, even as Iran armed, trained and advised the Shia paramilitaries which often fought alongside the army.But the latest twist in the Iraq conflict, pitting the central government against the Kurds, is trickier for US policymakers. Washington still supports the central government but has also been allied to the Kurds for decades.Iran exhibited its sway over Baghdad\u2019s policies during tensions over a referendum last month in which the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region voted to secede from Iraq against Baghdad\u2019s wishes, Kurdish officials say.Baghdad responded to the vote by seizing the oil city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds see as the heart of any future homeland.Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards, repeatedly warned Kurdish leaders to withdraw from Kirkuk or face an onslaught by Iraqi forces and allied Iranian-backed fighters, Kurdish officials briefed on the meetings said.Iraq\u2019s Sunni neighbours, including Saudi Arabia, share Washington\u2019s concerns over Shia power Iran\u2019s influence in Iraq, where the population is predominantly Shia.The office of Abadi, himself a Shia, said the paramilitary forces were under the authority of the Iraqi government. \u201cPopular Mobilisation are Iraqi patriots,\u201d it said in the statement.Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also rejected Tillerson\u2019s statement.

The absence of such a strategy is acutely felt even as we celebrate this important success\u201d in Raqa, he added.Syria\u2019s conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests, but quickly spiralled into a bitter and complex civil war, with IS just one element in a shifting matrix of players.About 900 US ground troops, the bulk of them special operations forces, are in northern Syria, where they have provided critical support to a Kurdish and Arab coalition called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).The alliance has benefited from weaponry and technical know-how, with US commandos training the locals on how to call in air strikes.They get constant support from US-led coalition planes and drones, and the Pentagon sent a Marine artillery to help near Raqa, while US forces also expanded a runway for military cargo planes at a northern Syria air base.Cleaning up the mess\nMilitarily, the anti-IS fight in Syria is not quite over, with the militants still entrenched in towns and villages along the Euphrates River Valley.The IS militants have lost nearly all the territory they once controlled in Iraq and Syria, but are also establishing footholds in other countries such as Yemen and Afghanistan.Towns abandoned by IS are littered with explosives, mines and booby traps.We\u2019ll \u201csupport the stabilisation efforts in Raqa, and other liberated areas, to include the removal of explosives left behind by ISIS, restoring basic services, and supporting local governing bodies,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.President Donald Trump, who has spoken little about Syria or hinted at any sort of broader long-term strategy, faces a situation far different from when Barack Obama commenced military operations in Syria.Russia joined the conflict in late 2015, quickly tipping it in favour of President Bashar al-Assad, while the influence of Iran and Tehran-backed militias also grew rapidly.For John Hannah, senior counsellor for the Foundation for Defence of Democracies and former national security advisor to vice president Dick Cheney, Raqa\u2019s recapture is not likely to mark the end of US involvement in Syria.He said Trump\u2019s tough line on Iran \u2014 the president last week refused to certify the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 must translate to action to stem Tehran\u2019s influence in Syria.\u201cIf President Trump\u2019s strategy for countering Iran is to have any meaning at all, it must almost certainly include a robust effort to contain and constrict the IRGC\u2019s commanding role in Syria,\u201d Hannah told AFP, using the abbreviation for the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Published in Dawn, October 19th, 2017\n", "title": "After Raqa, US mly advised to keep regional realities in mind", "author": "AFP"}, "1367555": {"date": "November 01, 2017", "article": "KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that after the restoration of law and order in the city his government has embarked on a \u2018Safe City\u2019 project to keep an eye on the movement of people and vehicular traffic.

It was the Chinese Minister of Environmental Protection, Li Ganjie, stating at a news conference that a strengthened environmental protection system would eventually benefit the country\u2019s economic development. He was responding to public expectations to improve air quality. He also told reporters \u201cWe are fully aware of the problems we are facing. Coal accounts for a high proportion of the overall energy mix.\u201d Also, \u201cwe have too many commodities transported by trucks. Some companies avoid emission-control measures. Some local governments are not enforcing measures from the central government.\u201d He said that China will strive to comply fully with its own air quality standards by 2035.Resolve, perseverance, and determination are words that I would use to describe the Chinese response to tackling air pollution. It was not always this way. The Chinese (and the world) had a very bad understanding of the effect of air pollution on health, as recently as 20 years ago. \nChina is a great example of a country acting in a focused way to reduce air pollution.\nInitially, acid rain (from poor air quality) affected crops and damaged buildings in the 1980s in China, becoming much more prevalent by the 1990s. This rang the alarm bells for the Chinese government to take air quality seriously. The impact of air quality on human health was only just being understood better at the time. Some remarkable efforts followed, including the Chinese putting in place strict sulphur-emissions regulations for their coal power plants, realising that this was an important cause of their pollution. Due to domestic demand, this created a huge market for flue gas desulphurization technology, which the Chinese took on, significantly reducing the global price for this technology. Indeed, according to an industry report, by 2009, China was operating 379,000 MW of scrubbers compared to only 130,000 MW in the US. China is also the largest supplier of many types of air pollution-control equipment and several Chinese companies are the world\u2019s leading suppliers of electrostatic precipitators.  The air quality problem has continued to get worse resulting in the Chinese putting in place even stricter standards for coal plant technology (such as super critical plants) and also investing in other renewable technologies. They also continue to cancel planned and under-construction coal power plants. For example, in January 2017, China cancelled 103 planned and under-construction coal power plants, amounting to 120 GW capacity (yes, gigawatts, ie 120,000 MW). Air quality management is a continuous battle in China, given the extent of locked-in coal-based power generation, keeping China on its toes \u2014 even more so these days as the world, and China\u2019s own citizens, better understand the effect of poor air quality on their health. To their great credit, the Chinese keep this issue front and centre on many fronts, including their active championing of the Paris Climate Agreement, shifting away from a position of highlighting their low carbon emissions per capita and the \u2018right\u2019 of all Chinese people to own a (petrol-powered) car. And it is not about their citizens losing out either, but rather about doing things differently.Indeed, China is shifting deliberately towards an electric car future for its citizens. In doing so, China puts itself clearly in a high moral position, advocating for a better quality of life for its own citizens, as well as a global champion. At the same time, Chinese industry continues to actively help bring down the cost of both air pollution-control technologies and certain renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaic cells, making it a market leader. China is a great example of a country acting in a focused way to reduce air pollution, prompted by economic and health concerns, but it also shows how difficult it is to clean up if it is left too late. Today, with CPEC, Pakistan is poised for greater economic growth. Can\u2019t we also ask China for help on air quality, under the CPEC umbrella, so we can learn from them and avoid the problems that they face today? We might even be able to partner with Chinese industries to produce the pollution-control technologies we need to help control our own air quality.A few obvious areas on which to request help from China include the setting up of an air quality-monitoring system for our major cities, so we can actually monitor the pollution. We also need to strengthen the courses in our universities on air pollution, perhaps by partnering with the Chinese, so we can build Pakistani capacity to understand the problem, analyse the sources of pollution and develop the policies and measures to address it. Capacity building at the state and the national level of our government officials is important, so they can better develop and enforce appropriate environmental standards, which are the main policy tool for protecting human health, if applied properly. China consciously put in place training programmes, for not just its environment professionals, but for all municipal officials, on topics such as Strategic Environmental Assessment, to raise awareness of environmental issues. I know this, because I was one of the course lecturers, and the Chinese translated one of my books for teaching purposes. Learning about the different roles of the national government and the local governments in improving air quality would also be useful, given that in Pakistan, the 18th Amendment devolves the responsibility for environmental management to the provincial level, and rightly so, as they are closest to the ground. Just these four bits of primarily intellectual help from China could yield us a lot, such as a future in which we (and our children) could be breathing clean air.The World Health Organisation estimated that the mortality rate in Pakistan attributable to household and ambient pollution per 100,000 population was 87.2 in 2012. With a population of 177.9 million in 2012, that means that 155,000 deaths that year in Pakistan were attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution alone. Compare this number with the 62,574 people who died in Pakistan from terrorist violence between 2003 and Oct 22, 2017, with the worst year on record as 2009, with 11,704 fatalities, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal. When will we feel the pressure that it is time to act on air quality to protect the health (and life) of Pakistani citizens? It\u2019s time to leverage our special relationship with China to ask for help, in conjunction with CPEC, on a topic on which they are truly world experts. It would be foolish to let this opportunity pass us by.

These projections are even lower than Pakistan\u2019s $18bn estimates for the current year\u2019s foreign exchange needs.Meanwhile, the finance ministry was, behind the scene, in negotiation with local and international banks for short-term inflows to sustain national forex reserves of about $14bn \u2014 a threshold for three months of import cover \u2014 to remain an uninterrupted recipient of the World Bank loan.During this breathing space, Pakistan has to fill the gap for a longer sustainability through a combination of relatively cheaper sukuk (Islamic bonds) backed by assets collateral and traditional international commercial bond, totalling around $2bn with five- to 10-year maturity.The process is almost ready: banks selected, markets identified and targets firmed up, but the decision on the precise timing is as yet undecided.Though it is easier said than done, in an environment of heightened political and institutional temperature \u2014 to which Mr Dar and his political leadership had a fair share of contribution \u2014 the country still needs to calm the critical commentary that is creating a perception of crisis on the economic, security and political fronts.This is important because mark-up costs from international capital markets are directly linked to the vulnerability and eagerness factor of the fund-raising client.More importantly, doing so would be a test of PML-N\u2019s political maturity and negotiation skills to manage expectations of additional domestic resource flows to voters in an election year, and the security needs that have been constrained by disruption of about Rs125bn on account of Coalition Support Fund from the United States this year.Mr Dar has sent the message across that the security cost has increased from 17pc of federal budget four years ago to 21pc even though many allocations remain wrapped in other grants and Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).In this push and pull for a greater share in a limited pie, the powerful have always been able to secure the most, but a fine balance would depend on many variables.Under a tighter control on the purse this year, the Ministry of Finance has thrown the lowest first quarter fiscal deficit in 10 years \u2014 0.9pc of GDP \u2014 despite a higher-than-usual development expenditure and lower non-tax revenue yield.This is a significant sign as the country showed the highest full-year fiscal deficit in five years just last year and private economists forecasted a deficit of 1.5pc of GDP in the first quarter this year.On its part, the government has already passed on the additional security cost of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to the public at large by making its financing a part of the consumer tariff in case of all the power projects on the one hand, and the cost of other development PSDP projects on the other.On top of that, Mr Dar has been advocating setting aside at least 3pc of net divisible pool resources for additional security expenditure.Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has taken steps to pacify the environment. He has supervised healthy briefings to key stakeholders for a \u201cbetter understanding\u201d and sent outreach teams of revenue machinery to explain why filing income tax returns by every individual is a key to expanding the tax base.At the same time, he has directed the finance minister to create space out of the divisible pool under the National Finance Commission (NFC) to proportionately bear the burden of additional security costs \u2014 a proposal Mr Dar has been advancing for almost two years now without any result, except delaying the fresh NFC arrangement.Stakeholders need to rise above the impression of pointing figures and jointly put the house in order, both in economic and security deliverables, instead of scratching wounds that would help none.

At least 43 Afghan soldiers were killed and nine wounded in a Taliban-claimed assault on a military base in southern Afghanistan which saw the militants blast their way into the compound with at least one explosives-laden Humvee \u2014 a tactic used in three separate attacks this week \u2014 the defence ministry said. A security source in Kandahar put the toll at 50 dead and 20 wounded. But the real figure is likely to be higher because Afghan officials habitually understate the actual number of casualties. \nA police headquarters in Ghazni also comes under attack\nThe militants razed the base in the Chashmo area of Maiwand district in Kandahar province to the ground, according to the ministry. \u201cUnfortunately there is nothing left inside the camp. They have burned down everything they found inside,\u201d defence ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri said. Just two soldiers were known to have survived unscathed, with six unaccounted for, the ministry said, underscoring the shocking casualties that Afghan security forces have faced in their struggle to beat back the militants. More than 10 militants were killed, it added. US aircraft carried out an air strike during a counterterrorism operation in Maiwand on Thursday, a spokesman for US Forces in Kabul said, though he did not specify whether the target were militants at the base. Provincial officials said two Humvees were used in the attack which was condemned by President Ashraf Ghani. They said the assault might have been carried out with the help of insiders. The Taliban claimed the ambush in a message to journalists that said all 60 security personnel on the base were killed. Separately on Thursday, militants besieged a police headquarters in the south-eastern province of Ghazni, attacking it for the second time this week. Air strikes were called in to support embattled police personnel in the ongoing assault, which has killed two security forces so far, Ghazni provincial police chief Mohammad Zaman said. The strikes were not immediately confirmed by the US Forces. Officials said the earlier assault on the headquarters, which took place on Tuesday, left 20 people dead and 46 wounded. Thursday\u2019s attacks take the number of major assaults on security installations this week to four, with the total death toll climbing past 120, including soldiers, police and civilians. The Taliban used a Humvee as a bomb to blast their way into their targets in three out of the four assaults this week. The militants have been able to steal dozens of Humvees from security forces after taking over districts and raiding military bases across the country. US President Donald Trump vowed earlier this year to stay the course in Afghanistan, America\u2019s longest war.But the Taliban said the recent assaults were a \u201cclear message to the Americans and the Kabul government, that they cannot scare us with their new so-called strategy\u201d. \u201cWe are fighting back and winning on every front, Inshallah [God willing],\u201d spokesman Qari Yusuf Ahmadi said.Published in Dawn, October 20th, 2017\n", "title": "Afghan militants storm army base, kill 43 troops", "author": "AFP"}, "1367415": {"date": "October 31, 2017", "article": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has submitted a resolution to the Punjab Assembly, demanding abolition of entrance test for admission to medical and dental colleges.In her resolution, PTI MPA Nabeela Hakim Ali stated that hundreds and thousands of students and their parents were facing severe financial, academic and social issues owing to the entrance test that follow full-fledged FSc and equivalent examinations.

More than smoking, hunger or natural disasters. More than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.One out of every six premature deaths in the world in 2015 about 9m could be attributed to disease from toxic exposure, according to a major study released on Thursday in the Lancet medical journal. The financial cost from pollution-related death, sickness and welfare is equally massive, the report says, costing some $4.6 trillion in annual losses or about 6.2 per cent of the global economy.\u201cThere's been a lot of study of pollution, but it's never received the resources or level of attention as, say, AIDS or climate change,\u201d said epidemiologist Philip Landrigan, dean of global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, and the lead author on the report.The report marks the first attempt to pull together data on disease and death caused by all forms of pollution combined.\u201cPollution is a massive problem that people aren't seeing because they're looking at scattered bits of it,\u201d Landrigan said.Experts say the 9m premature deaths the study found was just a partial estimate, and the number of people killed by pollution is undoubtedly higher and will be quantified once more research is done and new methods of assessing harmful impacts are developed.Areas like Sub-Saharan Africa have yet to even set up air pollution monitoring systems. Soil pollution has received scant attention. And there are still plenty of potential toxins still being ignored, with less than half of the 5,000 new chemicals widely dispersed throughout the environment since 1950 having been tested for safety or toxicity.\u201cIn the West, we got the lead out of the gasoline, so we thought lead was handled. We got rid of the burning rivers, cleaned up the worst of the toxic sites. And then all of those discussions went into the background\u201d just as industry began booming in developing nations, said Richard Fuller, head of the global toxic watchdog Pure Earth and one of the 47 scientists, policy makers and public health experts who contributed to the 51-page report.\u201cTo some extent, these countries look to the West for examples and discussion, and we'd dropped it,\u201d Fuller said.Asia and Africa are the regions putting the most people at risk, the study found, while India tops the list of individual countries.One out of every four premature deaths in India in 2015, or some 2.5m, was attributed to pollution. China's environment was the second deadliest, with more than 1.8m premature deaths, or one in five, blamed on pollution-related illness, the study found.Several other countries such Bangladesh, Pakistan, North Korea, South Sudan and Haiti also see nearly a fifth of their premature deaths caused by pollution.Still, many poorer countries have yet to make pollution control a priority, experts say. India has taken some recent actions, such as tightening vehicle and factory emission standards and occasionally limiting the number of cars on New Delhi's roads. But they have done little about crop burning, garbage fires, construction dust or rampant use of the dirtiest fossil fuels.A court ban on firework sales before the Diwali festival didn't stop New Delhi residents from firing rockets and lighting crackers throughout Thursday night. They awoke on Friday morning to acrid, smoke-filled skies and levels of dangerous, lung-clogging particulate matter known as PM2.5 that went beyond 900 parts per million 90 times the recommended limit by the World Health Organization, and 22 times higher than India's own limits.\u201cEven though better pollution norms are coming in, still the pollution levels are continuously increasing,\u201d said Shambhavi Shukla, a research associate with the Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment, which was not involved in the Lancet study.To reach its figures on the overall global pollution burden, the study's authors used methods outlined by the US Environmental Protection Agency for assessing field data from soil tests, as well as with air and water pollution data from the Global Burden of Disease, an ongoing study run by institutions including the World Health Organization and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.Even the conservative estimate of 9m pollution-related deaths is one-and-a-half times higher than the number of people killed by smoking, three times the number killed by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, more than six times the number killed in road accidents, and 15 times the number killed in war or other forms of violence, according to GBD tallies.It is most often the world's poorest who suffer, the study found. The vast majority of pollution-related deaths 92pc occur in low- or middle-income countries, where policymakers are chiefly concerned with developing their economies, lifting people out of poverty and building basic infrastructure. Environmental regulations in those countries tend to be weaker, and industries lean on outdated technologies and dirtier fuels.In wealthier countries where overall pollution is not as rampant, it is still the poorest communities that are more often exposed, the report says.\u201cWhat people don't realize is that pollution does damage to economies. People who are sick or dead cannot contribute to the economy. They need to be looked after\u201d which is also costly, Fuller said.\u201cThere is this myth that finance ministers still live by, that you have to let industry pollute or else you won't develop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just isn't true.\u201d The report cites EPA research showing that the US has gained some $30 in benefits for every dollar spent on controlling air pollution since 1970, when Congress enacted the Clean Air Act, one of the world's most ambitious environmental laws. Removing lead from gasoline has earned the US economy another $6tn cumulatively since 1980, according to studies by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Some experts cautioned, however, that the report's economic message was murky. Reducing the pollution quantified in the report might impact production, and so would not likely translate into gains equal to the $4.6tn in economic losses.The report \u201chighlights the social and economic justice of this issue,\u201d said Marc Jeuland, associate professor with the Sanford School of Public Policy and the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University, who was not involved in the study.Without more concrete evidence for how specific policies might lead to economic gains, \u201cpolicymakers will often find it difficult to take action, and this report thus only goes part way in making the case for action,\u201d he said.Jeuland also noted that, while the report counts mortality by each pollutant, there are possible overlaps, for example, someone exposed to both air pollution and water contamination and actions to address one pollutant may not reduce mortality.\u201cPeople should be careful not to extrapolate from the US numbers on net (economic) benefits because the net effects of pollution control will not be equivalent across locations,\u201d he said.The study's conclusions on the economic cost of pollution measure lost productivity and health care costs, while also considering studies measuring people's \u201cwillingness to pay\u201d to reduce the probability of dying. While these types of studies yield estimates at best, they are used by many governments and economists trying to understand how societies value individual lives.While there has never been an international declaration on pollution, the topic is gaining traction.The World Bank in April declared that reducing pollution, in all forms, would now be a global priority. And in December, the United Nations will host its first conference on the topic of pollution.\u201cThe relationship between pollution and poverty is very clear,\u201d said Ernesto Sanchez-Triana, a lead environmental specialist at the World Bank. \u201cAnd controlling pollution would help us address many other problems, from climate change to malnutrition. The linkages can't be ignored.\u201d\n", "title": "Study finds pollution is deadlier than war, disaster, hunger", "author": "AP"}, "1367520": {"date": "Updated October 31, 2017", "article": "More than 200 people are feared to have died when a tunnel caved in at North Korea's nuclear test site after its latest detonation, a Japanese news report said on Tuesday.A tunnel collapsed at Punggye-ri in early September, days after North Korea conducted its sixth and the largest underground nuclear test on September 3, TV Asahi said, quoting unnamed North Korean sources.Some 100 workers were lost in an initial collapse.

Last year, the trade deficit touched $32bn, which was the highest in the country\u2019s history.The strolling to control the trade deficit, the government has moved from regulatory duties to non-tariff measures apparently to discourage imports. This step of non-tariff measures came to curtail imports after the imposition of regulatory duties on 26 new products (137 tariff lines) as well as hike in duty rates of 21 items (219 tariff lines).The rates of regulatory duties range from 10pc to 30pc on different items, which are generally consumed by affluent segment of society.The new regulations will apply on import of 581 tariff lines, which include products like dairy products, leather, animal, meat, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, garlic, vegetables, fruits etc. Most of these products were already subjected to regulatory duties as well.In the Import Policy Order 2016, the government had already put in place regulations for 439 and 157 tariff lines, respectively. The products notified on Friday will be in addition to the exiting ones. The new measures will now also give sweeping power to the customs officials while clearing goods at the ports.Under the regulations, goods clearance will require a certificate for compliance to quarantine requirements of animal quarantine department of ministry of food security and research Pakistan.In case of some products, clearance of import was linked with compliance to phytosanitary requirement and drawing of samples and testing of quality by Department of Plant Protection. Similarly, the importable product was also subject to valid special import permit, valid phytosanitary certificate and Plant Protection Release Order by Department of Plant Protection, Ministry of Food Security and Research.Earlier, there were no such stringent conditions attached with the import of these products. It was only mentioned in the Import Policy Order that the import of these products will be subject to the same terms and condition in the relevant act.\u201cWe have seen that products were cleared at import stage without looking into the quarantine phytosanitary requirement,\u201d an official of the commerce ministry said. These measures, according to the official, were not meant only to curtail imports but also aimed at checking import of substandard products especially food items.He said such measures were already in place in almost all countries including India. The authorities concerned were also directed to come up with similar regulations for all those tariff lines which were not covered so far. According to the FBR, the purpose of duties was to provide an enabling atmosphere for competition to local manufacturers and boost economic growth.The products which were subject to regulatory duties include betel nuts (Supari), betel leaves (Paan), cosmetics, fruit juices, tiles, footwear, tyres, handbags, tableware, kitchenware, and home appliances like air conditioners, refrigerators etc.The purpose of these duties is not the generation of revenue but to reduce the import bill of the country. \nMoreover, the local manufacturers or producers of such items would be able to better compete with the imported products, which is expected to improve Pakistan\u2019s economic growth and provide more employment.

Addressing a press conference, Mr Jaffery said tile and sanitary ware manufacturers support the 20pc increase in duty on import of tiles and ceramics, followed by imposition of 9-36 anti- dumping duty on imports of Chinese products. The move will help curb under-invoicing and dumping of inferior quality products in local market, he said. Mr Jaffery said importers were buying sub-standard tiles from different countries and dumping their excess inventories in Pakistan, affecting the sales of local manufacturers. Locally manufactured tiles are expensive due to 21pc sales tax, as well as high cost of inputs including wages and power prices, he added.He said anti-dumping duty on Chinese imports coupled with RD will give breathing space to the local manufacturing industry which is on the verge of collapse despite huge investments. Furthermore, it would also create opportunities for new investors and lead to job creation. Mr Jaffery claimed that in 2016-17, Shabbir Tiles suffered a huge loss of Rs190m due to dumping of imported tiles.

Furthermore, there is no change as far as major steel-sector items are concerned.\u201cIt may be too early to assess the exact impact of the regulatory duty on Pakistan\u2019s total imports. But it is likely to have some meaningful impact. As per initial estimates, the above measure may help curtail annual imports by $1-2bn besides generating additional taxes,\u201d it said.Another report by IIS Research highlighted a major change in the regulatory duty on imported automobiles. The government has increased the regulatory duty on completely built units (CBUs) by 10-20pc.\u201cWe believe this will bode well for local assemblers... there is strong auto demand on the back of economic growth and cheap auto financing,\u201d said the report.The regulatory duty on dairy products, steel and most apparel items has largely remained unchanged while that on electronic items, such as water dispensers and freezers, has gone up, said the report.Meanwhile, Pakistan Electronic Manufacturers Association Chairman Muhammad Farooq Naseem said in a statement that the government imposed the regulatory duty without consulting stakeholders. \u201cIf the imposition of this duty was inevitable, relevant authorities should have rationalised the (number of) items, the percentage of duty should have been cascaded, and adequate time for industries to hedge their exposure and manage their inventories should have been given,\u201d he said.Mr Naseem said electronic goods and home appliances, such as refrigerators, air conditioners and television sets, are not classified as luxury items internationally. \u201cOur products are classified as consumer durables, a necessity in the context of modern lifestyle \u2014 urban or rural,\u201d he added.He said such products are sold throughout Pakistan \u2014 from up-market urban centres for the elite to small towns and villages.

The decision-making on these issues had been held up at forums led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar pending detailed institutional consultative process or politico-economic concerns. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is making sure these matters are settled fast.In recent weeks, Prime Minister Abbasi, while presiding over a meeting of the federal cabinet, decided to empower oil marketing companies (OMCs) to independently set the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) without an updated market study. Simultaneously, the commission for dealers and marketing companies on the sale of petrol was also increased by about 33 paisa per litre.On the other hand, he reversed the deregulation of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) after almost two decades through the federal cabinet even though it should have gone to the Council of Common Interests (CCI). The initiatives for gas sector reforms were also taken on a fast-track basis, along with changes in the exploration and production mechanism of the oil and gas sector, but have so far been stalled following serious question marks raised by the provinces over the intention, manner and expected outcome of the process.\nThe subject was taken up in a curious manner. The summary was moved in a rush without the advance mandatory circulation and the decision was not officially announced\nHSD has a predominate share in Pakistan\u2019s petroleum consumption, used mostly in transport, agriculture and power generation, and is a major source of revenue to the government with growing consumption patterns. The decision on the HSD price deregulation was allowed despite a study conducted by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) \u2014 a public-sector institution \u2014 concluded two years ago that Pakistan\u2019s market was not fit for deregulation of two key petroleum products: HSD and petrol. Interestingly, the Planning Commission, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) also opposed the move to give up the government\u2019s powers to fix HSD pricing.The prime minister overruled the opposition and ordered a three-month try to the new arrangement with a review at the end. He went on to add that the deregulation of petrol pricing would be next.The Ogra\u2019s role was contained to the extent that it would develop a mechanism to monitor the OMCs commercial stock position and the dealers\u2019 inventory system, knowing well the fact that Ogra\u2019s total human resources was no more than 200 staff and it lacked the technical capability to judge product quality.The Planning Commission and Ogra disagreed with the petroleum division\u2019s argument that the deregulation of diesel prices will lead to increased investment and creation of additional storage capacity. They believed the same argument for the partial deregulation of the oil sector involving healthy incentives of \u2018deemed duty\u2019 was misused in 2000 for minting billions of rupees in additional profits instead of increasing storage capacity and infrastructure.The PIDE had concluded that the argument that deregulation would unleash competitive forces in the petroleum industry could be negated as three main OMCs held more than 80 per cent of the market share, with PSO alone occupying more than 50pc.An indicator of market concentration \u2014 the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) \u2014 for Pakistan\u2019s petroleum industry was close to 0.35, which showed a high level of concentration in the industry. High concentration in any market implies greater chances of non-competitive behaviour and cartelisation, leading to inefficiency, among other things.On the other hand, the federal cabinet went ahead with reversing the deregulation of LPG prices even though it was expanding the sector through LPG air mix plants across the country. The federal cabinet appointed a price advisory committee comprising managing directors of all the public sector LPG producers amid criticism by LPG dealers and marketing companies. They saw LPG producers as the key reason behind high domestic prices.This would create a unique regulatory environment where the advice of the regulated entities (licencees) would be binding on the regulator. The manner in which the subject was taken up was also very curious. The summary was moved in a rush without advance mandatory circulation to the stakeholders and the decision was not officially announced. \u201cDue to paucity of time, the summary could not be circulated to the concerned ministries/organisations,\u201d the summary to the cabinet said, adding that \u201cLPG prices will be revised by the Ministry of Energy (petroleum division) from time to time based on recommendations of the LPG pricing committee\u201d and will be notified by Ogra. Ogra warned that without a private sector industry representative, the price committee would attract suspicion of conflict of interest and hamper efficient regulation.The regulator put on record that the government could issue policy guidelines under section 21 of the Ogra law only after cabinet approval but any guidelines issued by the price committee \u201cshall be inconsistent with the law\u201d.

But the dropping temperature will gradually enhance the foggy conditions across the country.

Fog forms when warm air meets colder air and the water vapour in the air is cooled to become dense liquid like droplets in the air. However, a dense fog is created in the central and southern Punjab along with northern Sindh in the winter due to the presence of large water bodies, including rivers, lakes and ponds in these areas. Due to the same reason, there is no fog on the motorway from Peshawar to the boundary of the Salt Range with central Punjab.

However, soon after that rainfall, foggy conditions will prevail across Punjab with heavy fog in the plains due to the added moisture in the air and on the land surface. \u201cCold, dry and foggy conditions will prevail in November as rains have been suspended due to La-Nina conditions,\u201d said an official of the Met Office. \u201cThese conditions also add to nasal allergies, respiratory problems as well as dryness of the skin.\u201d The La Nina pattern develops in the winter and is the opposite of Al-Nino pattern which develops in the summer. Both these patterns occur due to abnormal temperature variations in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru, South America. During La Nina, the sea surface temperature of eastern Pacific Ocean becomes lower than normal which triggers a global pattern and in South Asia the rain bearing clouds coming from Europe move towards the north. Instead of coming to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, the clouds travel towards southern Siberia and the Chinese side of the Himalayas. However, experts expect an ample rainfall in December if the La-Nina phenomenon weakens.Published in Dawn, October 29th, 2017\n", "title": "Dense fog may envelop cities as dry weather persists", "author": "Kalbe Ali"}, "1365272": {"date": "Updated October 21, 2017", "article": "\n\n\u2018Lost\u2019 lawmakers meet\n\n\nSheikh Rasheed foresees end of \u2018Sharif politics\u2019\n\n\n\nPunjab minister Sarwar concedes most party members are \u2018confused\u2019\nLalika says MPAs never demanded or discussed Nawaz\u2019s replacement with Shahbaz\nSheikh Rashid predicts over 70 PML-N lawmakers will cut and run\n\nLAHORE/RAWALPINDI: A day after a senior PML-N legislator criticised the election of a disqualified Nawaz Sharif as the party head and suggested Shahbaz Sharif lead the ruling Muslim League instead, more people on Friday appeared to be willing to embrace the idea. Federal Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordina\u00adtion Mian Riaz Hussain Pirzada told reporters at the National Press Club in Islamabad on Thursday that Shahbaz Sharif should lead the party \u2014 apparently since Nawaz Sharif was facing trial in corruption cases. Editorial: Nawaz or Shahbaz?Differences between the two brothers and their heirs apparent \u2014 Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shahbaz \u2014 became public knowledge when Hamza chose to air his concerns before media after he and his father failed to dissuade the elder Sharif and his daughter from adopting a policy of confrontation with institutions, particularly after the Supreme Court announced its verdict in the Panama Papers case ousting Nawaz Sharif from office. Now it appears that Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has been cementing his position for an impending behind-the-scenes battle aimed at taking up the reins of the party, as he met long-time friend former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Friday to discuss party affairs with him. And one of the Punjab cabinet members, Raja Ashfaq Sarwar, conceded that the party lacked a clear direction and most of its members \u201care confused\u201d. The meeting between Chaudhry Nisar and Shahbaz Sharif was being seen as of great importance since both have been on the same page since the Panama Papers controversy emerged. \u201cBoth want Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz to avoid a clash with the army and the judiciary and face accountability without much complaint,\u201d a PML-N leader said. A close aide to Nawaz Sharif said that even if the court had restrained the former premier from holding the office of the party president the post might not have been given to Shahbaz Sharif on a platter. \u201cDo not rule out Maryam Nawaz\u2019s chances to don the cap of the party president in such a scenario,\u201d he said, adding that Shahbaz Sharif\u2019s role would remain confined to Punjab even after the next general elections. In a related development on Friday, Railways Minister Saad Rafique telephoned Mr Pirzada and asked him about his proposal to replace Nawaz Sharif with his brother. \u201cI told him [Saad Rafique] that what I had said is in the best interest of the party,\u201d Mr Pirzada said. There were, however, some PML-N politicians who remained unconvinced.Minister of State for Interior Affairs Talal Chaudhry said there could be a difference of opinion in the party but \u201cthere is one leader in the PML-N and he is Nawaz Sharif\u201d. Had anyone asked Shahbaz Sharif if he was interested in becoming the president of the party, he raised the question. \u201cSimilar ideas were floated during the Musharraf regime,\u201d Mr Chaudhry said, adding that after Nawaz Sharif, his brother was the most senior leader in the party and he was always there to rescue the party when such a time came. \u2018Lost\u2019 lawmakers meet\nThe situation has left the party\u2019s parliamentarians worried. They want Nawaz Sharif to give them a \u2018clear road map\u2019 going into 2018 elections and tell them who will lead them in the election campaign. They are having meetings in groups to share their growing concern about the future of the party and its direction. In background interviews, some PML-N legislators said it was the time both brothers (Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif) sat with the party men and told them how they would go into 2018 \u2014 with confrontation mode with the judiciary and the army or the party\u2019s development agenda. Besides, who will lead the party in the election campaign when Nawaz Sharif and his children are facing the graft cases. A few of the PML-N lawmakers endorsed Riaz Pirzada\u2019s criticism of the election of the party head and termed his proposal to replace Nawaz Sharif with his brother a \u2018workable solution\u2019. \u201cAt the moment most of us (parliamentarians) are confused and want Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif to have a sitting with us to give us a clear direction leading to next year\u2019s election,\u201d Punjab Minister for Labour and Human Resource Raja Ashfaq Sarwar told Dawn. Mr Sarwar has recently attended a meeting of a group of over two-dozen MPAs, mostly from south Punjab, in Lahore in which the proposal of either forming a forward bloc to negotiate better terms with the Sharifs ahead of election or backing Shahbaz Sharif as party president was reportedly discussed. Answering a question, Mr Sarwar laughed off at the idea of forward bloc in the PML-N, particularly in Punjab, and clarified that he and some 20 MPAs were invited by MPA Shaukat Lalika at his residence, where they discussed growing unrest in the party because of having no \u2018future\u2019 direction. \u201cSimilarly whenever the party legislators meet these days they discuss the same things,\u201d Mr Sarwar said and added that Nawaz Sharif on his return next week would be requested to give them time and decide the future action plan. \u201cSo far the idea of replacing Mian sahib with Shahbaz Sharif is a non-issue in the party. Nawaz Sharif is important for us and he has vote bank. But the party men want to know how to move forward,\u201d he said. Mr Lalika told Dawn that he had hosted dinner for his uncle, Ashfaq Sarwar, who recently performed Haj. \u201cI also invited about three dozen other party MPAs to the feast. We discussed the party matters and the coming election.\u201d He said the party was united under the Sharif brothers. \u201cWe never demanded or discussed replacement of Mian sahib with Shahbaz Sharif,\u201d he said. Punjab government spokesman Malik Ahmad Khan said: \u201cThere has been consensus in the PML-N that Mian sahib should remain the party president as it is united under his leadership. The whole politics of the party revolves around him. However, it is the advice of the pragmatists to the party president to restrain the hawks to neutralise the \u201cPML-N G.T. Road political discourse and NA-120 by-poll campaign\u2019s strategy of confrontation. There should be no confrontation with institutions\u201d. About the concerns of the party legislators, Mr Ahmad said: \u201cOur party men want elections. Confrontational path may delay elections, they fear. And at the same time if they are not told about who will be candidate for the office of prime minister after the 2018 election, at least they should be told who will lead the election campaign,\u201d he said. Sheikh Rasheed foresees end of \u2018Sharif politics\u2019\nMeanwhile, Awami Muslim League (AML) president Sheikh Rashid Ahmed has predicted that the PML-N is a divided house and its parliamentarians will leave the \u201cPakistan Muslim League led by Nawaz Sharif\u201d in the coming days. \u201cEarlier, I said 40 parliamentarians are ready to leave the party but now I am sure that more than 70 will do so, including Prime Minister [Shahid Khaqan] Abbasi, Chaudhry Nisar and Saad Rafique,\u201d the AML chief claimed at a public meeting outside his residence Lal Haveli in Rawalpindi. The gathering was held to protest against the government for \u201ctrying to bring changes in Khatm-i-Nabuwwat laws\u201d. Sheikh Rasheed said, \u201cNext three months are very crucial for Pakistani politics and before March all the corrupt and the ruling elite of PML-N will be kicked out.\u201d He said the politics of the Sharif family would come to an end the day when the Hudaibya Paper Mills case, which pertains to the \u201cmother of all crime\u201d, would open.Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2017\n", "title": "PML-N in a bind over ex-PM\u2019s fate", "author": "Aamir Yasin | Zulqernain Tahir"}, "1366938": {"date": "October 29, 2017", "article": "ISLAMABAD: Justice Aamer Farooq of the Islamabad High Court (IHC) on Saturday admitted a petition filed by the widow of a group captain of Pakistan Air Force, seeking an investigation into her husband\u2019s death.

As time passed and I lost my sense of wonder, my feet also began to drag along for boring, predictable walks to the town centre where I had nowhere to go in particular. My steps adjusted to their new, relaxed stroll more in tune with the slow pace of my new home. Then, a couple of years later, like other new mothers I began pushing my stroller every morning, along the same cobbled lanes, chasing the fading sunshine to warm a little one, on those very short, winter days. The social pressure for a baby\u2019s obligatory daily voyage into the outdoors \u2014 catching the air and light \u2014 was new to me, and frankly, a bit inconvenient. I remember growing up mainly indoors. It was either the heat, the poor security situation, pollution, the lack of walkable roads or simply a combination of all that kept us kids (especially girls) locked into our houses in Karachi. I now live in a small town in northern Italy, less than 15 kilometres from central Milan, but in every other way, far removed from it. It\u2019s not a place for the young and restless. Those who want more from life graduate from high school looking forward to their next big step \u2014 getting out of here. What remains is a mix of those who will inherit local businesses, marry their childhood sweetheart and rely on an army of grandparents to mind the kids, or those who, like the town itself, find comfort in their known, unchanging reality. \nAs Italy grapples with an influx of migrants, people of a small town in the Lombardi region wonder what\u2019s going on\nMy town thrives on convention and predictability. On a walk around the neighbourhood, well dressed and stylish Italians will be able to point out the school their grandmother attended, and the butcher she used that the family continues to go to. They know their neighbours since childhood and are likely to have married lovers who grew up in an adjoining street. Most families vacation in the same summer beach town and cruise down the same ski slopes every year. There is great comfort in knowing that everything will continue to fall into its own slot without any surprises and an entire year\u2019s planning is done an entire year in advance.Imagine the nervousness then when things around my townspeople began to change. Just within the last couple of years, two Chinese tailoring shops have opened up on my walk leading to the unchangeable town centre. In the centre itself, dark skinned, poorly dressed men and some women stand at street corners begging for money or selling children\u2019s books or toys to passersby. They are more likely to be from Nigeria, Gambia, Ethiopia \u2014 migrants who have made it to Italy\u2019s shore in extreme desperation. In the evenings, Pakistani and Bengali flower-sellers go from restaurant to restaurant \u2014 surprisingly they are free to enter and disturb the clients;  imagine beggars walking into a restaurant in Karachi \u2014 interrupting the Italian dining experience. Hijab-clad women are now seen shopping at the local weekly fruit market, and groups of Middle-Eastern men stand suspiciously in corners, speaking in unknown tongues that invoke fear and danger. Towns people think they are most probably selling drugs. \n\nThe city centre reflects the rapid multicultural change across the region| photos by the writer\n\n\nThe people of my town are left wondering: \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThis was also the caption on a photograph that appeared on one of my town\u2019s group pages on Facebook. Usually, people share pictures of lost dogs, stolen bicycles and beautiful sunsets, but here was a poorly-taken photograph of a group of young men sitting on a ledge outside the main train station. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d the post said. All the men in the photograph were African, poorly dressed, looking weak and exhausted, and perhaps to some, a threat. The comments were vitriolic. People ranted about the face of their town changing, and their sisters feeling unsafe walking back from the station in the evenings. They recounted their own interactions with \u201csuch people\u201d \u2014 one held a knife to an old lady\u2019s neck for money, another yelled out profanities to a passing Italian driver. Words like \u201cuncultured\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d were used repeatedly. \n\nMany asylum seekers get housing and food but have nothing else to do all day\n\n\nSurely, this change is making many people uneasy. The influx of migrants is common discussion at gatherings, dinner tables, and even amongst mommies at playgroups. There is usually concern, bordering on political correctness, which readily turns into anger when the same people begin posting comments on social media. There is no doubt that the situation is complicated and it has changed many people. My town, the last bastion of left politics in the Lombardy region, recently elected an anti-immigrant centre-right mayor to replace the centre-left local government. The political discourse by the right throughout the mayoral campaign was about \u201csecurity\u201d, \u201cour families first\u201d, \u201cghettoisation\u201d and halting the inflow of migrants into the town. One acquaintance has declared himself a \u201cracist, from now on\u201d on public fora because of how he now feels about black people. Another acquaintance views the hijab-clad women now seen regularly at the fruit market to be challenging the culture of the city. A friend mocked that the best way of getting a job and a house in Italy now is to swim up the shore of Sicily and pretend to be an asylum seeker. The state even gives you money for three cigarettes a day, she said. And she is herself a migrant to Italy. \n\nA sunny autumn day in a north Italian town\n\n\nI\u2019m worried about where this will lead because the tension is rising in all of Italy. In this year alone, over 95,000 people have arrived in the country by sea. These are people without jobs, without money, without many skills and in a country that has still not recovered from the economic crisis, is culturally insular and where the state is reaching levels of exasperation on how to deal with the growing number of arrivals. The migrants are desperate and either live in state-sponsored temporary housing, or lie homeless on the streets, near train stations, begging for money and dignity. They have introduced a whole new reality to small Italian towns and the sheer number is testing the country\u2019s economic and cultural foundations. \nI\u2019m worried about where this will lead because the tension is rising in all of Italy.

I see despondent, defeated and exhausted faces of migrants who steal short naps under trees or on public benches and then abruptly get up and go back to selling books or toys to parents of happy children playing in the piazzas. They don\u2019t belong to this town and to its sounds of laughter and joy.All those five years ago, I landed at the Milan airport on a one-way ticket from Karachi, flying direct with PIA. The crew told me that every few years, the Italian government offers to \u2018legalise\u2019 those who are in the country without the proper paperwork. When that process took place, PIA had to increase its number of flights for some time because people were finally able to go back home with a visa allowing return to Italy. At the time, I knew only one Pakistani already living in the town I would then call home. He sold flowers by night and helped out with some work as a labourer during the day. On my previous visits, he had shown me pictures of his four children who he left behind with his wife in Rawalpindi. He hadn\u2019t been back in five years. He was one of many young Pakistani men I have found in various countries who walk around with photographs of their children in their pockets \u2014 old pictures with folds on them, perhaps looking nothing like the children do now. \n\n\n\nPIA now flies only once a week, on Fridays. Last Friday it took with it, the charred body of a broken-hearted young Pakistani man. \u2018GF\u2019 was a 33-year-old asylum seeker, living at a shelter  home provided by a local NGO just a few kilometres from me, in another small town of northern Italy. On a mid-September Wednesday afternoon, he stood at a small parking spot on a roadside, between a grocery store and the post office, doused his body with petrol and set himself on fire. Passersby must have stopped and looked in absolute horror. On late afternoons, a nondescript road in small town Italy only ever sees parents walking with their children to a neighbourhood park, or old people sitting on benches watching the same world go by every day, used to a predictable stillness in the air. And in the middle of all this mundaneness, was this incomprehensible display of despondency by a man succumbing to his insufferable pain. And perhaps the only person who could make some sense of this anguish was a 20-year-old Egyptian, himself an asylum seeker, who intervened and threw his jacket onto the burning man, putting out some of the flames.Help arrived, as it does when emotional suffering becomes physically apparent. A helicopter took \u2018GF\u2019 to a hospital in Milan. During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, he passed away, unable perhaps to deal with the pain of the death of his child back in Pakistan, a few months earlier. This was grief compounded by separation from family, and the agony of having covered this difficult journey thus far, only to realise that there\u2019s no way ahead and no way back.The writer is a former television producer now living in ItalyPublished in Dawn, EOS, October 22nd, 2017\n", "title": "MIGRATIONS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EUROPE", "author": "Aliya Salahuddin"}, "1365840": {"date": "October 24, 2017", "article": "CLARK: A five-month battle against the militant Islamic State group in the southern Philippines that claimed more than 1,100 lives has ended following a final battle inside a mosque, defence chiefs said on Monday.The conclusion of the conflict ended immediate fears that IS would establish a Southeast Asian base in the southern city of Marawi.

In front of the building a weary woman sits on the ground leaning on her right hand for support, pain etched in every line of her face. All of a sudden, a shout rends the busy morning at Pims. An impassioned cry of: \u201cJeena ho ga, marna ho ga, dharna ho ga, dharna ho ga!\u201d (Life or death, the sit-in will continue.)   The cry for protest has come from a crowd of around 700 paramedics, doctors and support staff, who have been on strike for almost two weeks campaigning for their demand to separate Pims from the Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (SZABMU).Inside the OPD, patients wait in queues \u2014 men in their queue and the women in theirs. But there is no one behind the counter who could tell them where to go for treatment. A few yards away from the OPD, a young man with a fractured leg lies on a stretcher surrounded by anxious attendants awaiting treatment.   The situation inside the Emergency Ward is even more precarious. A few nurses run from one patient to the other trying to keep up with the number of patients they have to treat.  The patients will have to wait till 11am before they can be treated. For the last two weeks, the protesters gather in front of the administration department at Pims early in the morning and register their protest before getting back to work at 11am.Pims was merged with SZAMBU in 2013 when the university was established through a law passed by the previous Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government.The employees of Pims \u2014 one of the largest hospitals of the country and perhaps the only government-run state-of-the-art facility for patients in the entire northern region \u2014 say that this merger deprived them of basic rights such as gratuity, promotions, residence and other facilities offered to civil servants in federal departments.So they have decided to gather in front of their own \u2018Hyde Park\u2019 \u2014 the driveway in front of the Pims administration department \u2014 to demand a reversal of the decision. The protesters have given the government a deadline of Oct 18 to accept their demand for separation of the hospital from the university, and have threatened to escalate the protest if their demands are not met.  On this particular day, the protesters are charged up, rehearsing and bucking each other up to get ready for the final showdown.A dais has been set up for those who will make the speeches, while other staffers \u2014 some in uniform, others without \u2014 sit on chairs or stand in disciplined rows.     One of the speakers pauses mid-speech looking to catch a breath, and the warm air erupts with shouts of: \u201cVC ka jo yaar hai, ghaddaar hai ghaddaar hai. Hum sub aik hain, hum sub saath hain!\u201d(Whoever supports the vice chancellor is a traitor. We are one in our demand.)Raising his voice above the cacophony of sloganeering, Manzar Shah, a senior leader of the association, announces that they will set up beds and workstations in open air to treat serious patients in the OPD but will not work inside the hospital until their demands are met.Doctor Asfandyar Khan, another leader, suggests that they need to take the strike up a notch. \u201cEvery department has stopped working except one, the sanitation workers. We have asked them to continue working because that will be the final phase of the strike.

In Tests, Pakistan have handed out 229 caps, the latest being Haris Sohail. In One-day Internationals, Usman Khan was the 216th player to have received the privilege. Not all of them who were inducted made it, even though there were some outstanding talents among them. Consider Umer Akmal and Ahmed Shahzad, the latest to lose their places in the team. When they made their debuts, the great hope was that the two would anchor the next generation that was coming through. It wasn\u2019t to be. Both are now on the plate of katakut that will be swallowed whole, remembered only in passing as flavours of the moment or perhaps as analysts on the idiot box. But there were many others who lost their place despite needing more time to settle in or to sort their issues out. Below are seven batsmen who graced Pakistan cricket but were ushered out for one reason or the other, well before their Pakistan careers should have ended. \nUmer Akmal and Ahmed Shahzad have seemingly batted themselves out of contention but who were the other Pakistani batsmen whose promising careers were nipped in the bud? \nYASIR HAMEED\n\nYasir Hameed\n\n\nThere were murmurs that Yasir Hameed was addicted to naswar. Some believed the rumours, others didn\u2019t. But among the believers was the coach, Waqar Younis. Irked by having to constantly chide Hameed for his indulgences, Younis lost his cool when told that the batsman was now chewing naswar while on the crease.  The next time Hameed was padding up, Younis entered the dressing room and asked him to empty his pockets. Nothing there. Then the coach asked him to strip. Hameed did. Inside his undergarments was a packet of naswar, neatly stashed away from the prying eyes of his coach. That was the end of Yasir Hameed, a stylish batsman with a cover drive to die for but who became an advertisement for why professional sportsmen should stay away from drugs. ALI NAQVI\n\nAli Naqvi\n\n\nThe year was 1997 and South Africa had arrived in Pakistan for a tour that included three Test matches. Pakistan were searching for an opener and in came 20-year-old Ali Naqvi to partner skipper Saeed Anwar at the top of the order. Naqvi was so raw at the international level that the side match which got him selected was his first taste of first-class cricket in Pakistan (he had only played Grade-II cricket till then). The first match of the series was played in Rawalpindi. Pakistan handed debuts to three young men: Naqvi, Mohammad Ramzan and Azhar Mahmood. The first innings of the match was held together by two centuries, scored by Naqvi and Mahmood. While Mahmood batted supremely with the tail, Naqvi had been a constant as senior batmen around him came and went. The two ensured that Pakistan drew the match against a team led by Hansie Cronje and which boasted Alan Donald and Shaun Pollock in its bowling attack.But this sparkling beginning to his Test career proved to be a false start. He failed to score a 50 in the rest of the Test series, and although he was taken to tour Zimbabwe and South Africa in 1998, he didn\u2019t get a chance in the South African series and failed to impress in Zimbabwe. After playing five matches, Naqvi was dropped. He never returned to the team and another promising talent went to waste. MOHAMMAD WASIM\n\nMohammad Wasim\n\n\nThere was a time when the national selection committee was distributing Test caps like sweets, in the hopes of finding successors and backups to the batting line-up. Young Mohammad Wasim was the skipper of the Pakistan U-19 team, a technically correct batsman with style and elegance to boot. He got his chance against the visiting New Zealand team back in 1996, at the Gaddafi Stadium, after Wasim Akram pulled out of the match at the last minute. The 19-year-old\u2019s first outing bagged him a duck, but the second innings \u2014 a hundred in a losing cause \u2014 showcased the range of shots he could play in the \u2018V.\u2019 The on-drive in particular was divine as was his cover drive, both of which some believed were reminiscent of Zaheer Abbas. And while some of us believed that Pakistan\u2019s next big thing had been discovered, things didn\u2019t pan out that way. The 19-year-old got about a four-year look-in for the team, though never as a regular, but after 2000, he was summarily deemed not good enough. The numbers backed the selectors too: a Test average of just above 30 runs did not justify the bags of talent that Wasim had. His last Test was against Sri Lanka at Galle, where he scored a paltry 29 in what would become his last Test innings. Out of favour and perhaps out of luck too, Wasim headed to New Zealand in 2002 to play first-class cricket. With bags of runs under his belt, he was encouraged to return to Pakistan in 2005 so that he may be considered again for selection. But Inzamam-ul-Haq had become captain in 2003 and an air of religiosity now engulfed the team. The board and team management at the time believed that Wasim\u2019s dalliance with women fans and followers would inevitably drag the team into scandal. The captain\u2019s morality thus had the last laugh, depriving Pakistan of arguably the most aesthetic on-drives and cover drives since Zaheer Abbas graced the field.BASIT ALI\n\nBasit Ali\n\n\nHe was the second coming of Javed Miandad, while the original Miandad was still playing. On his day, he was as audacious as Miandad, could drag his team to victory from the jaws of defeat, and exasperated the opposition with his neat stroke-play. Ali was the like-for-like replacement for Miandad that Pakistan hoped would anchor the batting order for the next generation. But like many others, Ali scored a duck on his first outing against the West Indies in Port-of-Spain in 1993. The second innings saw Ali score a gritty 37 in a losing cause. Two more 50s followed in the remaining matches but over time, his inconsistency would go against him. But his debut series was also the one that arguably shaped his opinion about captain Wasim Akram as well as then vice-captain Waqar Younis. This was a time when there was no internet and news filtered through ever so slowly from other parts of the world. One morning, Pakistan woke up to news that Akram, Younis, fast-bowler Aqib Javed and leggie Mushtaq Ahmed had been arrested in Grenada. They were accompanied by two women tourists and a local man, on charges of \u201cbeing in possession of a controlled drug\u201d believed to be marijuana.Diplomatic intervention saved the Pakistanis of any major embarrassment but later on, the golden generation of Pakistan cricket became embroiled in match-fixing controversies. Ali eventually handed the following statement to a 1998 probe into match-fixing allegations: \u201cIt is absolutely false that I made some statement before Intikhab Alam confessing that I indulged in betting or match-fixing. It is also wrong that I retired because of the betting or match-fixing. As a matter of fact, circumstances created by the captain and the management were such that I had no option but to resign. Our team was divided into various groups after 1995. One comprising [Salim] Malik, Ijaz, Akram Raza, Ata-ur-Rehman and [Wasim] Akram and the other of Inzamam, myself, Mushtaq Ahmed and Waqar.\u201dBasit played his last Test in 1995 against New Zealand in New Zealand, and his last ODI in 1996 against South Africa in Sharjah. FAWAD ALAM\n\nFawad Alam\n\n\nDo you remember Graeme Hick? Yes the English batsman with 26 first-class centuries and widely considered to be a monster batsman at that level. Although Hick played 65 Test matches, his average of 31.32 was far below his 52.23 average at first-class level. The suspicion about him was that, as good a batsman as Hick was, he couldn\u2019t translate it on to international level because the standard of bowler at that level was a cut above the county level that he was used to. Many years later, in 2003, young Fawad Alam broke on to the first-class scene in Pakistan. His consistent scoring and handy left-arm spin would earn him a look-in at the national level in 2009, but as fate would have it, he never became a fixture in the squad let alone the team.In fact, under the captaincy of Misbah-ul-Haq when Pakistan\u2019s ODI team were struggling with their middle-order unable to rotate the strike, Alam remained in exile. Consider the talent that was introduced to the ODI team in Alam\u2019s place: Nasir Jamshed, Khalid Latif, Khurram Manzoor, Ahmed Shahzad, Umer Akmal, Umer Amin, Sohaib Maqsood, Mohammad Rizwan and Mohammad Nawaz to name a few. None of them could milk the bowlers for singles and doubles as effectively as Alam could. Perhaps it was Pakistan\u2019s desire to have boundary-hitters across their line-up. But it was a flawed strategy because often enough, the top would be wiped off by the opposition but not before the batsman had chewed up many overs in trying to get set. As a result, it came down to the likes of Misbah and Younis Khan to play the \u2018tuk-tuk\u2019 game to provide some respectability to the score. In the ODI game, in particular, Alam was and arguably still is a necessity. But his game isn\u2019t just restricted to ODIs, his Test average of 41.66 indicates solidity if not flamboyance. Alam was different to Graeme Hick in that he was translating his talent on to the international scene. And while Younis Khan in his brief stint as captain backed Alam, the selectors weren\u2019t convinced. Both his Test debut and his last Test came in the same year, 2009. His last Test, in New Zealand, was also Umer Amal\u2019s debut Test. The grapevine in the Karachi cricket circuit is that Alam\u2019s continued absence from the scene is because of his father \u2014 Tariq Alam made some friends in his playing days but seemingly made more enemies. Some also allege that a Karachi-Lahore rivalry is at play, with the Lahore-based PCB reluctant to hand over more Karachi-based players with responsibility. Notwithstanding the veracity of these claims, what we can all agree on is that one of Pakistan cricket\u2019s cult heroes has been hard done by. ASIM KAMAL\n\nAsim Kamal\n\n\nAt a time when Pakistan were struggling for some guts and consistency to the lower middle-order, they discovered Asim Kamal.  The year was 2003 and a gritty 99 on Test debut at the Gaddafi Stadium against South Africa proved that a special player had just entered the fray. He manoeuvred the field like Salim Malik, finding singles and doubles at will, and before the opposition knew it, Kamal was already batting on 30. The tour to India in 2005 confirmed that he was Pakistan\u2019s Wall. In a very short span of time, Kamal made a cult following. But Kamal was also a bit of a purist \u2014 given that he had established his credentials, he didn\u2019t take too kindly to the selectors putting him in the team for one series and dropping him the next. His last Test innings was also in Lahore, against England in 2005, where he scored a paltry five runs. A career average of 37.33 with no centuries in two years bear testament to another what-if story in Pakistan cricket. The worst part? So depressed was Kamal at his exclusion, at the Board, and at the system that he took a hiatus from cricket to rediscover his love for the game. He retired in 2015.ZULQARNAIN HAIDER\n\nZulqarnain Haider\n\n\nNever has a Pakistani hero gone out of limelight as quickly as Zulqarnain Haider did. The young wicketkeeper-batsman turned into a heartthrob overnight back in 2010 as he replaced Kamran Akmal in the line-up at Edgbaston and played a gritty innings of 88 in the second innings of his Test debut.The wicket-keeping mess seemed to have been resolved. But this was the summer of shame, as Pakistan cricket was buffeted by news that three of its superstars and match-winners were involved in fixing proceedings of a match. There was anxiety, there was fear, and there was suspicion. While Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were banned and put in jail, it was Haider whose career seemed to have nosedived the most.  Selectors believed he had more wicket-keeping potential than Kamran Akmal and stuck by him for a one-day series against South Africa in November. Midway through the series, however, Haider packed his bags, left the team hotel, and went to the United Kingdom in search of asylum. Nobody quite knows what transpired but the murmurs were that bookies had approached him and threatened him of dire consequences if he didn\u2019t relent. Much later, though, Haider said in an interview that he had \u201cspecific issues with a few players whom I won\u2019t like to name.\u201dHaider made his debut in the August of 2010. His international career was over in four months.The writer is a member of staff.

It serves as a shield from harmful ultraviolet B radiation from the sun. Ozone has a highly reactive molecule which contains three oxygen atoms. United Nations Environment Program Asia Pacific Regional Director Dechen Tsering, who was attending as chief guest, said ozone depleting substances generally contain chlorine, fluorine, bromine, carbon and hydrogen in varying proportions and are often described by the general term of halocarbons. Hydro chlorofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform are important human-produced ozone-depleting gases that are used in many appliances including refrigeration, air conditioning, foam blowing, cleaning of electronics components and as solvents.She appreciated the commitment of Pakistan to phasing out ozone depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol, which was considered to be the most successful global environmental agreement setting out commitments by every country in the world to eliminate production and use of the chemicals that damaged the ozone layer. The Kigali Amendment was sealed during the 28th Meeting of Parties to the Montreal Protocol in the Rwandan capital and sought to phase down production and consumption of hydro fluorocarbons (HCFCs) to avoid up to 0.5 degrees centigrade of warming by 2100.Participants observed that Pakistan was able to reduce 10 pc use of HCFCs by 2015 under its HCFC Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP). The country is on track to achieve more than 35 pc reduction in HFC use in air conditioning systems, refrigerators and other appliances produced by the industrial sector in the country. Secretary Climate Change Ministry Syed Abu Ahmad Akif emphasized the need to rationalize or optimize the use of natural resources to protect humans, biodiversity and environment from devastating impacts of natural calamities including ozone depletion.He said using electric appliances, particularly air conditioning systems and refrigerators prudently would help reduce pressure on our energy systems and local heat impacts in our urban areas.Published in Dawn, October 26th, 2017\n", "title": "Industrialists, environmentalists to work jointly to phase out ozone-depleting gases", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter"}, "1364900": {"date": "October 20, 2017", "article": "\n\n'Powerful man'\n\n\nShining a light\n\n\nFrance's answer to \u201cAmerica's Got Talent\u201d is being taken off air after the show's linchpin, Canadian entertainment figure Gilbert Rozon, was hit by allegations of sexual misconduct involving nine different women. Rozon, who also founded Montreal's prominent \u201cJust For Laughs\u201d comedy festival, is a jury member on \u201cFrance Has Incredible Talent,\u201d whose 12th season had been due to premiere October 26 until broadcaster M6 pulled the plug on Thursday. Nine women went public Wednesday with allegations of sexual misconduct by Rozon, triggering a shockwave in Quebec hard on the heels of the revelations targeting Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced movie mogul accused by dozens of actresses of sexual harassment, assault and rape. Rozen stood down later on Wednesday as head of Montreal's 375th anniversary celebrations and vice-president of the metropolitan Montreal Board of Trade, and later took to Facebook to apologise, while stopping short of admitting guilt. \u201cShaken by the allegations against me, I want to dedicate all my time to review the matter,\u201d Rozon wrote. \u201cTo all those who I may have offended in my life, I'm sincerely sorry.\u201d Rozon wrote that he was resigning \u201cout of respect for the employees and the families that work for these organisations as well as all our partners.\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke out on Thursday regarding the allegations, saying the issue of harassment \u201cmeans the world to me.\u201d \u201cI think we're seeing a moment of awakening, whether it's the news from Hollywood [...] or now what we're seeing in the Quebec cultural areas,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cIt's unacceptable for anyone to feel insecure or harassed at work, at home, in the streets.

Most worked in the arts, and some said they were teenagers at the time of the incidents, the latest having allegedly taken place in 2016. \u201cHe harassed me for several months,\u201d Anne-Marie Charette told Le Devoir. \u201cI felt really small, knowing that he was a powerful man. I had the strength to push him away, but not to go to the police.\u201d Others who accused Rozon of harassment or rape over the past three decades include television host Penelope McQuade, actors Salome Corbo and Sophie Moreau, director Lyne Charlebois, and entrepreneur Genevieve Allard. \u201cWhen this behaviour continues over decades and affects women of diverse backgrounds, I think it must stop,\u201d Corbo told Le Devoir. She alleged that Rozon sexually assaulted her when she was 14 years old. Rozon pleaded guilty in 1998 and was fined for sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman at a \u201cJust For Laughs\u201d reception, but the record was later expunged. He reportedly tried to caress the woman and bring her back to his hotel room, but she fled and informed the venue's managers of the incident.

The event, which began in 1983, is billed as the world's largest international comedy festival. His resignation came after Quebec humorist Guillaume Wagner publicly accused him of being an \u201caggressor\u201d in the wake of the snowballing allegations. Wagner said he was encouraged to speak out after another Quebec celebrity, TV show host Eric Salvail, was suspended over allegations of sexual misconduct this week. The Weinstein case has shone a light on Hollywood's seedy underbelly, but has also prompted women in and outside the film world to go public with allegations of assault and harassment, most prominently in the #MeToo phenomenon on social media.\n", "title": "After Harvey Weinstein, Canadian producer hit by sexual misconduct allegations", "author": "AFP"}, "1367746": {"date": "November 02, 2017", "article": "KARACHI: Police on Wednes\u00adday resorted to tear-gas shelling and baton charge and fired shots into the air to disperse a mob that blocked both tracks of the National Highway in protest against an anti-encroachment drive in Malir, officials and witnesses said.

Ms Farrukh said biennales took place in more than 100 cities of the world, signifying their association and relationship with those cities. It\u2019s primarily an art exhibition held at different places in different ways. The first biennale in the world was organised in Venice more than a century ago after which it spread to other parts of the globe. In the last two decades it gained tremendous popularity in developing countries. One of the reasons was that people wanted their art to be shown in their countries. More than 140 local and international artists would be exhibiting their work at Karachi Biennale. Twelve venues were chosen for the purpose, six of which were, Ms Farrukh said, on Bandar Road (now M.A. Jinnah Road), and one of which was NJV School. Pioneer Book House, Jamshed Memorial Hall and Frere Hall were some of the other places she mentioned. There was also Capri cinema at which a film made by a Canadian artist would be screened. Apart from exhibitions, activities had been planned for schoolchildren and families.    Trade union activist Karamat Ali said for the last 30 years Karachi had been a victim of wear and tear (toot phoot). Extremism had taken its toll on the city. Art provided us with an opportunity to think, and helped us come out of the atmosphere of fear. Journalist Ghazi Salahuddin said Karachi was dubbed by some a \u201cdangerous city\u201d.

I am struck by the overly positive read-out of the engagement in Pakistan\u2019s media. True, these efforts signify that the threat of an imminent breakdown of ties in the wake of US President Trump\u2019s unveiling of his administration\u2019s Afghanistan strategy has been averted. Still, we need to temper expectations. Ties remain in trouble. This won\u2019t change unless common ground is found on issues that really matter. One-off successes like the freeing of the kidnapped American-Canadian couple will offer breathing space \u2014 no more. For some years, Pakistan-US ties have been marked by persistent demands on both sides for the other to do more. However, there was also a recognition that they won\u2019t get nearly as much as they were asking for, and, more importantly, that there weren\u2019t any extreme measures worth the cost to force the other side to concede. The US has continued to press the issue of the Haqqani network and Afghan Taliban sanctuaries. Yet, previous administrations shied away from coercive measures against Pakistan, seeing these options as cost-prohibitive. Pakistani officials remained paranoid about America\u2019s long-term regional intentions. Still, there was no serious effort to pursue a regional policy without some sort of partnership with the US.  The desire to continue engaging remains intact on both sides. But the US ask that Pakistan eliminate Afghan insurgent sanctuaries has not changed. This is now a one-point agenda. Every conversation about Pakistan\u2019s long-term importance is in cold storage; the talk in Washington of employing coercive measures is louder than ever. Further, the current US foreign policy orientation holds a strong preference for quick, tangible results. \nThere\u2019s no room for complacency in Pak-US ties.\nThe dynamic on Pakistan\u2019s side doesn\u2019t instil much confidence in the future of ties either. Pakistani officials sense the delicacy of the moment and thus will want to work out feasible concessions to the US that signal positive intent and avoid harsh action. Beyond this though, acquiescing fully to the US ask regarding the Haqqanis and Taliban has never been seen favourably. If anything, the current environment will likely reinforce the reluctance to bite the bullet. I sense consensus within Pakistani officialdom on two points: the new US strategy is seen as one aimed at defeating the Taliban on the battlefield rather than politically accommodating them; and that this approach is certain to work to Pakistan\u2019s disadvantage (and to India\u2019s advantage). Corollary: all-out support to the strategy will continue to be seen as self-defeating. Also, while the aura of unpredictability around US foreign policy in general is making decision-makers nervous, it is also forcing some within the system to argue that Pakistan must proactively plan for a minus-US scenario. If so, Pakistan\u2019s current engagement with the US may signify a buy-time approach. Meanwhile, one could expect Pakistan to proactively try and influence US strategy, most likely by pushing for a politics-first approach that seeks to accommodate the Taliban sooner rather than later. Here\u2019s the problem. The US is set to remain focused on the sanctuaries and opposes any proposal that may detract from this. Pakistan will be hoping to use its initial flexibility (for example, by actions such as freeing the hostages) to pull Washington away from its maximum ask. Yet, the Washington policy community may interpret Pakistan\u2019s flexibility as evidence that Trump\u2019s tough talk is working. The inclination would be to hunker down further. But desired results on the US\u2019s principal ask will still not be forthcoming. At the same time, Pakistan\u2019s political appetite to absorb public rebuke would be limited in an election year. Any propensity by the political elite to respond emotively will further em\u00ad\u00adpower the Washing\u00adton voices who want to see Pakistan punished. And as temperatures rise, those within the Pakistani system advocating a minus-US formula will gain traction. This is a recipe for disaster. For things to work out differently, both sides must acknowledge the elephant in the room: a mutual feeling that each side\u2019s preferred endgame in Afghanistan is unacceptable to the other. Pakistan believes the US is pursuing a \u2018basing\u2019 strategy that will leave its troops and bases in Afghanistan indefinitely. The goal, as internalised by the policy enclave, would be to keep the region (Pakistan, China, Russia, Iran) off-balance; India would gain further ground. The US is convinced that Pakistan continues to provide active support to Afghan insurgents to prevent US gains and keep the Taliban strong to counter India. But the US does not buy Pakistan\u2019s take on India; it sees the military as paranoid in this regard. These deep divergences are not easily reconciled. Yet, till they are, the ties will remain on the brink.

Trotsky played a major role in the Bolsheviks\u2019 seizure of power in 1917 but was subsequently demonised as an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d due to his opposition to Joseph Stalin.The brilliant orator and Marxist theorist was forced into exile in 1929 and became an idol for the Western radical left.In 1940, Soviet secret police stabbed him with an ice pick in Mexico City on Stalin\u2019s orders.The eight-part biopic series titled Trotsky is set to air the first week of November.The title role is played by 45-year-old Konstantin Khabensky, one of Russia\u2019s most popular actors who starred in the hit fantasy movies Night Watch and Day Watch and also appeared in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\u2018Bloody role\u2019\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be objective a hundred years later, but we tried to produce a series based on real events,\u201d the show\u2019s main producer Alexander Tsekalo told AFP in a phone interview. \u201cTrotsky played an important and bloody role in the Russian revolution.\u201d In the first episode seen by an AFP reporter, an elderly Trotsky reminisces from his Mexico home about the 1917 revolution and the ensuing civil war between Bolsheviks and their opponents.Trotsky believes he is talking to a Canadian journalist but in fact this is Spanish agent Ramon Mercader, sent by Stalin to assassinate him.The series also shows his early life in the city of Odessa in present-day Ukraine.A prison warden beats him in solitary confinement and abuses him for his Jewish origins, telling him: \u201cRevolutionaries and Jews do not understand the Russian nation.\u201d Curiously, Trotsky subsequently adopted the prison warden\u2019s surname to replace his birth name of Bronstein.The series often makes reference to the Jewish roots of Russian revolutionaries, but the director denies it could be seen in any way as anti-Semitic.\u201cI am Jewish. We are not deciding the Jewish question, we need to decide the Russian question,\u201d Tsekalo told AFP.The show largely presents him as a ruthlessly calculating mastermind, however.In one scene, he orders every tenth deserter from the Red Army to be shot and hands a peasant his watch \u2014 before going back to his train carriage to put on another golden watch.An unwanted centenary\nTsekalo insists there was no censorship at Channel One \u2014 notorious for its exclusively pro-Kremlin news coverage \u2014 saying there was \u201cnothing to censor\u201d.Nevertheless he said he discussed scenes and the \u201cmessage\u201d of the show with Ernst.The series\u2019 take on history is that \u201cpeople should not be forced to take to the streets and revolution always means blood\u201d, Tsekalo said.This follows the Kremlin line.With Vladimir Putin in power for nearly 18 years, all talk of revolution is taboo and the Russian state seems unwilling to mark the 1917 anniversary.\u201cThe state is not participating in marking the centenary, it is only watching,\u201d said Russian historian Nikita Petrov from Memorial rights group. \u201cThe Kremlin\u2019s message is that all revolutions are bad \u2014 and especially those financed from abroad.\u201dThe Kremlin has condemned the popular uprisings in neighbouring Ukraine and Georgia that it alleges were orchestrated by the West.The Trotsky series is keen to portray the West as playing a key role in the events of 1917 too.In a scene from Trotsky set in Paris in 1902, a German agent asks Russian-born Marxist theorist Alexander Parvus how much he thinks it would cost to destroy Russia with a revolution. \u201cA billion marks,\u201d Parvus replies with a smile. Tsekalo says it is a \u201cwell-documented fact\u201d that the West wanted to destroy Russia because it was \u201cbecoming a strong capitalist country\u201d.Published in Dawn, October 19th, 2017\n", "title": "\u2018Rock n\u2019 roll hero\u2019 Trotsky gets Russian biopic for 1917 anniversary", "author": "AFP"}, "1367623": {"date": "November 01, 2017", "article": "ISLAMABAD: Out of 58 brands of paints used in homes across the country, 60pc were found to contain more than the recommended 90 particles per million (PPM) of lead, according to a report launched by an international organisation, IPEN on Tuesday.\u201cOf the paints sampled, 24 have dangerously high lead concentrations of above 10,000 PPM.

It states, amongst other things, that the incidence of pollution is changing: concerns about ambient air, soil and chemical pollution are now greater than apprehensions relating to impure household air and water. This type of pollution is produced by \u201cindustry, mining, electricity generation, mechanised agriculture, and petroleum-powered vehicles\u201d, each of which is growing in Pakistan. The fastest-growing polluters in the world are developing countries with high rates of growth coming from sectors that rely on these activities. This poses serious health risks to the most vulnerable populations, the poor, minorities and children. Beyond health, the study points out that pollution has consequences for the economy as well, and in some cases can reduce the growth rate of an economy by up to two percentage points. This is important to bear in mind for a number of reasons. First, winter brings with it the smog that usually engulfs parts of Sindh and Punjab, causing a spike in respiratory ailments amongst much else, besides disrupting travel and business. Second, our future growth is heavily dependent on some of the industries listed in the study as the crux of the problem, especially coal-fired power plants. It can be argued that we need these industries to secure our future economic growth, but it must be asked what is being done to assess and mitigate the pollution impact that they are going to have. Third, with our push towards large-scale thermal power generation as part of the capacity expansion plan these days, it must also be asked whether we are locking ourselves out of the revolution under way in clean renewable energy. That revolution is sweeping across the world, replacing power from dirty fuels and electric cars that reduce emissions, while we are investing further in 19th-century technologies that are not only expensive, but bring their own health hazards with them. In the case of climate change, Pakistan\u2019s argument has always been that it is not a major contributor of carbon emissions, and the impact is felt globally. But that cannot be said for pollution. We are already suffering from high levels of pollution, with some of the worst urban air quality in the region and the seasonal winter smog engulfing several areas of the country \u2014 and, in large part, the driver for this is local.

The situation was particularly alarming in south and central Punjab. It was not good in Lahore either. But the Environment Protection Department (EPD) officials said control over local pollution contributions thinned the lower layer of smog though its upper layer further thickened because of enhanced incursion of smoke and ash of the crop stubble being burnt on a large scale in the adjoining Indian Punjab. Officials claimed emissions from the Sahiwal coal power project too were contributing to pollutants causing smog in the plains of the province. Smog had developed in Punjab last year too, irritating eyes and throat, and causing breathing problems for people outdoors. People in Lahore and other cities in the central and southern Punjab are once again facing the same problems for the past three or four days as the authorities try to grapple with the situation. The general perception is rain is the only hope which can clear off the phenomenon. Officials said SUPARCO spotted 2,620 fire incidents through satellite in Indian Punjab in the last 24 hours. There were just 27 in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab where torching crop residues has been banned under Section 144. The authorities have registered 151 cases and arrested 43 farmers for violations. According to the EPD officials, smog was particularly thick in Bahawalpur, Multan, Okara, Pakpattan, Chiniot and Faisalabad due to two major factors -- rampant crop stubble burning and emissions from coal power plants in Indian Punjab and Rajasthan. \u201cThere are four such power plants in Indian Punjab and nine in Rajasthan close to Pakistan,\u201d an official said. Crop stubble burning is also causing smog over a large area in India, and media reports say it has failed to control the pollution-causing practice despite public outcry and censure by courts. The EDP officials said smog was creating problems for people in Bhakkar and it has also reached KP\u2019s Dera Ismail Khan and Sindh areas adjoining Punjab. \u201cOnly rain and strong westerly wind can reverse the worsening situation,\u201d a Met department official said. He forecast dry weather in the next at least one week. An EPD official said more steel re-rolling mills were sealed in northeastern Lahore in the last 24 hours (Thursday), raising the number of such mills to more than 130. There are 350 mills in the city and the remaining have been allowed to function on the condition that they would not burn used tyres. As many as 11,203 smoke-emitting vehicles, mainly diesel, have been challaned and 1,145 impounded in Lahore and other smog-hit cities in the past few days.Published in Dawn, November 3rd, 2017\n", "title": "Punjab, other provinces grapple with debilitating effects of smog", "author": "Intikhab Hanif"}, "1367965": {"date": "Published Nov 03, 2017 03:50pm", "article": "\n\nNot always a Christian shrine\n\n\nA symbol of Partition\n\n\nThe smoke of the hashish spread through the air as Basheer took a puff from his cigarette, staring at me through kohl-smeared eyes. He had a thick, long white beard, though his hair was neatly trimmed. Through the open buttons of his kameez, I could see a taveez hanging from a black thread. Such an amulet usually contains verses from a holy book written on a piece of paper. I wondered what holy book Basheer had \u2013 the Quran, the Bible or the Granth Sahib? Sitting with his back to a small shrine in an open field, he handed over the hashish-filled cigarette to his young companions. Were they here just for a smoke or did the shrine represent something to them?Hashish and bhang (both made from cannabis) play a central role in folk shrines across the country. I call them folk shrines because most of them, despite their outward religious associations, do not strictly fall within the bracket of religious traditions. They represent an indigenous religiosity that connects the thread of diverse religious traditions of this land. Sufi malangs have in their poetry and literature referred to hashish as al-luqaymah (little green bite), musilat al-qalb (what binds with the heart) and waraq-i kheyal (leaf of insight). In several Sufi shrines across the country, one would come across devotees gathered around a fire smoking hashish or consuming bhang. Similarly, in ascetic traditions associated with Shaivism, the consumption of hashish is almost part of religious rituals. In Vedic literature, the use of cannabis is mentioned as a bestower of joy, a liberator.\u201cThis is the shrine of Baba Gur Baksh Masih,\u201d Basheer told me. Masih is the Arabic word for messiah, a title reserved for Jesus Christ. It is a word the Christian community uses today for its self-identification in Pakistan. However, it is not the word Muslims use for the Christian community \u2013 they use Isaai, followers of Prophet Isa, the name for Jesus in the Quran. While Isaai is now popularly recognised as the word for Christians in Pakistan, it is not a title the Christians necessarily associate with. However, power relationships between the two communities have forced this identification upon them, despite their reluctance. This is similar to Muslims being referred to as Mohammadens. Many Christians in Pakistan also use Masih as a surname.Not always a Christian shrine\nThe shrine behind us was a simple structure \u2013 a short boundary wall with no roof, with the grave of the saint at the centre, covered in green cloth, similar to the cloths used to cover graves at Muslim Sufi shrines. Like in Sufi shrines, a turban and garlands decorated the grave, symbolising the groom and bride-like relationship between the saint and the divine. Green, a colour usually associated with Islam, was used to paint the decorative niches and false architectural pillars. At the entrance, however, was a cross, identifying this as a Christian shrine. In fact, this shrine in the small village of Maraka, about 20km south-west of Lahore, is popularly known as Isaaian da mazaar (shrine of Christians). Once again, one can tell that this is not a name chosen by the devotees of the shrine.But this was not always a Christian shrine. \u201cBaba Gur Baksh Masih was a follower of Guru Nanak,\u201d Basheer said. \u201cHe lost his life in a battle. During combat his head was severed but his body continued to fight until it eventually came and rested at this spot, where later a shrine was constructed to commemorate his life and death.\u201d\n\nBasheer at the Isaaian da mazaar in Maraka village. Photo credit: Haroon Khalid.\n\n\nThe history told by Basheer and several others in rural Punjab who have not had a formal education is not measured in years but through events. In this framework, Partition becomes a pivotal point, the ultimate divider of eras. Basheer does not know exactly how old this shrine is but knows that it predates Partition. So, in its original form it would be fair to suggest that instead of a grave, this shrine must have hosted the smadh of Baba Gur Baksh. Perhaps it did not actually contain the remains of Baba Gur Baksh but was a symbolic shrine built to commemorate the legend of Bhai Gurbaksh Singh, who sacrificed his life to defend the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar from the onslaught of the Afghan king Ahmad Shah Abdali. Whatever it was in its past incarnation, the shrine today serves as the central communal space for Christians of the village. They not only gather here for the annual festival of the shrine, much like devotees of a Sufi shrine, but also for conventional Christian celebrations such as Easter and Christmas.A symbol of Partition\nThe story of this shrine is the story of Partition. Maraka was a pre-dominantly Sikh village whose occupants fled to the other side of the border to escape the bloodshed. However, several of these wealthy Sikh landlords left behind servants to look after their property and belongings. Like millions of others, they felt the riots of Partition were a temporary madness and they would return to their ancestral homes as soon as the situation returned to normal.The majority of Christians who live in Maraka today are descendants of the servants of those landlords. Most of them were Mazhabi Sikhs, a title reserved for Sikhs who converted to Sikhism from lower castes. Sikhism in this case was no different from Islam in South Asia. Both these religions were principally against the caste system but in practice retained remnants of caste hierarchy. Lower caste Hindus who became Muslims came to be known as Musali or Deendar and in many cases continued to be treated as untouchables. In Sikhism, they became Mazhabi Sikhs.For as long as they could, these Mazhabi Sikhs retained their religious identity. But as soon as the fire of the riots approached, they cut off their hair, removed their turbans and embraced Christianity, a neutral religion, to stay alive. Christianity from Partition onwards became a part of their identity. The shrine of Baba Gur Baksh, too, eventually saw this transition. Similar to the name Isaai, the Christian identity, too, was forced on this shrine and the community.\nThis article was originally published on Scroll and has been reproduced with permission.\nHave you visited any places that promote social harmony?

The department predicts thickening of smog much beyond the human tolerance level in the next 15 days. \u201cWe expect thickening of smog in the next 15 days because of the increasing smoke from the burning stubble mainly in Indian Punjab. Crop stubble is also being burnt in our cities but the present and the expected level of burning on the Indian side is alarming,\u201d said an EPD official on Tuesday. He said in view of the predicted alarming situation, which Pakistani Punjab witnessed last year, the department had written a letter to the Ministry of Climate Change requesting it to take up the matter of crop stubble burning with India authorities through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \u201cWe can do this on the pattern of Asean countries which have signed an agreement to tackle smog caused by forest burning in its member countries,\u201d the official said. At present smog in Lahore remains thick in morning. Though it continues to persist throughout the day, in evening smog in the city causes eye and throat irritation. According to EPD and the Met department, people in Lahore are these days facing the same level of smog they had experienced last year due to burning of used tyres by nearly 350 iron and steel-rerolling mills, large scale construction of roads, underpasses and the metro train, and mainly crop stubble burning in Indian Punjab. Official sources, however, claimed that at present smog in the city was 50 per cent less than its recorded level during this season last year.

An official said that Suparco, the national space agency of Pakistan, had through its satellite caught over 100,000 burning spots in Indian Punjab last year. The actual happening was much intensive because the satellite focuses Punjab just for five minutes thrice a day. The figure recorded on Wednesday was 5,000 and was bound to rise, he said.

The report claims that almost 22 per cent of premature deaths in Pakistan are attributable to pollution \u2014 and this comes to about 300,000 deaths annually. This is more than the deaths caused by road accidents in the country, or three times the combined toll of tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS. These are stunning findings and have caused a global stir. A 2014 World Bank study, in a similar vein, pointed out that more than 22,600 deaths per year are directly or indirectly attributable to ambient air pollution in Pakistan. \u201cOutdoor air pollution alone causes more than 80,000 hospital admissions per year, nearly 8,000 cases of chronic bronchitis and almost five million cases of lower respiratory\u201d problems among children under five.The urban air pollution levels in Pakistan are amongst the world\u2019s highest, and intensely damaging for human health and quality of life. Pakistan is the most urbanised country in the South Asian region and the direct and indirect costs to our urban, peri-urban and rural standard of life are accelerating. This is degrading our environment, and eroding our economic growth rate. The pollution in low-middle-income countries like Pakistan is estimated to cost 2pc of GDP and almost 7pc of health spending. \nThe urban air pollution levels in Pakistan are amongst the world\u2019s highest.\nTo make things worse, most of this cost is borne by the poor. Marginalised groups, particularly women, children and the elderly, get disproportionately affected. Yet, the commission\u2019s economic analysis does not include the information about the cost of environmental damage caused by pollution, nor does it fully address the challenges and opportunities offered by climate change to address the root causes of pollution.  Despite adverse effects on human health, the pollution issue has traditionally been ignored by the policymaking community in Pakistan. National and provincial assemblies have not enacted any significant legislation to curtail pollution. The manifestos and platforms of political parties are silent about air pollution, industrial emissions, use of chemicals, or technology or fuel import standards. The ambient air quality or industrial emissions standards are inadequate, fragmented and poorly enforced. The capacity of environment protection departments in the provinces has evaporated over the years despite the 18th Amendment that devolved greater environmental responsibilities to them. Their budgets are negligible and enforcement capacities questionable.Pakistan has the highest greenhouse gas emissions intensity in South Asia \u2014 more than India. We emit more GHG emissions per unit of GDP than any other country in the South Asian region. This structural inefficiency adds to the cost of doing business as well as to the national health bill. Worse, Pakistan\u2019s overall trends indicate a steady increase in emissions per unit of economic output over the past few decades. This is expected to further accelerate owing to rapid increase in population, the growing number of mega and intermediate cities, inadequate public transportation and the absence of mass transit systems, heavy reliance on fossil fuels and recent investments in coal-fired power plants. According to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) document that the federal government submitted to UNFCC Secretariat in 2015, the emissions are projected to more than double during the next decade. If the present trajectory of business as usual (BAU) continues, Pakistan, according to the NDC, will need $40 billion to offset these increases. Add to this the institutional complexity and their standard practice of working in silos. The regulatory agencies and research groups that focus on agendas for environmental health and pollution control operate in two distinct domains. Key sources of pollution-health nexus \u2014 air, water, soil, industry and chemicals \u2014 are regulated by different national and provincial agencies. This often results in competing policies, interests and fragmented understanding of the full scale of pollution and its share in the national burden of disease. The Lancet Commission report has provided a unique opportunity to our national, provincial and city governments to give deeper thought to how best to change this state of affairs.  Going forward, our commitment to Agenda 2030, also known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provides a window of opportunity to curtail pollution over the next 15 years. Robust and long-term programmes to protect the health and lives of people through national pollution-control programmes are needed at the federal and provincial levels. The prime minister needs to set up an inter-ministerial commission to design and deliver Pakistan\u2019s pollution management programme. A series of targeted, well-integrated interventions should reach out to millions of Pakistanis through pollution-monitoring networks in the provinces, a consolidated regulatory framework for pollution control and using command-and-control measures that include ambient air standards, emissions standards and technology standards. For this to happen, the government must: a) link air quality to health indicators by focusing on reducing pollutants linked to higher morbidity and mortality, particularly fine particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and lead content that are several times higher than WHO air quality guidelines; and b) link with cleaner production by focusing in particular on such industries as cement, fertiliser, sugar, steel and power plants, and on brick kilns, plastic moulding, and other waste-burning industries.Curtailing pollution is essential for meeting the following SDGs: SDG-1 (poverty alleviation), SDG-3 (improving health), SDG-6 (access to clean water and sanitation), SDG-10 (promoting social justice), SDG-11 (building sustainable cities and communities), SDG-13 (climate change) and SDG-14 and 15 (protecting land and water). Their successful implementation will help curtail pollution that disproportionately kills the poor and vulnerable. Pollution control can benefit greatly from efforts to decarbonise economic development and mainstream renewable energy to slow the pace of climate change in Pakistan.The writer is CEO of LEAD Pakistan, an Islamabad-based think tank specialising in environment and development issues.Published in Dawn, October 28th, 2017\n", "title": "Kill pollution, save lives", "author": "Ali Tauqeer Sheikh"}, "1365211": {"date": "October 21, 2017", "article": "ISTANBUL: With focus on upgrading its communications and energy infrastructure and enhancing regional connectivity under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Pakistan on Friday sought enhanced trade and economic partnerships with D-8 member states through stronger rail, road, air and sea links.

The ninth summit, hosted by Turkey, adopted the Istanbul Declaration 2017 and the D-8 Istanbul Plan of Action, reaffirming the group\u2019s commitments to establish peace, democracy, and solidarity among the member states. In the declaration, the D-8 leadership took stock of progress in various fields,  including energy and economy, while expressing mutual hope that implementation of development projects and programmes would make the partnership visible and tangible to the people of the member states. On the occasion, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi handed over chairmanship of the organisation to Turkey. Addressing the opening session of the summit, Prime Minister Abbasi said Pakistan assumed the chair of the organisation in November 2012 at the eighth summit in Islamabad, which adopted two landmark documents \u2014 the D-8 Charter and the Global Vision. The documents provided the essential basis for joint endeavours, he added. The summit, whose theme was \u2018Expanding Opportunities through Cooperation\u2019, was attended by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev, Iran\u2019s first vice president Eshaq Jahangiri and the vice president of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla.

In his address, Mr Abbasi pointed towards the stagnation of intra-D-8 trade, after an initial increase, saying the apprehension that the target of $500 billion in 2018 \u2014 envisaged in the 2008 Kuala Lumpur Summit Roadmap \u2014 might remain elusive. \u201cIt is, therefore, important for us to implement various instruments and agreements aimed at facilitating trade amongst member states, especially those related to preferential trade, small and medium enterprises, customs, simplification of visa matters and civil aviation,\u201d he added. Sectoral meetings at the ministerial level had already chalked out the roadmaps, and now was the time for implementation, the premier urged the members. On the occasion, Mr Abbasi expressed gratitude for the hospitality extended by the Turkish leadership to the Pakistan delegation since their arrival.

The department\u2019s development budget for 2017-18 is Rs540 million, said Deputy Director (Development) Tahir.\n", "title": "Lahore smog: EPD takes action against pollution-causing factories, vehicles", "author": "Umair Rana"}, "1365406": {"date": "October 22, 2017", "article": "LAHORE: Punjab Environmental Protection Council has been reconstituted by Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif with its first meeting held late on Friday here in the Civil Secretariat.

Pakistan is expected to use these ships in its Combined Task Force deployments.The 75m corvette is a multi-purpose platform for addressing both conventional and asymmetrical security threats. According to Swiftships, the corvette can also deploy rigid-hulled inflatable boats for special operation forces missions and for board, search and seizure operations. At a speed of 15 knots (27.74km per hour), the corvette has a range of 4,000 nm and endurance of 25 days. It has a top speed of 30 knots. The corvette can operate in sea conditions of up to Sea State 6, which is very rough with four to six metres high waves. If built with steel, the Swift Corvette would have a displacement of 1,640 tons, while an aluminium superstructure would enable for a displacement of under 1,000 tons and speed of over 30 knots.A Pakistan specific defence and analysis group, Quwa, reported that in June, the Pakistan Navy signed an order for two offshore patrol vessels (OPVs) from Damen Shipyards.

Speaking at the National Assembly\u2019s foreign affairs committee, the minister said that despite spending 16 years in Afghanistan fighting the Taliban, US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson could not get out of the air force base in Bagram during his visit to the country earlier this week. Meanwhile, making a jibe at the Afghan leadership, Mr Asif \u2014 who is known for his own brand of witticism \u2014 said Afghan President Ashraf Ghani was called to Mr Tillerson\u2019s bunker for talks. Mr Tillerson had visited Afghanistan on Monday for a couple of hours and held meetings with the Afghan leaders at the air force base because of security reasons. His journey from Qatar to Afghanistan was also cloaked in secrecy.\nSays Islamabad is ready to extend  support in the fight against terrorism\nMr Asif implied that this episode reflected the security situation in Afghanistan and how the American strategy for the country was faring. He said Pakistan would not allow itself to be scapegoat for someone else\u2019s failures, though it was ready to extend sincere support in the fight against terrorism for the sake of peace in the region. \u201cThere would be no compromise on the national interest,\u201d he said, assuring the legislators that all dealings with the US would be carried out transparently. The US has alleged that terrorist sanctuaries exist on Pakistani territory from where the insurgency in Afghanistan is being sustained. Mr Tillerson, during his visit to Pakistan, said that relationship with Pakistan would be conditional in terms of whether or not it acted on the \u201cspecific requests\u201d from US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cWe have extended to Pakistan certain expectations we have of their government and their leadership to deal with, in particular these organisations, the leaders of these organisations \u2026action to be taken to begin to deny these organisations the ability to launch attacks against others,\u201d Mr Tillerson told journalists in Delhi. On Wednesday, Mr Asif told the Senate that Pakistan received a list of 75 wanted terrorists \u2014mostly belonging to the Haqqani network \u2014 from the US. At the committee meeting, the foreign minister, alluding to the decline in the number of drone atta\u00adcks in Pakistani areas, said it was not because the US had run out of missiles, but because there wasn\u2019t much here for them to target. Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar, the new chairman of foreign affairs committee, observed that it was a moment of truth for the US in Afghanistan and urged the Trump administration not to turn the differences into disputes. He noted that Pakistan\u2019s response to President Trump\u2019s South Asian policy had been collective, measured and based on realistic assessment of the situation. Mr Bakhtyar, who has previously remained the minister of state for foreign affairs, emphasised the importance of engaging the US in promoting peace in Afghanistan. He expressed the hope that the US would stop seeing Pakistan through the Afghan prism and instead work on a broad-based relationship which would benefit both countries.

Except that on a recent day in August, not a leaf is stirring. The ride on a road that branches off Karachi Thatta National Highway and leads to Pakistan Steel Mills is as suffocating as it is bumpy.Right where the road enters the vast premises of Pakistan Steel Mills, a verse from the Quran is displayed on a billboard: \u201cAnd we have sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people.\u201d A few feet away, close to 25 men can be seen sitting under a shamiana \u2014 they have been staging a sit-in here since August 3, 2016.Right next to them is the Mills\u2019 main entrance, named after Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Behind it lies 19,000 acres of land that houses various constituent parts of Pakistan Steel Mills: 20 different plants, including a thermal power station, forklifts, warehouses, conveyor belts, railway tracks, stockyards.Dozens of industries, including vehicle manufacturing factories and a steel mill, are located on a part of the same land. They were originally meant to draw their raw materials from Pakistan Steel Mills. \nNo machines whir, no plants hum, no furnaces radiate inside the Mills.All 20 of its processing plants are shut. In an area fenced off to block entry without permission, 5,000 tonnes of rusted metal sits untouched \u2014 or so it seems. This was produced when the plants were running. \nOperational furnaces produced so much heat that no one could walk\nunderneath them without protective gear. Now, they look like museum\npieces.\nAn insulated two-way conveyor belt \u2013 about 4.5 kilometres long \u2013 appears to be in perfect shape, even though it has not moved an inch for over a year. It used to carry raw material such as coal and iron ore from the docks at nearby Port Qasim and transported manufactured goods to the port. Its insulation ensured that those materials were not exposed to the elements and their surface temperature was maintained at a desirable level \u2014 a marvel of technology and architecture. Also read: Is privatisation the solution to Pakistan's financial problems?Large deposits of iron ore lie in an open yard. Amidst them sits a giant Soviet-era forklift. It is under maintenance. A similar contraption in the empty coal yard looks like it is still in the middle of finishing its last task. These machines are capable of shifting 1,000 tonnes of coal or iron ore in one hour from the yards to the conveyor belt that then carries them to different plants. Something written in Cyrillic script appears right on top of them. When these machines were operational, they kicked up a storm of dust so thick that no one could see them from a distance.Twelve railway coaches are parked inside a wagon shop. They once fetched molten iron ore from one part of the Mills to another. They are regularly maintained and can be put back to work at short notice. Two blast furnaces at the Iron-Making Department stand idly, held steady by their frames. The giant ladles that once shifted processed iron ore from the furnaces onto the railway coaches stand motionless and empty \u2014 like the outstretched hands of a beggar.\n\nInside Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nThe smell of gas that once fuelled the furnaces still pervades the environs. Insulation around the pipes that carried gas, compressed air and water to the furnaces is coming off. When the department was functional, this insulation required continuous maintenance. Operational furnaces produced so much heat that no one could walk underneath them without protective gear. Now, they look like museum pieces, with onlookers inspecting them from all possible angles, without the fear of any hazard or harm.    Also read: Plane truths\u2014How costly is it to keep PIA flying?The Mills has an integrated structure. All its plants and machines work in tandem. If one of its parts closes down, the rest also comes to a standstill. When the Mills shut down on June 10, 2015, it was not the result of any of its parts going out of order and gradually closing down the rest of the production process. Instead, all the plants and machines were shut down abruptly, at once.It was, however, not entirely unexpected. The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), that supplied natural gas to the Mills, had been demanding that its bills of nearly 35 billion rupees be cleared. After sending a final notice to the management of Pakistan Steel Mills early last summer, SSGC cut off the gas supply, bringing Pakistan\u2019s largest steel producer to a sudden halt.  An eerie silence surrounds Pakistan Steel Mills today. Its machines and plants \u2013 that have the capacity to produce close to 1.1 million tonnes of steel in a year \u2013 run the risk of becoming permanently dysfunctional if they do not start running again soon. The longer they remain turned off, the costlier it will be to reboot them. \n\nThe master plan for Karachi Steel Mill Township\n\n\nManagement officials at Pakistan Steel Mills are waiting for a miracle that sets it rolling again. \nThey are waiting for an injection of money from the federal government to pay outstanding salaries and other dues of former and working members of the staff. They are waiting for a missive from the Privatisation Commission. They were told that the financial adviser appointed by the commission to supervise the sale of the Mills to some private buyer would soon contact them. Many weeks have passed since that information reached them, but they have not received a single phone call or a letter with the latest updates. They are not even sure if privatisation will ever go ahead, at all. This \u2018nothing happens\u2019 state of affairs did not develop overnight. It has been almost 20 years in the making. On May 29, 1997, the Council of Common Interest (CCI) approved the Mills\u2019 privatisation because, according to a petition filed at the Supreme Court, \u201cit could not prove to be a commercially viable project\u201d. Immediately after the approval, however, the government started having second thoughts. It dropped the idea of privatisation and, instead, decided to reform the Mills\u2019 financial and management structures to make it profitable. The restructuring was made possible by hefty injections of money (secured by the government as loans). The move worked and the Mills started earning profit 2002 onwards. Also read: Gridlocked\u2014How power is lost in Pakistan's distribution linesAudited accounts confirm the improvement. In 1999-2000, the Mills made an annual loss of 1.141 billion rupees, taking its total accumulated losses to 9.326 billion rupees. By 2005, the accumulated losses were all gone. On the other hand, the Mills had an accumulated profit of 4.866 billion rupees.The production capacity also increased in that period: from 76 per cent in 1999-2000 to 86 per cent (in 2000-2001); 81 per cent (in 2001-2002); 92 per cent (in 2002-2003); 94 per cent (in 2003-2004) and 89 per cent (in 2004-2005). \nManagement officials at Pakistan Steel Mills are waiting for a miracle\nthat sets it rolling again.\nOn April 11, 2005, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation again decided to privatise Pakistan Steel Mills. In light of this decision, the government published newspaper advertisements, inviting Expressions of Interest from parties interested in acquiring the Mills. Sometime later, 19 parties applied, seeking approval for their qualification to partake in the privatisation process. These included Al-Tuwairqi Group (Saudi Arabia), in partnership with Arif Habib Group (Pakistan), and Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works (Russia). During this time, the government appointed Citi Group as the financial adviser to evaluate the assets of Pakistan Steel Mills. The adviser submitted its evaluation report to the Privatisation Commission, which deliberated upon it and also took into consideration the replacement cost of some of the machinery. The commission then suggested that the total worth of the Mills stood at 500 million dollars. \n\nA man makes his way down from one of the blast furnaces at Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nBased on this calculation, the price for 75 per cent stake in the Mills was put at 375 million dollars. Since one US dollar at the time was equal to 60 rupees, the price of a single share in local currency was calculated to be 17.43 rupees (the total number of shares being privatised was 1,290,487,275).When the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation went through these statistics, it revised the shared price downwards at 16.18 rupees. The Arif Habib Group and Al-Tuwairqi Group \u2013 two of the parties the government qualified to take part in the privatisation process \u2013 formed a consortium to offer a joint bid for the purchase of shares. Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works also joined the consortium on the day the bids were to be made. This consortium, according to the petition filed at the Supreme Court, offered to pay 16.80 rupees per share, a price higher than those offered by their competitors. The government accepted the offer and issued a letter of acceptance on March 31, 2006. The successful bidders signed an agreement with the government representatives on April 24, 2006. They were all set to take over the Mills. Except that it never happened.    Days before the letter of acceptance was issued, a little-known group, Wattan Party, and Peoples Workers Union (the elected trade union representative of the Mills\u2019 workers at the time) challenged the privatisation before the Sindh High Court in Karachi. The petition claimed that there were \u201comissions\u201d during the privatisation process and that the Mills was being sold at a \u201cthrowaway\u201d price of 21.68 billion rupees. Also read: Mass movement\u2014Karachi's public transport woesThe Sindh High Court referred the petition to the Supreme Court on March 30, 2006. The apex court examined the privatisation process over the next few weeks and declared the letter of acceptance as null and void on June 23, 2006. This was the first time, according to Mohammad Zubair, the current head of the Privatisation Commission, that the privatisation process of a government-owned entity was completed and then reversed by the Supreme Court. When Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, the chief justice of Pakistan at the time, took the decision against the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills, it seemed like a victory for the workers. Later, events would suggest that it was a pyrrhic one.Zubair says 2006 was the best time to privatise the Mills. Today, it is in the worst possible shape, he says, making its privatisation a very slow process, with little interest being shown by prospective buyers. The Mills, for instance, ran at only six per cent of its production capacity between 2013 and 2014. Its accumulated losses reached 118.529 billion rupees by the end of the 2013-2014 financial year. In that year alone, the Mills made a net loss of 23.532 billion rupees.\n\nA Soviet built machine at Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nThe rot started much before 2014. Many blame it on the way the federal government of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) \u2013 that came to power in the first half of 2008 \u2013 handled Pakistan Steel Mills. That year, the government appointed a new chairman, Moin Aftab Sheikh, to head the Mills\u2019 management. The same year, election for the Collective Bargaining Agency (CBA) \u2013 empowered to bargain with the management on the workers\u2019 behalf \u2013 were held. Peoples Workers Union, a labour organisation of the Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 workers affiliated to PPP, won that election. The combined impact of a PPP-appointed chairman and the victory of its affiliated union as CBA was far from benign. The two sides, instead of keeping an eye on each other as they ideally should, seemingly joined hands to the detriment of the Mills. The alleged collaboration between the chairman and the CBA has been recorded in a corruption case registered in 2010. The case was in \u201crespect of award of Canteen contract wherein it is alleged that Mr Moin Aftab Sheikh\u2026in connivance with other accused persons fraudulently scrapped the already floated tender.\u201d This, according to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), caused a loss of 81.041 million rupees. One of the co-accused in this case is Shamshad Qureshi, the chairman of the CBA. Even otherwise, Sheikh\u2019s tenure was extremely controversial. All kinds of allegations swirled around him. In 2009, a case was registered against him and three others for causing a loss of 49 million rupees to the Mills. He was alleged to have \u201cfraudulently manipulated a spot purchase of 50,000 [metric tonnes] of coal\u201d from Australia \u201con highly-inflated price and on extremely higher freight rates despite declining market rate.\u201d \nThe combined impact of a PPP-appointed chairman and the victory of its\naffiliated union as CBA was far from benign.\nThe same year, Sheikh, along with a few others, was booked in another case. This pertained to the \u201cmanipulation\u201d in the acceptance of 40,000 metric tonnes of metallurgical coke, which \u201carrived from China \u2026 without opening of [Letter of Credit] or obtaining necessary permission \u2026 on highly-inflated price and on extremely high freight rates resulting in loss of 1 billion rupees\u2026\u201d Again, in 2009, he was among those who had allegedly manipulated \u201c10 shipments of coal\u201d from Australia and Canada on a \u201chighly-inflated price and extremely high freight rates, causing loss of billions of rupees\u201d. In a case registered in 2010, Sheikh was among 13 individuals who had caused \u201cwrongful loss\u201d to the public exchequer \u201cto the tune of millions of rupees regarding the sale and purchase of various finished products, including billets\". A 2012 case accused him and 26 others of collusion that \u201ccaused wrongful loss\u201d to Pakistan Steel Mills in \u201csale/purchase of various finished products\u201d.  Sheikh\u2019s alleged involvement in large-scale corruption also allowed his subordinates to pocket public money at will. In one of the four other major cases of corruption pertaining to his tenure, the senior management staff at the Mills caused a loss of 3.65 billion rupees by selling 49,000 metric tonnes of steel billets below market prices. In the second case, senior members of the management \u201cextended illegal benefit of 90 days free credit without mark-up to Amrelli Steels Limited\u201d in Karachi. The third one was regarding the violation of Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 rules (which state that the same company cannot be a trader and a consumer dealer) by two traders who, in connivance with the Mills\u2019 management, sold products they had purchased as consumer dealers in the open market. The last case makes the same allegation against the representatives of Gujrat Steel Private Limited who sold products they had purchased from Pakistan Steel Mills for four of their registered consumers. Their main accomplice from among the management was one Ghafoor Pathan,  who worked as deputy manager of Customer Service Marketing at the time. \n\nPakistan Steel Mills workers head home after their day shift\n\n\nThese cases were registered after the Supreme Court took suo motu notice of the allegations of corruption at Pakistan Steel Mills. The court directed the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to investigate those allegations. The public furor over stories of corruption in the Mills led the then Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to sack Sheikh on August 18, 2009. Those responsible for investigating plunder at Pakistan Steel Mills, however, have failed to move briskly enough to ensure the prosecution and conviction of those involved. Three years after the Supreme Court gave the FIA the task of investigation, the judges became unhappy with the agency\u2019s progress. \u201cWe do not find any serious effort on the part of the FIA towards prosecution of the cases,\u201d they declared. In 2012, they handed over the investigation to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which, too, has failed to achieve any results. While forwarding the cases to the NAB, the Supreme Court had ordered it to take action within three months. More than three years later, that order exists more in disregard than in compliance. In June of this year, the Ministry of Industries and Production in Islamabad sent a letter to the NAB, calling for the \u201clatest/updated compliance report for the cases \u2026 pending with NAB.\u201d The letter has elicited no response so far. Even when anti-corruption institutions have failed to bring the corrupt to justice, the data vividly paints the disaster their activities wreaked on the Mills. In the financial years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, it was running at a capacity of 82 per cent and 89 per cent, respectively. Its net annual profit stood at 3.159 billion rupees in 2006-2007 and at 2.081 billion rupees in 2007-2008. In the following year, there was a massive reduction in its production capacity, which fell to 65 per cent. The Mills incurred a loss of 26.526 billion rupees in 2008-2009. \nWhile forwarding the cases to the NAB, the Supreme Court had ordered\nit to take action within three months. More than three years later,\nthat order exists more in disregard than in compliance.\nAvais Hyder Liaquat Nauman, an audit firm that the Mills\u2019 management engaged on the orders of the Supreme Court to gauge the impact of Sheikh\u2019s tenure, made startling revelations: Pakistan Steel Mills suffered a loss of 9.99 billion rupees due to corrupt practices in that year; mismanagement and negligence caused a loss of 11.84 billion rupees; and business losses stood at 4.68 billion rupees. If Pakistan Steel Mills had not lost those 26.526 billion rupees under Sheikh, that money could have been sufficient to pay around 2.04 million rupees to each of the Mills\u2019 13,000 employees awaiting salaries. But even after Sheikh had left, the situation at the Mills went from bad to worse. Between August 2009 and July 2013, five people successively served as chairman of Pakistan Steel Mills \u2014 three of them held that position only in an acting position or as an additional charge. That, obviously, had a negative impact on the working of the Mills.In 2009-2010, its production capacity dropped to 40 per cent; in 2010-2011, it fell further to 36 per cent. By the end of 2012-2013, it had dipped to as low as 14 per cent. The Mills\u2019 accumulated losses at the time stood at a massive 94.997 billion rupees. In a span of only six years, between 2007 and 2013, the Mills not only eroded its previously accumulated profit of 9.536 billion rupees, but also added almost 10 times as much money in losses. That means that the total money Pakistan Steel Mills lost in this period stood at a staggering 104.533 billion rupees. With that kind of money, one can buy 5,226 two-bedroom apartments in a posh neighbourhood in Karachi, each costing 20 million rupees. \n\nThe iron making department inside Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif decided to resume the process of Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 privatisation in October 2013. It was included among 69 state-owned enterprises that the government wanted to sell to the private sector. Over the next three years or so, however, the Mills\u2019 privatisation made little progress. There were hurdles at every stage. Even the task of finding a financial adviser was not smooth. When the Privatisation Commission advertised in the press that it needed a financial adviser for the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills, no one came forward in the 30-day time frame given in the advert.The Privatisation Commission issued another ad after three months or so. Finally, towards the end of 2014, one consortium \u2013 comprising the Pak-China Investment Bank, the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and human resource consultancy Abacus \u2013 came forward. Even though the consortium is not the best adviser that the Mills should get, the commission \u2013 according to Zubair \u2013 had no choice. Another challenge for the Privatisation Commission was to make the Mills an attractive business for prospective buyers. Zubair decided to ask the federal government to inject 18.5 billion rupees into the Mills to improve its operational and financial status.When he took his plan to the Economic Coordination Committee of the federal cabinet in April 2014, he explained that his goal was to raise the production capacity from zero to 60 per cent (estimated to cost nine billion rupees) and pay the long-overdue utility bills and outstanding staff salaries (estimated to cost 9.5 billion rupees). His objective was to keep the Mills in working condition until the privatisation process was completed. The committee approved his plan.\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif decided to resume the process of Pakistan\nSteel Mills\u2019 privatisation in October 2013.\nIt also worked \u2014 at least initially. The production capacity did pick up and reached close to 60 per cent by early 2015.A few weeks later, came the biggest hurdle: disconnection of the gas supply shut down the Mills completely. Zubair and his Privatisation Commission have been unable to overcome that hurdle so far.He took another route to bypass it. The Privatisation Commission organised roadshows in September 2015 in Beijing and Shanghai to attract foreign buyers for Pakistan Steel Mills. Many Chinese companies showed conditional interest. The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation also approved the structure of the privatisation transaction on October 1, 2015, showing what assets were to be privatised and how many liabilities were to be transferred to the private buyer. While these developments were taking place, the government of Sindh showed interest in acquiring Pakistan Steel Mills. The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation directed the Privatization Commission to formally approach the provincial government to see if it was interested in acquiring the Mills with all its assets and liabilities. By the end of April 2016, the Sindh government said it was no longer interested. It said the federal government was not willing to provide even those financial incentives that any private buyer would have gotten anyway. A report published in the daily Business Recorder said that the Sindh government had sought financial assistance from the federal government, but the latter denied that request and told the former to buy the Mills on an \u201cas is, where is\u201d basis. For the next few months, the privatisation process was completely stalled. In June this year, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation again authorised the Privatisation Commission to restart the process. A meeting was held in Islamabad on September 21, 2016, to finalise a new transaction structure. \u201cWe will go back to the cabinet committee for the approval of [the] transaction structure in a couple of weeks,\u201d says Zubair. Also read: Harvesting losses- Behind the trouble on Punjab's rice farmsThat approval will face many roadblocks. Firstly, losses are piling up, and so are the liabilities. Secondly, Zubair says, the interest shown by Chinese companies is no longer as strong as it was last year, when eight of them were ready to take part in the privatisation process. Now,  only three to four of them are willing to do so. Thirdly, frustration among the employees of Pakistan Steel Mills is growing by the day over non-payment of their salaries and other dues. They want to get their money back before the Mills is privatised. Zubair knows all this. Even the highest bid will be nothing compared to what was offered in 2006, he says. \u201c[The Mills] is non-functional and it owes 66 billion rupees to the National Bank of Pakistan and 40 billion rupees to the Sui Southern Gas Company,\u201d he says. Whoever buys the Mills, their ability to borrow money from banks will be limited because of this credit history, he adds. Zubair also argues it will be a wise move to sell the Mills at whatever price it attracts. That will, at least, ensure the resumption of its operations, he says. The first benefit of an operational Mills will be that money being given to it as a subsidy from the public exchequer will no longer be required. Secondly, the new owners will invest money to upgrade plants and machines. Thirdly, an operational Mills will absorb 8,000 to 9,000 of its existing employees, if not all of them. \u201cWe will at least save it from complete shut down,\u201d Zubair says, considering the government does not have the resources to restart its operations.  \n\nThe coke oven plant inside Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nPakistan Steel Mills has not paid salaries to its staffers since May 2016. It has not paid gratuity to its former employees who have retired since May 2013 and it has failed to give provident fund to retiring staffers since 2015 (the total number of employees in these two categories is 3,000, according to a trade unionist). The Mills\u2019 total losses and liabilities, according to one source, stand at 400 billion rupees. Its management acknowledges it is losing seven million rupees per day, even when all its plants and machines are shut down and its staffers are not being paid. The Mills\u2019 accumulated losses and liabilities are more than 150 per cent of the total expenditure on setting it up back in 1974. That expenditure was recorded at 25 billion rupees. That money is equivalent to 2.52 billion dollars (considering that the dollar was equivalent to 9.9 rupees in 1974). In today\u2019s dollar prices, the Mills\u2019 construction cost would be 264.6 billion rupees even by conservative estimates. Back in the day, Pakistan Steel Mills was the \u201cbackbone of the nation\u201d. At its official inauguration ceremony on January 15, 1985, General Ziaul Haq said it was \u201cthe greatest and most precious new year gift to the nation\u201d. Lieutenant General Saeed Qadir, then federal minister for production, declared the Mills as a \u201cmilestone on the road of economic freedom, all-around progress and national honour\u201d. Also read: Ziaul Haq\u2014Master of illusionAt the ceremony, Vitali S Smirnov, the Soviet Union\u2019s ambassador to Pakistan at the time, said that the Mills would become a symbol of friendship between the two states. The entire funding for setting up the Mills came from the Soviet Union \u2014 some in the form of cash for constructing the buildings, roads, railtracks, conveyor belts, etc, and the rest in the form of finished products. After the ceremony, Haq spoke to reporters and claimed that the Soviet Union had offered to set up a second steel mill in Pakistan. \u201cWe welcome this gesture and will consider it at the right time,\u201d he said. The irony is that Pakistan, at the time, was also waging a proxy war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. \n\nMetal scrap at the scrapyard inside Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nSometime in the 1950s, Ghulam Faruque, a senior bureaucrat, established the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) with the objective of promoting industrialisation, both in the public and private sectors. His corporations would arrange money and technology for prospective investors. One of its earlier projects was building a steel mill because it was considered essential for the industrialisation of the country, says Haq Nawaz Akhtar, one of the first chairmen of Pakistan Steel Mills. The project was first proposed in the first five-year plan (1955 -1960), according to the Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 website. By 1956, Pakistan had received a proposal from the Soviet Union, offering technical and economic assistance to build the proposed steel mill, says a report by the Area Study Centre, a university-based think tank in Peshawar. In April 1965, President Ayub Khan visited Moscow. Subsequently, his government decided to set up a steel mill in the public sector. By July 2, 1968, reads an entry on the Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 website, \u201cPakistan Steel Mills Corporation was set up as a \u2026 company in the public sector in accordance [with] the Companies Act of 1913, with the objective to establish and run steel mills [in] Karachi and other parts of Pakistan.\u201d The following year in January, the corporation finalised an agreement with Tiajproexport, a company in the Soviet Union, \u201cfor the preparation of a feasibility report into the establishment\u201d of a steel mill. \nA couple of months later, Ayub Khan had to resign. \nThe interest shown by Chinese companies is no longer as strong as it\nwas last year, when eight of them were ready to take part in the\nprivatisation process.\nWhen Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became prime minister, he decided to set up the steel mill at its current location. He also approved the construction of Port Muhammad Bin Qasim, dedicated to fulfil the proposed mills\u2019 logistic requirements. Between 1972 and 1977, Bhutto visited Moscow twice. As pointed out by the Area Study Centre, there was an \u201cimprovement in economic and scientific relations\u201d between the two countries. In 1973, a number of Soviet economic delegations and steel experts visited Pakistan. On December 30 that year, Bhutto laid the foundation stone for Pakistan Steel Mills.  By the early 1990s, however, the Mills was already showing  signs of sluggish performance. Sabeeh Qamaruz Zaman was a serving lieutenant general at the time. He took over as the chairman of Pakistan Steel Mills in January 1992 and immediately embarked on a plan to cut costs. His first savings were in \u201covertime, incentive, medical, transport, financial expense and consumption of stores,\u201d according to a 1994 article written by defence and political analyst Ikram Sehgal and published in The Nation, a daily newspaper. Within 18 months of taking up his job, Zaman was able to bring down the total expenses from 223 million rupees to 165 million rupees per month. The medical expenses of employees would amount to 30 million rupees a month at the time, says a knowledgeable source. Some workers were applying for the reimbursement of their medical expenses, which were up to 25,000 rupees. Zaman set up a committee to address the issue: anyone who needed more than 5,000 rupees in medical expenses had to appear before the committee and justify the expense. The committee discovered that some employees were seeking reimbursement for money spent on cosmetics, house-building and repairing and other non-medical expenses. Within two months, the medical expenses dropped down to 10 million rupees.  \n\nSoviet built machinery at Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nAfter his retirement from the army, Zaman became one of the founding directors of The Citizens Foundation. He is now running a non-profit organisation for girls, Quality School Foundation, and lives a quiet life with his wife, children and grandchildren in Rawalpindi.Zaman managed to run the Mills in 1994, at its highest ever production capacity of 95 per cent, producing 1.04 million tonnes of steel in that year. In order to make that happen, he had to fight the unions, the Russian staff and even the government. He took on the Russians when they did not cooperate with him. After a Russian engineer declared a machine dead and demanded new machinery be bought from Russia, Zaman urged Pakistani engineers to rise up to the occasion and put the machine back to work. They passed the test with flying colours. He then told the Russian engineers to pack up and leave as they were no longer needed. Hundreds of them left as a result of his orders. These days only a handful of Russian engineers work at Pakistan Steel Mills. His next target were workers affiliated with political parties.  In the early 1990s, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) had 15 registered trade unions in Pakistan Steel Mills and a total of 600 labour activists. They considered themselves exempt from work, but got salaries and overtime regularly, along with other benefits, Sehgal wrote. Zaman also discovered that 3,800 of the Mills\u2019 employees existed only on paper. They never came to work. He immediately removed them from the payroll. It was later discovered that their salaries went directly to Nine Zero, MQM\u2019s headquarters in Karachi, says a source, without wanting to be named.  Incensed by his move, MQM threatened to close down the Mills as well as the city of Karachi. Under pressure from the party, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called Zaman for a meeting and tried to convince him to take those people back on the payroll. Zaman refused to undo what he had done. He told the prime minister that he could sack him if he liked. Sharif, instead, decided to form a committee to tackle the situation. Before this committee could even begin its work, the government started a security operation against MQM in Karachi. Zaman never had to worry about the issue any more. \u201cI stopped all outside interference by the labour unions, government and political parties,\u201d he says, in an interview conducted in his home. \u201cAll decisions were made in-house, in the interest of Pakistan Steel Mills and not in the interest of anybody outside,\u201d adds Zaman. \n\nAn employee sits in his two bedroom house inside Karachi Steel Mill Township\n\n\nNaureen Farooq remembers the good old days fondly. A native of Faisalabad, she joined Pakistan Steel Mills as a volunteer in its education department in 1985. The schools within the area where Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 workers lived were only up to the primary level at the time and were not in the best of conditions. In 1987, the management set up a committee to improve the quality of education. As recommended by the committee, the management gave full-time jobs to all those working as volunteers like Farooq. That gave a big fillip to educational activities.  Today, there are 21 educational institutions in the residential part of the Mills. These include primary schools, Sindhi medium schools, degree colleges and a cadet college. There are more than 5,000 children enrolled at these institutions. Farooq has albums containing photographs from her time as a teacher. In many of them, she can be seen standing confidently next to her colleagues and the Mills\u2019 management. Many pictures show annual school functions, stage performances by students, visits by Chinese delegations, sports events \u2014 and greener, brighter residential blocks. \u201cPeople keep complaining about what has happened to Pakistan Steel Mills,\u201d says Farooq, \u201cbut they never ask what part they have played in it.\u201d An industry does not reach point zero overnight, she adds.Farooq recalls how Muhammad Afzal, who worked as the Mills\u2019 chairman until his untimely death in 2003, once gathered all the employees of the education department and informed them that Pakistan Steel Mills was no longer running in losses. \u201cYou can proudly call yourselves the employees of Pakistan Steel Mills, because we have finally paid off all our debts,\u201d she quotes him as saying. \n\nThe Russian market inside Karachi Steel Mill Township\n\n\nInside Karachi Steel Mill Township, a residential neighbourhood built exclusively to house the Mills\u2019 staff, pride in the institution is the last thing one expects. Not a leaf rustles here on a suffocating August day. The streets that divide the workers\u2019 colony from the officers\u2019 residences are deserted \u2014 in tandem with the stillness at the nearby premises of the Mills. Built on approximately 715 acres of land, the township has 3,700 houses. It has its own schools, markets, recreational facilities, a dispensary, a mosque, a church and a temple. Many of the Mills\u2019 existing and former employees live here. The officers\u2019 residences that dot the streets all look the same: plain, concrete blocks with two floors, each marked by circular windows. Most have unkempt lawns. The paint on their walls is wearing off. In the workers\u2019 colony, houses are smaller. Some do not even have doors; curtains made of discarded bed sheets block off their entrances. The streets inside the colony look like they were abandoned years ago.  Public places and main roads in the township are a different affair. On one September evening, amateur footballers and cricketers from nearby areas are out  practicing their skills in the cricket grounds. The Mills\u2019 workers can also be seen there in the evening, returning home after finishing their day\u2019s work. Some of them take a stroll to Pakistani Market, a strip of grocery stores and teashops, to buy items of daily use; others gather at the nearby Russian Market, once meant to cater to the Russian employees of the Mills. \n\u201cPeople keep complaining about what has happened to Pakistan Steel\nMills,\u201d says Farooq, \u201cbut they never ask what part they have played in\nit.\u201d\nNow it is almost deserted, with just a few shops open. The proprietor of one of them has reportedly sold so many  groceries to the residents of the township on credit that his store appears abandoned, with empty shelves and a few items carelessly displayed.   According to some local residents, people in the township owe him as much as 5.5 million rupees. The sole reason why people are unable to pay him back is that they are no longer receiving their salaries and other dues as regularly as they should. Taj Begum knows what living without money is like. Inside the living area of her two-bedroom, single-storey house, her economic conditions are hard to disguise. A single couch bravely tries to fill space enough for a five-seat sofa set and its accompanying tables. It is time for the customary electricity outage. Begum\u2019s husband, Bashir Khan, is asleep, after having worked during the night shift at the Iron-Making Department. His job involves monitoring the casting process, which requires working right next to moulds that contain liquid iron with a surface temperature of nearly 1,200 degrees Celsius. These days, he spends seven hours at work, sitting with other workers and roaming around idle machinery.  Khan and Taj Begum have been married for nearly 30 years. They have seen better times. Taj Begum remembers the time when workers received their salaries as early as the 26th or 27th of the month, rather than waiting for the end of the month. And not just salaries \u2014 bonuses, too. Today, with no salary, she is finding it almost impossible to run her household. She has no money to send her four children to college and eventually marry them off. \n\nRetired employee of Pakistan Steel Mills, Shabbir Jumani, has been waiting for his provident fun and gratuity for nearly two years\n\n\nShe does not complain though and wonders out loud about the families of those workers who do not live in the township and, instead, reside in rented houses. Even when the workers get salaries, they do not know how much of it has been deducted in lieu of house rent and electricity bill because they are not being given their pay slips. Malik Waqas, a resident of the township and an employee of Pakistan Steel Mills, says his father\u2019s salary is around 65,000 rupees \u2014 but he received only 9,000 rupees the last time. The rest was deducted under various heads.Some workers complain that those living in two-bedroom houses are told that as much as 20,000 rupees have been deducted from their salaries as electricity bills. \u201cAn electricity bill of 21,000 rupees was deducted from the last salary I received,\u201d says Naimatullah, an employee of the Mills. Next month, the management again deducted the same amount as the price of electricity he had consumed. \u201cHalf of my salary is going into paying for electricity. I cannot pay this amount every month,\u201d he says.Shabbir Jumani, 63, cannot deal with such pecuniary anxieties. On the steps of the township\u2019s administration office, he breaks down.He joined the Mills in 1980 and retired in December 2014 as a machinist. \u201cI have not received a single penny after retirement,\u201d he says. He lowers his head every now and then, trying to hold back tears. Close to two years have passed, but he continues to wait for the receipt of his provident fund and gratuity. He does not know if he can get any other job. \u201cI am turned away from wherever I go looking for a job because I am too old to work,\u201d he says. Others complain that the Mills\u2019 management is failing to provide them health facilities at a time when they do not have the money to pay for them. Waqas, who has just returned from a visit to the Mills\u2019 hospital, sheds light on the healthcare facilities available to the workers. \u201cYou cannot even get an X-ray done there,\u201d he says. They have no syringes, no medicine; the doctors are there only to sign sick leaves. Health facilities are in a dire state mainly due to rampant corruption among the management. According to a recent story published in the daily Dawn, the FIA has found enough \u201cevidence\u201d against the senior management of Pakistan Steel Mills to prove that it was involved in misappropriating funds worth millions of rupees meant for procurement of medicine supplies. Medicine purchases were also \u201cmade from unregistered sellers of medicines and from \u2018freelancers\u2019 who were originally engaged in the supply of hardware, tools and general items\u201d to the Mills, the newspaper stated on October 1, 2016. \n\nImran Khan's stage at a protest in front of Pakistan Steel Mills, held on September 5, 2016\n\n\nA stage is being set in front of the Jinnah gate of Pakistan Steel Mills. Imran Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), is scheduled to arrive here to address the Mills\u2019 workers. Before his arrival, his party\u2019s activists grab as many PTI flags as they can and throw them towards the workers, waiting for Khan\u2019s arrival. Most of them are not PTI supporters. They, however, are here because they say Khan is at least showing up to express solidarity with them, unlike other political leaders who are least concerned about them. They are grateful to him. When Khan finally arrives, he does not speak to anyone and heads straight to the stage where he sits in a chair for a while as local leaders of his party and some of the Mills\u2019 workers deliver speeches. When his turn comes, he wastes little time in formalities and gets to the topic of Pakistan Steel Mills straight away. \u201cThis industry has been robbed,\u201d he says to a crowd of about 150 people. \u201cAnd those who have robbed it are residing as billionaires in big palaces.\u201d The crowd erupts in agreement and cheers him on. Khan continues: \u201cAnd who has paid the price for it? The workers of Pakistan Steel Mills.\u201dBetween his speech, some in the crowd chant \u201cGo Nawaz go\u201d, but their slogans are drowned by his voice blaring from the speakers. It is obvious that he knows very little about the Mills. \u201cToday, I am here with you because an industry that was making a profit of eight billion rupees in 2007 has been closed for five months.\u201d As he pauses, someone standing behind him tries to correct him \u2014 \u201cit has been closed 11 months,\u201d he says. Another person corrects him again. \u201cIt has been closed for 13 months,\u201d he intones.  \nIn the workers\u2019 colony, houses are smaller. Some do not even have\ndoors; curtains made of discarded bed sheets block off their\nentrances.\nFajar Ahmed, 62, is sitting among the audience. He is part of a labour organisation called the Insaf Workers Ittehad. It is not affiliated with PTI or any other party. It is just another group of workers, demanding their rights through a sit-in right next to the Mills\u2019 entrance. They have been protesting for close to two months now.  Ahmed has a large family \u2014 consisting of his wife, two sons, two daughters and his parents. He has worked at Pakistan Steel Mills for 26 years \u2014 first as a daily wage worker and, since 2010, as a regular employee. His job involves handling four different machines at the coke oven plant. He and others in his group took out a protest demonstration outside the Mills on August 3 this year. They marched from Pakistan Steel Mills to a nearby highway, demanding the release of their salaries, improvement in medical facilities and the clearance of post-retirement dues, among other things. The Mills\u2019 management did not bother to heed their demands. Instead, it sent show cause notices to all those workers who had participated in the protest, asking them to explain why they had marched on to the streets \u2014 as if everything was perfectly fine with the Mills and there was absolutely nothing to complain about.   It was perhaps under pressure from such protests that Finance Minister Ishaq Dar approved the payment of salaries for the months of April 2016 and May 2016, amounting to 760 million rupees, on September 7, 2016. He also approved the payment of gratuity and provident funds for some of the retired employees, amounting to 322.021 million rupees. \n\nWorkers of Pakistan Steel Mills protest on September 5, 2016\n\n\nIn the middle of last month, Ahmed and his fellow protesters are sitting in their sit-in camp. They are discussing problems that the workers and their families are facing. One of them says some shopkeepers around the Mills have placed signboards outside their shops telling Pakistan Steel Mills workers to stay away. The discussion then moves on to the role of the Peoples Workers Union: the CBA. A pamphlet issued by the Insaf Workers Ittehad gives details of the official vehicles being used by the CBA members \u2014 as well as the fuel and maintenance costs of those vehicles. According to a trade unionist, scrap stocked at a place called China Plant is being picked up illegally and sold at reduced prices. But what exactly is scrap? Since the Mills is not operational, it has tonnes of raw materials or half-finished products that cannot go into the next stage of production. These products are mostly in the form of metal slabs and rolled sheets kept outdoors in stockyards. Over time, rain and dew have corroded them, leaving them rusted and making them appear like scrap. Rehan Shah, a trade unionist and chairman of the Workers Welfare Trust, a non-profit organisation, recently wrote a letter to the Privatisation Commission after he came to know that the management of Pakistan Steel Mills had sought permission from the ministry of industries and production to sell those articles as \u2018scrap\u2019. When the management is given permission for the sale, it sells that \u2018scrap\u2019 to private buyers at the price of \u201cdust\u201d, he wrote. Since there is a history of selling scrap at extremely low rates, as Shah pointed out in his letter, it is likely that the raw material and half-finished products now lying around in the Mills can one day be sold in a similar way. \u201cThe sale of scrap is a form of corruption,\u201d Shah noted.\nAccording to a trade unionist, scrap stocked at a place called China\nPlant is being picked up illegally and sold at reduced prices.\nOther workers allege that a large racket is operating in the Mills to illegally transfer the raw material and unfinished products out of the Mills and then sell it at reduced rates. The workers say those involved in the theft take the materials out of the warehouses and leave them out in the open to rust. These are then loaded on to mini-trucks, which take them out of the Mills for sale. All of this, the workers allege, is taking place with the connivance of the CBA, the management and the security staff.These allegations are almost impossible to substantiate. Firstly, it is not easy to lift those very heavy articles without cranes and forklifts. Without a concerted activity by a good number of people and without the help of machines, loading them onto trucks that then take them out of the Mills\u2019 premises seems impossible. It must involve commotion at a scale that cannot go unnoticed. The management adds that the entrances and exits to the Mills are well-guarded and no vehicle can move in and out without official permission.   The account of at least two incidents of theft on a much smaller scale, though, can be found in a police record. On the morning of March 31 this year, various types of cable wires \u2013 including telephone cables and polyvinyl chloride wires used to make flexible tubing, upholstery and flooring \u2013 were stolen from two different stores located close to the Mills\u2019 transport department. Ikramuddin, son of Alauddin, an employee of Pakistan Steel Mills, had a police report registered about the theft on April 3, 2016,  at Bin Qasim Police Station, \u201con the direction of his senior officers\u201d. The length of the stolen wires was reported to be 2,370 metres for one type and 164 metres for the other. \n\nA dispensary inside Karachi Steel Mill Township\n\n\nRehan Shah has invited all the serving and recently retired employees of Pakistan Steel Mills to attend a court hearing on September 2, 2016. He filed a petition at the Sindh High Court on March 18, 2015, for the payment of staff salaries. \u201cIt is mandatory for all employees to be present at the Sindh High Court at 8 am,\u201d reads the text message that he has sent around. Nobody shows up, except one former employee: Muhammad Akram. Shah is agitated. With a file full of documents in one hand and his phone in the other, he is nervously walking in and out of the courtroom. The rest of the workers, Shah tells me, are getting on the buses and will soon be heading to the court. His hopes do not materialise.  Shah is known among the workers as Comrade Rehan. A soft-spoken, simple and unassuming man, he began to fight for the rights of labourers when he joined Pakistan Steel Mills in 1993 as a junior assistant. He initially worked in the accounts department, but once the management discovered his union activities, it transferred him to the coke oven plant. When you work there, he says, the black dust from the coal is so thick around you that it covers your entire body. When the Mills had been operational, the coke plant could generate enough electricity to pay off the salaries of all the workers, he claims. And not just electricity, Shah says, but three different types of gases that then help run the thermal power plant. (That plant once generated 165 megawatts of electricity. After fulfilling the Mills\u2019 needs, the management would sell the surplus for distribution in other localities.) Shah\u2019s transfer did not stop him from doing what he had been doing. New employees were hired at the time and Shah discovered that they were not receiving any hazard benefits. He helped all of them fill in a form to claim those benefits. That is how he came to be known as Comrade Rehan. From then on, Shah stepped in where and when workers\u2019 rights were being compromised. He has received 20 show cause notices for his activism, he tells the Herald, laughing. \n\nInside the iron making department of Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nSince Rehan filed his petition, there have been about half a dozen hearings. There has been no substantial progress in the case though. As the judges rise to leave for Friday prayers at 12:30 pm on September 2, Shah and his lawyer, Nadeem Shaikh, go to their desk and plead for a hearing. This is a matter of life and death for 13,000 employees of Pakistan Steel Mills who have not been receiving their salaries, Shaikh quickly tells the judges (who are scheduled to hear over 30 other cases that day). The judges listen to him briefly and give him the date for the next hearing: September 21. On that day, too, no more than two workers join Shah at the court. The judges hear the case for a few minutes and adjourn it to October 25. The only development that day: the court summons the Mills\u2019 chief executive officer (CEO) to be present at the next hearing. That will only start substantial proceedings \u2014 provided the CEO turns up. How many more hearings will the court take before it issues a verdict is anyone\u2019s guess. And it is not certain if the verdict will be in the favour of the workers. The vague promise of the petition\u2019s outcome inspires no one back at the Mills. More importantly, the machines will not whir, the plants will not hum, the furnaces will not radiate \u2014 even if the judges decide the case tomorrow. \nShamshad Qureshi, Chairman of the Peoples Workers Union (CBA), Pakistan Steel Mills, responded to the story after it was published, in a letter to the Herald. Here is the edited version of his reponse:This refers to the article \u201cBurnt Out: The demise of Pakistan Steel Mills\u201d, that appeared in the Herald\u2019s October 2016 issue. The article stated that I was accused in the Pakistan Steel Mills canteen case, which is incorrect. The reporter never contacted me or took my point of view and made allegations against me that are totally baseless and untrue. As CBA chairman, I have no role to play in the award of a canteen tender. I was never implicated or nominated in the First Information Report (FIR) as mentioned in the article. Peoples Workers Union won the 2008 referendum, held under the supervision of NIRC, with a substantial margin. The registration of all seven of its opposing unions was cancelled by the government.To imply that PPP appointed Chairman and CBA is in any way responsible for decline in performance of the Mills is incorrect. It is the job of the federal government to appoint the management of steel mills and monitor their performance.  The chairman was sacked on corruption charges by the then Prime Minister at the floor of National Assembly on 18-8-2009; the case was then directed to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for further investigation. Peoples Workers Union won the referendum for a third time in a row in November 2013 during the tenure of the present PML-N government. This proves the confidence of the workers in the union.\nThis article was originally published in the Herald's October 2016 issue.

The shipment, an Indian gift for Afghanistan, was sent from the western seaport of Kandla. It will be taken by trucks to Afghanistan from the Iranian port. The new trade route follows an air freight corridor introduced between India and Afghanistan in June last year to provide greater access for Afghan goods to the Indian market. In his new Afghanistan strategy unveiled in August, US President Donald Trump asked India to do more to help Afghanistan\u2019s development. Pakistan currently does not allow India to transport goods through its territory to Afghanistan because of hostility in their ties. It sees no role by India in Afghanistan. Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said on Sunday the shipment marked the convergence among India, Afghanistan and Iran to spur an unhindered flow of commerce and trade throughout the region. \u201cI believe that this is the starting point of our journey to realise the full spectrum of connectivity from culture to commerce, from traditions to technology, from investments to IT, from services to strategy and from people to politics,\u201d Ms Swaraj said.

The Israelis were not much interested in accepting a ceasefire set to begin the previous day, and, according to Anatoly Chernyaev, a Soviet official present at the talks, Brezhnev wanted to encourage the Israelis to keep the truce by offering a Soviet guarantee of Israel\u2019s borders. Gromyko replied that the Arabs would take offence \u2014 but Brezhnev burst out that \u201cwe have been offering them [the Arabs] a sensible course of action for so many years. They wanted war and they are welcome to it \u2026 To hell with them.\u201dIt was a view long shared by Soviet military officers. I recall the remaining anger of a former Soviet instructor in Yemen during the 1962-70 civil war, who, showing me Red Square one cold afternoon, made a remark almost as contemptuous as Brezhnev\u2019s. \u201cWe helped to train the Arabs [against the monarchists] and they were useless and I think they should be on their own. Let someone else save them. Why should it be us all over again?\u201dIn October 1973, Brezhnev was saying the same thing. He swore at Gromyko, said Chernyaev, for \u201cwanting to keep our flag and bases in the Middle East\u201d. And Brezhnev then shouted out: \u201cWe will not let these .... people involve us in a world war!\u201d According to author and former British intelligence official Gordon Barrass, who wrote one of the best books on the Cold War eight years ago, the Soviet airlift of military equipment to Syria stopped that very day.How lucky now are the Arab potentates and dictators to have a Russian rather than a Soviet to talk to, and a fit \u2014 some might say almost too fit \u2014 Vladimir Putin to rely on, rather than a Brezhnev. A vacillating Obama and a lunatic Trump, of course, do the impossible: they make Putin look like a Roosevelt or an Eisenhower \u2014 perhaps even the swashbuckling Theodore Roosevelt with his Rough Riders.Putin\u2019s Rough Riders in Syria are crushing the militant Islamic State group threat \u2014 and any other threat \u2014 for Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government. The Russians are not just bombing Assad\u2019s enemies and re-arming the Syrian army but helping to arrange ceasefires. I watched them escorting al-Nusra and other still-armed Islamist fighters from Homs all the way to the Turkish front line at al-Bab (inside Syria). Russian armoured vehicles stood on both sides of that line this year \u2014 I saw them with my own eyes \u2014 alongside both Syrian and Turkish occupation troops.Putin has learned a few tricks from the Brezhnev days. Just as the bankrupt Soviet president put Tajik Muslim Soviet military units into bases west of Kabul, so Putin has deployed Chechen Muslim Russian soldiers into Palmyra. But these Russians are not the Soviets of Afghanistan infamy. Many of the officers speak fluent Arabic (and, please note, pretty good English). Putin knows how to measure Russian power in the Middle East, happy to keep Moscow\u2019s \u201cflag and bases\u201d in the region. And playing Bismark across the Arab world, even in Turkey and Israel.Egypt\u2019s field marshal/president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took Putin to a Verdi performance in Cairo. Iran will host him before the end of this year. Putin welcomes both Assad loyalists and Syrian rebels to Astana. He invites both Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and his racist (and Soviet-born) defence minister Lieberman \u2014 who once advocated drowning Palestinian prisoners in the Dead Sea \u2014 to the Kremlin. And of course, he won the cachet of a visit from King Salman of Saudi Arabia to the Kremlin.Undemocratic, brutally suppressing his own internal political opponents, hateful of all Muslim extremists \u2014 he suggested that Moscow doctors could emasculate them \u2014 careless of what others say of his air force\u2019s bombing in Syria and we must not forget Ukraine and Crimea and Western sanctions, in the Middle East he can wear the mantle of an international statesman. It might all come to grief for Putin. Failing to foresee the outcome of his actions was regarded as his greatest fault when he was a KGB officer in Dresden. But he\u2019s been sending in groups of Russian military non-FSB intelligence men to Syria, some of them \u2014 in Aleppo \u2014 reporting directly to the Kremlin. Maybe he has learned a thing or two.And so we come back to King Salman\u2019s visit to Moscow. Here is a man whose kingdom maintains the same purist Wahhabi faith which inspires IS and the Taliban and Al Qaeda. He signed preliminary agreements to buy Russia\u2019s S-400 air defence missile systems. Of course, the king\u2019s long speech \u2014 he enjoyed his Kremlin banquet, they say \u2014 talked about the necessity of preventing Iran\u2019s destabilisation of the Middle East. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said Russia \u201csupports the efforts of the Saudi kingdom in trying to unify the Syrian opposition\u201d. Which particular opposition, one might like to know? So, I imagine, would Assad.Yet the king was, according to Russian officials in the Middle East, asked to participate in the rebuilding of Syria when its war finally peters out. Quite a role for King Salman if Assad \u2014 as all believe he will \u2014 remains the president (or in some similar role) in Syria. But of course, it would be Russia who does the rebuilding, Saudi Arabia who paid for it. So the two vast oil nations now seem to be set on a course of mutual collaboration. So much for Trump\u2019s $300 billion weapons deal with the King. Maybe Salman is smarter than we think. If Putin might, for Washington, be Ivan the Terrible, that\u2019s better than being Trump the Farcical for the Arabs.Putin knows the Saudi weaknesses; Riyadh\u2019s war in Yemen (not unlike the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan) and the attacks on the kingdom, not least the mysterious explosion outside the king\u2019s palace just before his visit to Moscow; after which the Saudi Press Agency admitted that three armed men had tried to enter the building. And beware, if the Saudis resist the Russian offer on Syria, Putin can always turn \u2014 and many there are in Syria who believe this \u2014 to Qatar, with which the Saudis still maintain their childish feud. The Saudis will remember how Putin encouraged an Islamic conference in Chechnya \u2014 but sent no invitations to Saudi clerics. Putin still keeps a Russian military base in the Caucasus \u2014 in formerly Soviet Armenia. The Armenian parliament has this month, quite unnoticed in the Western media, ratified a new military defence treaty with Russia. So, please note, Turkey \u2014 which still claims to \u201cprotect\u201d Turkish Azerbaijan against the \u201caggression\u201d of Armenia.And watch out to the Kurds south of Turkey\u2019s border (both the Syrian and Turkish variety), whose notional independence has received no support from Moscow. They will not be defended by Putin when the US betrays them again (Kurds having died in lieu of US ground troops in Raqa and Mosul). Putin knows who the major powers are. Yes, he would like to take over the pseudo-neutral peace-making role of the US in securing a Palestinian state but, as a Palestinian socialist (of whom few are left) says in Beirut, don\u2019t hold your breath. When Moscow agreed to sell Kornet anti-tank missiles to little Lebanon last month, Prime Minister Saad Hariri was apparently a bit stunned to be told that the Russians would not hand over the weapons on credit. Russian and Lebanese finance ministry officials are to discuss this matter. Readers will wait in vain for the outcome.Wearying clich\u00e9s about the Russian Bear or Putin the Fox \u2014 as he is actually called in Cairo \u2014 do no credit to any serious analysis of Russian behaviour in the Middle East. This is ruthless power politics, of course, only accentuated by Washington\u2019s inane and insane president. Everything must be in Russia\u2019s interest \u2014 militarily, economically, internationally and domestically. And amorally, too.But sometimes the Arabs \u2014 and the Iranians and the Turks, and the Israelis, too \u2014 must wonder if there is, here, just a little bit of Putin\u2019s own persona, the one he wants to show to the world: warrior, peacemaker, negotiator, friend of all who do not threaten Russia. And enemy of all those who do. Who will be the next, then, to offer Moscow another Russian air base or warm-water harbour, military facilities in the Mediterranean, even welcome Russian warships into Middle Eastern ports? And who will be the last to deny Putin?But he\u2019s not trying to solve the region\u2019s problems, whatever he may say. He\u2019s still taking risks, not least in Syria. To some extent he\u2019s playing with the people of the region. More importantly, however, he\u2019s establishing Russia in the Middle East. No one will do anything now without first thinking of Putin\u2019s reaction.

It comes as no reassurance, then, that while Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal insisted people would be allowed to air their political opinions on social media, he also announced that the FIA would spearhead the creation of a framework to monitor its use. There is a long history of politicians and dictators asserting that the state is being \u2018maligned\u2019 or \u2018belittled\u2019, and using this claim to crush dissent and enforce obsequience in both public and private realms. Given that his government passed the draconian Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, as a PML-N member Mr Iqbal bears some responsibility in this erosion of rights. And with all the baggage of his predecessor\u2019s tenure, the onus is squarely on him to assuage any misgivings of his ministry\u2019s intentions.To do so, rather than developing a framework to monitor social media, the existing framework of digital legislation ought to be critically examined, and Peca amended so that cybercrimes are strictly and narrowly defined. The IT experts and digital rights activists the minister wants to consult had made recommendations for Peca, but were sidelined; their advice must now be incorporated. As an investigative body, FIA has no jurisdiction to define what constitutes appropriate use of social media, and there should be severe limits on its ability to monitor citizens\u2019 online activities. True, emerging threats of \u2018fake news\u2019 and foreign attempts to influence elections, which the minister cited, require careful, transparent inquiry. But what is not needed is the securitisation of the one space where it is the people who wield power. Increasingly, we have seen their power affect real change; social media has helped topple dictators, brought corruption to light and exposed sexual predators. If this upsets the status quo, so be it \u2014 the people\u2019s reckoning has been a long time coming.

Some might recall that details from the LTP in question were published by Dawn in a long detailed report in May, and the same minister had reacted sharply at the time, saying that the details are \u201cfactually incorrect\u201d and the real plan will be made public once it has been finalised. It looks like that moment is at last arriving, if the minister lives up to his promise of releasing the full document. If they do what they did earlier in the year, and produce a shortened, sanitised and general summary of the main LTP, and release that claiming that it is the original document, we will know that an effort is being made to conceal the real details of CPEC from the public. To recap the conversations that took place around the time when the Dawn story revealed the details of the plan, there were four main areas of focus identified by the Chinese side and a few from the Pakistanis. The Chinese appeared primarily interested in agriculture, industrial zones and tourism, along with a digital strategy to expand fibre optic connectivity and build a submarine cable landing station in Gwadar to carry some of their digital traffic from the western provinces out via Pakistan rather than routing it through servers in Europe.\nCPEC is about preparing the country to receive massive amounts of Chinese investments, personnel and culture.\nIn addition, there was a detailed financial strategy, which called upon the government of Pakistan to expand the role of the yuan in its economy, turn more to raising debt from the markets in Hong Kong, and dedicate increasing resources from its own budget, as well as provincial and local bodies\u2019 budgets, towards CPEC-related priorities.Since then, we have seen something odd happening. Many of the priorities identified in the LTP have indeed been pursued since, but without any of the fanfare associated with the inauguration of roads and power plants. For example, the national food security policy announced in July contained an entire section dedicated to the creation of CPEC-related agriculture development zones as one solution to the country\u2019s future food security issues. Many of the details in that policy document sound almost identical to the priorities highlighted by the Chinese in their LTP document, produced by the China Development Bank under the auspices of the National Development Reform Commission.In other examples, a recent news item highlighted the fact that a Chinese company has entered into an MoU with the city of Karachi to build an elevated road, almost four kilometres long, from Clifton Beach to Hawkesbay. A closer read of the actual MoU shows that the road is in fact being built to carry traffic to a Chinese resort to be built in Hawkesbay beach, possibly one of the first of the many tourist resorts to be built along the coastal strip from Badin to Gwadar identified in the Dawn report.There are innumerable examples now. Land acquisition is under way in various areas around KP to build housing for Chinese personnel who will reside in the province in the years when CPEC-related investment begins pouring into the country. The basic point here is simple: we have all been led to believe that CPEC is about connectivity, roads and power plants. In reality, it is about much more than that. It is about preparing the country to receive massive amounts of Chinese investments, personnel and culture. None of this implies that CPEC is a bad thing, as some people are ready to conclude without reflection. It is only to imply that the real details of what is being negotiated under the CPEC umbrella need to be publicly known, and efforts to hide these details from the public in a democratic country like Pakistan, where transparency and debate around issues of national importance are the norm, are bound to fuel adverse commentary and conspiracy theorising.When the minister issued his sharp response to the Dawn story about the LTP, he was given a clear stage upon which to air his grievances with the story. When has asked for more time to be allowed to make the details of the LTP, he was given the time he said he required. But now that he has confirmed that the LTP is about to be finalised, it must be insisted that the time to deliver on his commitment has also arrived.It is worth bearing in mind a couple of tricks that the government could resort to in order to try and wiggle out of this commitment without appearing to do so. Early in the year, when it needed provincial government assent for the plan, it generated a shorter, edited draft of the original LTP and circulated that to the provincial governments. Later, the government tried to argue that the edited version is the real one, and the longer, detailed draft was only a \u201cworking document\u201d. A few people fell for this gimmick, thinking that somehow there are multiple drafts of the plan in play. In reality there was only one, and the shorter one was only a summary meant for public consumption with all vital details removed. Such gimmickry must not be resorted to this time. The LTP is one of the most important documents in the arena these days, far more than the LNG contract that members of the opposition parties are clamouring for access to. It is bewildering to see the same members of the opposition parties holding their silence regarding the disclosure of the LTP. How has the silence of the opposition parties been obtained? Have they seen the LTP to be satisfied that no further discussion is required? The demands for CPEC transparency are more consequential for Pakistan\u2019s long-term prospects, especially for its economy, and silence does not serve that interest well.

Iraqi forces shelled Kurdish military positions north and south of Altun Kupri, a town of about 9,000 people just outside the country's autonomous Kurdish region, a day after Brigadier Gen Raad Baddai gave warning he was going to enter the town. Organised Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, as well as irregular forces, responded with rocket fire. By mid-day, Iraq's defence ministry said anti-terrorism forces, the federal police and the country's Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Front (PMF) militias had taken the town. But the peshmerga's general command disputed that claim, saying Kurdish fighters fought off the advance and destroyed 10 Humvees and an Abrams tank. Ercuman Turkmen, a PMF commander, said from inside the town his forces were being targeted by sniper fire. Speaking to the AP by phone, he said he had no orders to enter the Kurdish autonomous region. There were no casualty reports but AP reporters saw ambulances outside the town. The boundaries of the country's Kurdish region have long been disputed between Baghdad and Irbil, the Kurdish capital, but Kurdish forces this week withdrew in most areas to positions they last held in 2014, effectively restoring the contours of the map to the time before the rise of the militant Islamic State (IS) group. They pulled out of nearby Kirkuk after brief clashes and handed over surrounding oil fields nearly without a fight, but they held on to Altun Kupri, making a symbolic last stand in front of the vastly more powerful Iraqi army. \u201cThe Kurdistan peshmerga forces have resisted heroically in this confrontation and have recorded a great honour,\u201d the peshmerga general command said in a statement released mid-day. Altun Kupri is the last town on the federal side of the border on the road between Kirkuk and Irbil. Kurdish forces entered Kirkuk in 2014 when Iraq's army melted away ahead of the Islamic IS' blitz across northern and western Iraq. The city, home to over one million Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen, emerged at the heart of the dispute over whether Kurdish authorities should return the territories it acquired during the war on IS. They have lost an important stream of oil revenues with the loss of the city, dealing a serious blow to aspirations for independence. Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani championed a non-binding vote for Kurdish independence in September. Baghdad condemned it and instead demanded the return of the disputed territories, precipitating the crisis. The peshmerga are vastly outmatched by Iraq's federal armed forces and the Iranian-sponsored militias that fight alongside them. Both the Kurds and the federal forces are accustomed to calling and receiving coalition air support as part of their shared war on the IS group. \u201cThere's nothing we can do about it, honestly. I'm urging the coalition forces to come and help us.\u201d said peshmerga fighter Ibrahim Mirza. \u201cNo doubt we have martyrs.\u201d Kurdish authorities sent reinforcements to the front lines. An AP team saw a convoy of dozens of armoured vehicles arriving at the Kurdish side of the front, and fighters waiting in the town of Kustepe, on the Kurdish side of the border. Thick black smoke rose from a checkpoint north of Altun Kupri after it was hit by a shell, and ambulances rushed from the front lines into Kurdish areas. Altun Kupri is 40 kilometres northwest of Kirkuk. \n", "title": "Kurdish forces clashes with Iraqi military after Kirkuk surrender", "author": "AP"}, "1363851": {"date": "October 15, 2017", "article": "\n\nBorn on Oct 17, 1817, Syed Ahmad bin Muttaqi Khan began his career in service of the East India Company. After the war of 1857 he started working for educational reforms for the Muslims of India. In 1888 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India and became known as Sir Syed Ahmad Khan\n\n\nSir Syed Ahmad Khan emerged as a key leader of the Indian Muslim community in the aftermath of the War of Independence of 1857, as a thoroughly modern Muslim in a thoroughly pre-modern age. He is credited for originating the two-nation theory, founding the Aligarh Movement and being a founding father of Pakistan, but less celebrated are his achievements in providing a modern, scientific and rational interpretation of Islam and the Holy Quran, as well as his debates on culture that \u2014 in the face of stern opposition from fundamentalists and detractors \u2014 sowed the seeds of enlightenment and progress.  HIS VIEWS ON CULTURESir Syed was probably the first intellectual to present the meaning of culture as it was prevalent in the West in the 19th century. When defining the aims of his journal Tehzeeb-ul-Akhlaq in its first edition, he wrote: \u201cThe objective of issuing this journal is to persuade Indian Muslims to adopt a complete degree of civilisation, meaning culture, so that the hatred with which the civilised (cultured) nations view them should go away and they may also be said to be [one of the] exalted and cultured nations of the world.\u201d\nOctober 17 marks the bicentennial of the birth of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, who exerted a defining influence on Indian Muslim thought. It is instructive to understand how his thinking evolved and the \nstrong oppositions he faced during his time\nExpounding on this, he wrote two detailed essays in Tehzeeb-ul-Akhlaq, \u2018Culture and its Definition\u2019 and \u2018Civilisation or Sophistication and Culture\u2019, based on a book by British historian Thomas Buckle. Buckle had tried to write the history of human civilisation in the light of scientific knowledge and also fashioned a few \u2018laws\u2019 based on inductive reasoning; for example, the law of seasons, that showed that the physical environment greatly affected human culture. Although Buckle\u2019s \u2018ideologies\u2019 went against historical facts (the physical environment of the ancient Indus Valley, Nile River Valley and Mesopotamia was different from Europe, but no one can deny the greatness of these cultures), the West enthusiastically welcomed them because Buckle had fashioned the dominance of the white nations and slavery of Asian nations into a natural law, thus presenting an ideological justification for Britain\u2019s imperialist interests. What Sir Syed wrote about man and human culture 150 years ago continues to hold true. For example, he said, \u201cThere is a close relationship between human actions and the laws of nature,\u201d meaning that the laws of human society and the movement of nature are identical. Then, \u201chuman actions and the work of their mutual milieu are subject to some predetermined law and not coincidental.\u201d Third, \u201cMan\u2019s actions are not the results of his wishes, but the results of past events.\u201d Fourth, \u201cAny human society is not free of culture\u201d and fifth, \u201cMan changes nature and nature changes Man and all events are made from this mutual exchange.\u201dIn mentioning the specific qualities of man, Sir Syed wrote that man\u2019s \u201corgans and body are ... not his only superiority, but the work he is able to do with the help of his intelligence, as well as with such hands, because of them he is able to live a happy, comfortable life ... able to make his self into an artificial existence and, compared to the status of his natural life, is able to provide it with a lot of luxury.\u201d A comprehensive review of Sir Syed\u2019s intellectual services is beyond the scope of this essay. However, we must admit that he was the first Indian Muslim thinker to explain changes in the world and human society in terms of the laws of motion of society itself and its creation. He did not include the intent or desire of any supernatural force.\n\nA photocopy of the front page of the first issue of Tehzeeb-ul-Akhlaq, dated Shawwal 1, 1287 Hijri, corresponding to Dec 24, 1870 | Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nHIS OWN EVOLUTIONWhen Sir Syed was compiling the Aaeein-i-Akbari in 1848, and later when he was writing Asar-us-Sanadid, Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib wrote asking what was of worth in the ancient texts. He desired to know why Sir Syed was engaged in nourishing the dead. He demanded Sir Syed to come out of worshipping the past and see the amazing scientific inventions the savants of the West had pioneered, such as the steam-powered ship and other machines, the electric wire, the matchstick and \u2014 even greater than these \u2014 a code, a law and a system. \u201cPut aside the Aaeein, and parley with me/ Open thine eyes in this old world/ And examine the life of the Englishmen/ Their style, their manner, their trade and their art,\u201d wrote Ghalib, greatly upsetting Sir Syed. Yet 20 years later, the very same Sir Syed set up the Scientific Society of Aligarh, earning the epithets of kafir and zindiq from representatives of the ancient ruins. This internal intellectual revolution was caused by the Western-style administration, lifestyle and education; had Western influence not been so dominant, perhaps Sir Syed would still be engaged with the ancient ruins.One of Sir Syed\u2019s ardent disciples, Maulana Altaf Hussain Hali, wrote in Hayat-i-Javed, his biography of the former, that at a time when Raja Ram Mohan Roy was demanding the English language and modern education, the Muslim ulema, by means of 8,000 signatures, proclaimed that the new infidel education was not needed; teaching Farsi and Arabic was enough. Sir Syed expressed his embarrassment at this organising of Muslims against modern education in which religious scholars played a prominent role. Sir Syed viewed the intellectual changes taking place at a level further than Ghalib. He understood that without engaging in the new form of scientific education, Indian Muslims would not only be left far behind, but might not even be able to maintain their identity. When he set up the Scientific Society \u2014 the basis of which was rationalist, or using reason \u2014 he was denounced as an Anglophile and an apologist for the colonial masters. From the fundamentalists came fatwas, while the nationalists called him a lackey who, in his passion for adopting new visions, had become an ally and propagandist of the British government.This objection was, to a great extent, true. Sir Syed was politically conservative, believing that India\u2019s security lay in British rule and instead of reconciling himself with India\u2019s national aspirations, he saw Muslims as a separate nation. But from a social perspective he was progressive. He ran a proper campaign to organise views in favour of modern ideas and against the worship of superstition. His own viewpoint had changed; from his 1848 essay Qaul-i-Mateen Dar Abtaal Harkat-i-Zameen in which he tried to refute the theory of the movement of the earth, his thought had adopted a scientific turn.In religion, his basic inference was that there could not be a contradiction in the Word and Work of God. He meant that nature could not be against the Word of God and if it appeared to us as such, we were definitely making a mistake somewhere in understanding the Word. That was why we needed to have commentary and exegeses of the Word of God on new lines.\n\nThe Muhammadan Anglo Oriental College was founded in 1877 as one of India\u2019s earliest residential educational institutions. It was affiliated first with the University of Calcutta and then with the University of Allahabad. By 1920 the college had grown and expanded into the Aligarh Muslim University | Dawn file photo\n\n\nConsequently, Sir Syed emphasised a new education of the Word (ilm-ul-kalaam). He opened educational institutions and schools, but \u2014 in what could be considered a flaw \u2014 kept Cambridge and Oxford as his models and gave the leadership of his institutions to the British. As a result, his policy for educational institutions was limited to being openly patronising of the British, which was undoubtedly a great defect in his scheme. But all this was part of his political thought. The second major flaw in Sir Syed\u2019s educational scheme was that he did not pay attention to the teaching of industry, handicrafts and technology, although a nation cannot progress economically without technical education. Until the 1930s and 1940s there was no arrangement at Aligarh for the teaching of technology, engineering and medicine. Even so, Sir Syed\u2019s role in our cultural and intellectual history has been undeniably unique. As for him being a British loyalist, that objection is not really significant anymore because he turned our intellectual current towards scientific thought, liberating us from a worship of superstition and religious preconceptions. His personality and intellectual steadfastness drew groups of enlightened people round him \u2014 even today we refer to them as the Sir Syed School. The man proved to be much more than an individual; he was a movement unto himself. OPPOSITIONIt has been observed above that Sir Syed was politically conservative and socially progressive. But the movement he started also had both political and social effects that led to reactions both against and in favour of the former. In the literary domain there was a notable reaction against him, for example, from the Lucknow school that included Pandit Ratan Nath Sarshar and Munshi Sajjad Hussain and which supported old values. The whole Awadh Punch group disfavoured him and his comrades. Some detractors composed poems calling him a new prophet of naturism: \u201cHe [Sir Syed] is the messenger of \u2018natural religion\u2019/ This natural religion was indeed \u2018revealed\u2019 to him/ He alone knows the secrets of the Book, because/ All the esoteric knowledge has been vouchsafed to him/ The evidence of his prophethood is visible to all/ It is visible in the pages of his Tahzeeb-ul-Akhlaq.\u201dOther notable opponents were the distinguished Pan-Islamist thinker and activist Jamaluddin Afghani and the eminent humorous Urdu poet Akbar Allahabadi. According to Allahabadi: \u201cWhat our respected Syed says is good/ Akbar agrees that it is sound and fair/ But most of those who head this modern school/ Neither believe in God, nor yet in prayer/ They say they do, but it is plain to see/ What they believe in is the powers that be.\u201dOne of Sir Syed\u2019s disciples, Deputy Nazeer Ahmad, bitterly satirised his mentor in the novel Ibn-ul-Waqt [The Opportunist]. Another disciple, Shibli Nomani, abandoned his mentor and founded another institution, the Dar-ul-Uloom Nadwa. Much was written against Hali\u2019s Muqqadima-i- Sher-o-Shairi that, \u201cit is trampled like the field of Panipat.\u201d Writers and poets split into two distinct groups, one favouring enlightened, progressive thought while the other favoured obscurantist and past-worshipping ideas. As the noted Urdu poet Ehsan Danish observed in his tribute, Sir Syed Ki Ruh Se [To Sir Syed\u2019s Spirit]: \u201cWhat was lit by the sparks within your chest/ That secretly burning fire could not grow cold until now/ Your foresight has granted lamps to the future/ Despite which the air is polluted by the smoke of the past until now.\u201d*All translations from the original Urdu are by Raza NaeemThe writer is president of the Progressive Writers Association in Lahore, a social scientist, book critic and award-winning translator and dramatic readerPublished in Dawn, Books & Authors, October 15th, 2017\n", "title": "ESSAY: THE MAN WHO BECAME A MOVEMENT", "author": "Raza Naeem"}, "1367564": {"date": "November 01, 2017", "article": "TOKYO: More than 200 people are feared to have died when a tunnel caved in at North Korea\u2019s nuclear test site after its latest detonation, a Japanese news report said on Tuesday.A tunnel collapsed at Punggye-ri in early September, days after North Korea conducted its sixth and largest underground nuclear test on Sept 3, TV Asahi said, quoting unnamed North Korean sources.Some 100 workers were involved in an initial collapse. Another cave-in occurred during rescue operations, leaving at least 200 people feared dead in total, the Japanese broadcaster said.The accident was triggered by the test, TV Asahi added.Experts have warned that the underground tests could cause the mountain to collapse and leak radiation into the atmosphere near China\u2019s border.

And despite my recent lament about the shoddy way too many theaters seem content to display the movies they\u2019re showing to an extent that were it not for professional obligations, I would avoid theaters entirely, I still believe in the theatrical experience.Even in these dark days, the theatrical experience can still be revelatory. Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dunkirk, for instance, was a movie made to be seen in cinemas \u2014 its crystal clear images blown up to the biggest size possible, its bone-rattling bombing runs inspiring involuntary flinches of terror. Blade Runner 2049 is another example of a movie that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where its stunning vistas and complicated sound design can be seen and heard most effectively.But making sure that experience is good for everyone can be tricky. Warner Bros domestic distribution president Jeff Goldstein emphasised that when I asked him about the challenges involved with showing Dunkirk, a film distributed in six different projection formats, including actual celluloid in 70mm, which is relatively rare but allows the filmmaker to capture more detail in each frame.\u201cSo, the population of film projectors is really low. Most of those projectors have been taken out of theaters and replaced with digital equipment, either 2K, 4K or better equipment. The niche locations that have film are few and far between. So what was interesting, just from an operational point of view, was to figure out how to do this,\u201d Goldstein said. Theatre operators, perhaps recognising the opportunity Dunkirk presented to get casual filmgoers back in theaters, stepped up to the challenge.\nGoing to the movies ought to be special \u2014 here\u2019s how theatres can make that happen\n\u201cI have to say that exhibition embraced Chris and Warner Brothers in a really proactive and special way and said, \u2018OK, tell us how to do it. We don\u2019t have projectionists anymore .... In many cases, we don\u2019t have equipment or if we have equipment ... we don\u2019t know how to operate it and, quite frankly, it needs maintenance,\u2019\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s all sorts of different issues that were involved, and we figured out logistically and operationally how you get in there and bring all the equipment up to speed, and then how do you operate it. So we provided projectionists in a lot of locations. We help train projectionists, and we used outside vendors who specialise in this very narrow field.\u201dGoldstein repeatedly highlighted the importance to Warner Bros of showing Dunkirk in the way that best shows off Nolan\u2019s vision as a filmmaker \u2014 a key concern for studios who remain committed to theatrical distribution even as streaming increases in prominence. Consider the case of Amazon, a studio that, in theory, has the infrastructure and the customer base in place to skip theaters entirely and stream straight to homes. Contrary to Netflix \u2014 whose executives openly sneer at theatrical exhibition \u2014 Amazon has stepped up their distribution efforts. This has a great deal of appeal to the people behind the cameras.\u201cFilmmakers want to go where they feel their work is respected and where a company has the resources to deliver on their vision,\u201d Christine Vachon, the founder of Killer Films, told Variety when the industry mag covered Amazon\u2019s increased efforts at distribution. \u201cAmazon is delivering on all counts.\u201dBut getting movies into theatres is only half the battle: you have to make the experience worthwhile for audiences. As Goldstein put it, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to advertise a show time and have a patron go to a theatre \u2014 you want to make sure that they\u2019re seeing the perfect version every single time that movie\u2019s shown.\u201dEnter the team at IMAX, which has emerged as the gold standard in exhibition over the past decade or two. I\u2019ll admit to having been skeptical about IMAX\u2019s push into multiplexes \u2014 in large part because the screens are smaller than those we grew used to at museums \u2014 but over the past few years, IMAX has been the only format in which I\u2019ve yet to have a bad experience. In addition to properly training theatre workers and ensuring that the air quality in a screening room does not degrade the equipment, IMAX focuses on important-yet-oft-ignored technical matters such as bulb brightness.If something goes wrong at a theater, IMAX employees can fix it almost immediately because the company literally has a command center that monitors the quality of projection in real time.\u201cAll of our systems are connected to our INOC \u2014 our IMAX Network Operations Centre \u2014 and they\u2019re wired to that centre through the Internet,\u201d said Colin Smyth, IMAX\u2019s senior vice president of global theatre services. \u201cSo for example, if a system calibration failed in a theatre in China ... we would take action on that. And we would contact the theatre and perhaps remotely log in to find out why it failed and what we need to do to make sure that the system is being properly calibrated and that projectors are in alignment and the light output is, you know, right [and] it meets the standard and so on.\u201dThe goal is to ensure that every audience member enjoys the same experience no matter where in the world he or she is \u2014 a matter of some importance to the filmmakers who have come to rely on the IMAX brand.\u201cWhen you look at a filmmaker like Christopher Nolan \u2014 I think I can, I don\u2019t want to put words in his mouth \u2014 but you know we can guarantee filmmakers of that calibre, like J.J. Abrams, your Zack Snyders, they\u2019re not creating movies for you to watch them on a mobile phone or even a laptop. They are, we like to say, they dream in IMAX. They want to see their vision come to life in the biggest way possible,\u201d an IMAX spokesperson said.It is, perhaps, unrealistic to expect every single movie screen in America to be monitored in real time 24/7/365, as IMAX does. But if you want audiences to share the dream in a theatre, as the original dreamer intended, then ensuring the highest-quality theatrical experience possible needs to be a bigger priority for everyone in the movie industry.\u2014 By arrangement with The Washington PostPublished in Dawn, ICON, October 22nd, 2017\n", "title": "WIDE ANGLE: A WORTHWHILE EXPERIENCE", "author": "Sonny Bunch"}, "1365473": {"date": "Updated October 22, 2017", "article": "THE US nearly brokered a deal last weekend to avert the current crisis over the disputed city of Kirkuk, where Iraqi forces and some Iranian-supported militias displaced Kurdish fighters this week.It has been widely reported that Iraqi security forces entered Kirkuk and a nearby military base and oil fields because of a deal made by the relatives of the late Jalal Talabani, the former Iraqi president and Kurdish revolutionary who died this month. That deal, forged by Talabani\u2019s widow, Hero, and others in her family with the head of Iran\u2019s Quds Force, Qassem Soleimani, has uprooted the unity Kurds have enjoyed since the 2003 war to liberate Iraq. The Kurdistan regional government president, Massoud Barzani, has called Hero a traitor, while Kurds loyal to Talabani have accused Barzani of bringing another calamity upon their people.But this is only part of the story. According to US, Kurdish, Iraqi and European officials familiar with the diplomacy, the US special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter the militant Islamic State group, Brett McGurk, came very close to a face-saving compromise between the Kurdistan regional government and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi over the weekend before Abadi ordered his forces into Kirkuk.These officials said that the McGurk compromise would wrest Kurdish control of a military air base outside of Kirkuk known as K-1, where many US special operators are currently stationed. Between 2014 and this week, the K-1 base was secured by Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Like the Kurdish fighters stationed in Kirkuk and the surrounding oil fields, they took up these positions after the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of an IS surge in 2014.The US compromise would have offered a joint administration of the military base for both Kurds and Iraqis with a US general (agreed to by both sides) to settle disputes. The theory was this would have allowed Abadi to save face after last month\u2019s Kurdish independence referendum while avoiding the trauma of Iraqi forces taking over a multi-ethnic city that Kurds have long considered their Jerusalem.But much like the last-minute effort to persuade Kurdish leaders to back off the independence referendum, the US compromise did not convince Abadi to avert the military operation into Kirkuk. According to one Western diplomat who was working on the deal, McGurk asked Abadi for another day on Sunday, only a few hours before he ordered his forces into Kirkuk. But Abadi did not oblige.The Kirkuk crisis began to boil as early as October 13. That is when Abadi gave Kurdish leaders a 48-hour deadline to remove their forces from Kirkuk and the surrounding areas. This prompted members of both major Kurdish parties \u2014 including relatives of Talabani \u2014 to frantically call US and British officials to put pressure on Abadi to back off.By Saturday, the Kurdish leadership recognised it had a major problem. Both the Talabani faction and the faction loyal to the current Kurdistan regional government president met at Lake Dokan for a summit to discuss Abadi\u2019s warning and the potential compromise to stave off the Iraqi military operation. The location was important because it is a midway point between the regional capital of Irbil, which is traditionally loyal to the Barzani family, and Sulaymaniyah, the seat of power for the Talabani faction.But the Kurdish summit did not reach consensus on the US compromise. McGurk pleaded for more time with Abadi. But time ran out. By Sunday, Talabani\u2019s widow travelled back to Sulaymaniyah with most of her clan. Later in that day they cut the deal with Iran\u2019s Soleimani. The rest is history.Now the Kurds have lost their Jerusalem, as Iraqi forces approach what Kurds voted last month should eventually be their independent state\u2019s national borders.\u2014By arrangement with Bloomberg-The Washington PostPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2017\n", "title": "US failed to stave off Iraq\u2019s advance on the Kurds", "author": "Eli Lake"}, "1367962": {"date": "Updated November 03, 2017", "article": "KARACHI: Despite being a clean and cheaper source of energy, compressed natural gas (CNG) has been unable to beat the use of petrol, which continues to post sale and import records. Petrol imports hit a record high of 549,968 tonnes in September while its sales stood at 642,000 tonnes. Petrol sales reached their peak of 684,440 tonnes in August. In October, petrol imports were 447,128 tonnes while sales stood at 595,000 tonnes, an official of the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) said. Petrol off-take has been surging owing to rising sales of two- and four-wheelers. Imports of used cars of mostly small engine power are also boosting petrol demand. Petrol sales may remain robust in coming years following the arrival of car assemblers from South Korea and China and the planned rollout of new models by existing automakers. According to the OCAC official, petrol demand is likely to cross 9m tonnes by 2020-21. Amid growing petrol sales, CNG station owners claim that their fuel still costs less than petrol. Yet consumers seem to prefer petrol to CNG because of various reasons. The official in charge of the All Pakistan CNG Association (APCNGA) Sindh Zone, Shabbir Sulemanji, said the consumption of CNG in the province has declined to 80 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) from 85mmcfd last year. People shifted to petrol without realising that CNG offers higher savings, he said. \u201cCNG still costs 30-32 per cent less than petrol,\u201d he said. The petrol price went up by Rs2.49 per litre on Nov 1. He added that the saving level would further rise in case petrol became costlier. Consumers in Sindh have witnessed a jump of over Rs10 per kilogram in the CNG rate since December 2016 when its price was de-regularised. Its price in Sindh hovers around Rs77-78 per kg. APCNGA former chairman Ghayas Paracha said using CNG costs 28pc less than using petrol. In Punjab, the CNG price hovers around Rs53-55 per litre. The use of CNG in Punjab touched the peak of 200mmcfd in 2011-12 when almost 2,400 pumps were operational. Its consumption declined to 9mmcfd in the first half of 2015. After the introduction of re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) in June 2015, the consumption of CNG in Punjab increased and now it hovers around 70mmcfd, he said. Currently, 900 of 2,400 CNG outlets in Punjab are in operation. But they have been witnessing only 3-4pc growth in sales for the last three to four months, Mr Paracha said. He claimed that one of the reasons for heavy smog in Punjab was the falling use of CNG. Only 900,000 vehicles, including ones used in public transport, now run on CNG against the 2013 estimate of 3.7m vehicles. He said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has 537 CNG stations, which consume 81mmcfd of gas. Balochistan has 25 CNG stations where 3mmcfd of gas is used. He said the introduction of electronic fuel injection (EFI) engines in imported and locally assembled cars in the last eight years has also encouraged vehicle owners to use petrol. \u201cPetrol sales are still going strong in Punjab despite cheaper CNG,\u201d he said, adding that the CNG body is in talks with the government to allow the import of new technology kits that will push up CNG savings by 10pc. The CNG association has also requested the government to allow cylinders with a capacity of 32kg instead of 55kg. New kits and cylinder imports will be for EFI car engines. Due to the improved supply of CNG in Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s LNG imports in July-September swelled to $397m from $253m a year ago. Total LNG imports hit $1.3 billion in 2016-17 against $567m in 2015-16. The country\u2019s total car sales were 50,640 units in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, up from 41,405 units a year ago. Total car sales in 2016-17 surged to 185,781 units from 118,830 units in 2013-14, according to the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association. Pakistan\u2019s total local bike production reached 2.4m units in 2016-17 from 2.1m units in 2015-16, figures compiled by the Engineering Development Board show. Bike dealers believe two-wheelers consume over 60pc of total petrol used in the country.

True, these efforts signify that the threat of an imminent breakdown of ties in the wake of US President Trump\u2019s unveiling of his administration\u2019s Afghanistan strategy has been averted. Still, we need to temper expectations. Ties remain in trouble. This won\u2019t change unless common ground is found on issues that really matter. One-off successes like the freeing of the kidnapped American-Canadian couple will offer breathing space \u2014 no more. For some years, Pakistan-US ties have been marked by persistent demands on both sides for the other to do more. However, there was also a recognition that they won\u2019t get nearly as much as they were asking for, and, more importantly, that there weren\u2019t any extreme measures worth the cost to force the other side to concede. The US has continued to press the issue of the Haqqani network and Afghan Taliban sanctuaries. Yet, previous administrations shied away from coercive measures against Pakistan, seeing these options as cost-prohibitive. Pakistani officials remained paranoid about America\u2019s long-term regional intentions. Still, there was no serious effort to pursue a regional policy without some sort of partnership with the US.  The desire to continue engaging remains intact on both sides. But the US ask that Pakistan eliminate Afghan insurgent sanctuaries has not changed. This is now a one-point agenda. Every conversation about Pakistan\u2019s long-term importance is in cold storage; the talk in Washington of employing coercive measures is louder than ever. Further, the current US foreign policy orientation holds a strong preference for quick, tangible results. \nThere\u2019s no room for complacency in Pak-US ties.\nThe dynamic on Pakistan\u2019s side doesn\u2019t instil much confidence in the future of ties either. Pakistani officials sense the delicacy of the moment and thus will want to work out feasible concessions to the US that signal positive intent and avoid harsh action. Beyond this though, acquiescing fully to the US ask regarding the Haqqanis and Taliban has never been seen favourably. If anything, the current environment will likely reinforce the reluctance to bite the bullet. I sense consensus within Pakistani officialdom on two points: the new US strategy is seen as one aimed at defeating the Taliban on the battlefield rather than politically accommodating them; and that this approach is certain to work to Pakistan\u2019s disadvantage (and to India\u2019s advantage). Corollary: all-out support to the strategy will continue to be seen as self-defeating. Also, while the aura of unpredictability around US foreign policy in general is making decision-makers nervous, it is also forcing some within the system to argue that Pakistan must proactively plan for a minus-US scenario. If so, Pakistan\u2019s current engagement with the US may signify a buy-time approach. Meanwhile, one could expect Pakistan to proactively try and influence US strategy, most likely by pushing for a politics-first approach that seeks to accommodate the Taliban sooner rather than later. Here\u2019s the problem. The US is set to remain focused on the sanctuaries and opposes any proposal that may detract from this. Pakistan will be hoping to use its initial flexibility (for example, by actions such as freeing the hostages) to pull Washington away from its maximum ask. Yet, the Washington policy community may interpret Pakistan\u2019s flexibility as evidence that Trump\u2019s tough talk is working. The inclination would be to hunker down further. But desired results on the US\u2019s principal ask will still not be forthcoming. At the same time, Pakistan\u2019s political appetite to absorb public rebuke would be limited in an election year. Any propensity by the political elite to respond emotively will further em\u00ad\u00adpower the Washing\u00adton voices who want to see Pakistan punished. And as temperatures rise, those within the Pakistani system advocating a minus-US formula will gain traction. This is a recipe for disaster. For things to work out differently, both sides must acknowledge the elephant in the room: a mutual feeling that each side\u2019s preferred endgame in Afghanistan is unacceptable to the other. Pakistan believes the US is pursuing a \u2018basing\u2019 strategy that will leave its troops and bases in Afghanistan indefinitely. The goal, as internalised by the policy enclave, would be to keep the region (Pakistan, China, Russia, Iran) off-balance; India would gain further ground. The US is convinced that Pakistan continues to provide active support to Afghan insurgents to prevent US gains and keep the Taliban strong to counter India. But the US does not buy Pakistan\u2019s take on India; it sees the military as paranoid in this regard. These deep divergences are not easily reconciled. Yet, till they are, the ties will remain on the brink.

The treatment meted out to them was simply unacceptable, they said. \u201cWe will surely miss the opening day ceremony of the birth anniversary and will barely be able to catch the third day\u2019s celebrations after 18-hour long journey,\u201d they said.Dr Dharampal, president of Hindu Panchayat Committee, said that he had rushed to Shikarpur after he was told the train was delayed. Nanik Bijaj criticised the railway authorities for mistreatment of yatris and said local dharmashala volunteers helped the pilgrims at the railway station and provided them food and whatever they needed to ease their long wait. Murli Dhar, a pilgrim, said that 10 coaches had been booked in advance for 734 yatris but unfortunately they had to wait 10 long hours before they could set out on their journey. They were told the train had been delayed due to heavy smog in Punjab, they said.The station master, however, denied mistreatment of yatris and said all facilities including drinking water and security had been provided to the pilgrims.

He\u2019s introduced musical concerts and movies again and is seen as the force behind the king\u2019s decision to grant women the right to drive as of next year.Opposition to the changes has so far been muted, but some critics of the prince have been detained. When social openings in the kingdom were taking place four decades ago, Sunni extremists opposed to the monarchy laid siege to Islam\u2019s holiest site in Makkah.Prince Mohammed\u2019s agenda is upending the ruling Al Saud\u2019s long-standing alliance with the kingdom\u2019s clerical establishment in favour of synchronising with a more cosmopolitan, global capitalism that appeals to international investors and maybe even non-Muslim tourists.The prince grabbed headlines in recent days by vowing a return to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d. He also suggested that his father\u2019s generation had steered the country down a problematic path and that it was time to \u201cget rid of it\u201d.In his sweeping \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan to wean Saudi Arabia off of its near total dependence on petrodollars, Prince Mohammed laid out a vision for \u201ca tolerant country with Islam as its constitution and moderation as its method\u201d.Prince Mohammed, or MBS as he is widely known, used a rare public appearance on stage at a major investor conference in the capital, Riyadh, this week to drive home that message to a global audience.\u201cWe only want to go back to what we were: moderate Islam that is open to the world, open to all religions,\u201d he said in the ornate grand hall of the Ritz-Carlton. \u201cWe will not waste 30 years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas. We will destroy them today.\u201d His remarks were met with applause and a front-page article in the Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper. In expanded remarks to the paper, the 32-year-old prince said that successive Saudi monarchs \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to deal with\u201d Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution that brought to power a clerical Shia leadership still in place today.That same year Saudi rulers weathered a stunning blow: Sunni extremists laid siege to Islam\u2019s holiest site in Makkah for 15 days. The attack was carried out by militants opposed to social openings taking place at the time, seeing them as Western and un-Islamic.Indeed, Sunni extremists have used the intolerant views propagated by the ideology known as Wahhabism to justify violence against others. Wahhabism has governed life in Saudi Arabia since its foundation 85 years ago.The ruling Al Saud responded to the events of 1979 by empowering the state\u2019s ultraconservatives. To hedge the international appeal of Iran\u2019s Shia revolution, the government backed efforts to export the kingdom\u2019s foundational Wahhabi ideology abroad.To appease a sizeable conservative segment of the population at home, cinemas were shuttered, women were banned from appearing on state television and the religious police were emboldened.Much is now changing under the crown prince as he consolidates greater powers and prepares to inherit the throne.There are plans to build a Six Flags theme park and a semi-autonomous Red Sea tourist destination where the strict rules on women\u2019s dress will likely not apply. Females have greater access to sports, the powers of the once-feared religious police have been curtailed and restrictions on gender segregation are being eased.Unlike previous Saudi monarchs, such as King Abdullah who backed gradual and cautious openings, Prince Mohammed is moving quickly.More than half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s 20 million citizens are below the age of 25, meaning millions of young Saudis will be entering the workforce in the coming decade. The government is urgently trying to create more jobs and ward off the kinds of grievances that sparked uprisings in other Arab countries where unemployment is rampant and citizens have little say in government.The prince has to find solutions now for the problems he is set to inherit as monarch.\u201cWhat MBS is doing is a must requirement for any kind of economic reform. Economic reform requires a new Protestant ethic if you will, a new brand of Islam,\u201d said Maamoun Fandy, director of the London Global Strategy Institute.This new Saudi version of \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d can be understood as one that is amenable to economic reforms; it does not close shops at prayer time or banish women from public life, Fandy said.In other words, Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic reforms require social reforms to succeed.Buzz words like \u201creform\u201d, \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d all used by the prince in his promotion of Vision 2030 do not, however, mean that Saudi Arabia is moving toward greater liberalism, democracy, pluralism or freedom of speech.The government does not grant licences to non-Muslim houses of worship, and limits those of its Shia Muslim citizens.The prince has also made no mention of human rights concerns. If anything, dozens of the prince\u2019s perceived critics have been detained in a warning to others who dare to speak out.Some of those arrested were seen as critics of his foreign policies, which include severing ties with Qatar, increasing tensions with Iran and overseeing air strikes in Yemen that have killed scores of civilians and drawn sharp condemnation from rights groups and some in Washington.Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed faces a Saudi public that remains religiously conservative. That means he still needs public support from the state\u2019s top clerics in order to position his reforms as Islamic and religiously permissible.These clerics, many of whom had spoken out in the past against women working and driving, appear unwilling or unable to publicly criticise the moves. In this absolute monarchy, the king holds final say on most matters and the public has shown it is welcoming the changes.\u2014APPublished in Dawn, October 29th, 2017\n", "title": "Saudi promise of \u2018moderate Islam\u2019 shifts power", "author": "Aya Batrawy"}, "1365495": {"date": "October 22, 2017", "article": "\n\nDama duties\n\n\n'Hope for our country'\n\n\nWhile Chinese President Xi Jinping and his cohorts chart the nation's future at their leadership conclave in Beijing, his citizen army of red-armbanded foot soldiers are keeping an eye out for trouble outside.Stationed on street corners, in front of shops and outside bars, civilians with armbands labelled \u201cPublic Security Volunteer\u201d have deployed across the capital as the Communist Party holds its crucial five-yearly gathering. The formalised neighbourhood watch patrols come out in full force during special events like the congress, which is being held mostly behind closed doors and will likely hand Xi a second five-year term when it ends on Tuesday. The civilians are just one piece of the comprehensive security apparatus for the conclave: from black-uniformed guards who stand sentry on pavements to identification checks at subway stations. While they see themselves as providers of a public service, their presence is a reminder of the scrutiny that the Communist authorities maintain over citizens. \u201cWe're in the business of improving people's quality of life,\u201d said Ma Shuying, a 60-year-old party member who was patrolling the area underneath a bridge in Beijing's city centre. Ma arrived at her spot at 7:00 am on the opening day of the congress on Wednesday, ready to look out for trouble. In her 17 years as a member of the patrol, Ma has witnessed few incidents, she said, because \u201cBeijing is so safe.\u201d \u201cWe're more here to give community members a sense of security,\u201d she beamed, undeterred by the grey smog and light rain. \u201cPeople see us and feel that they're being taken care of. And when government officials see us during important political events, they know that we're supporting their work.\u201dDama duties\nThere are 850,000 registered public security volunteers in Beijing, the city announced this summer, organising under neighbourhood tags like the \u201cFengtai Persuaders,\u201d the \u201cChaoyang Masses\u201d and the \u201cXicheng Dama.\u201d (In Chinese, \u201cdama\u201d is a colloquial term used to describe rambunctious elderly women who congregate in loud groups, dance in public squares and mind other people's business.) Despite their striking \u201cvolunteer\u201d armbands, many of the patrollers approached by AFP appeared not to be serving the people for free. One middle-aged woman standing outside a subway station looked up from her phone long enough to say that it was \u201ccompany policy\u201d not to speak to reporters. Another two armband-wearers who were helping to direct traffic in a busy commercial district appeared bewildered when asked whether they were volunteers. \u201cWe're working,\u201d said a woman who looked harried as she pointed a driver to a parallel parking spot. \u201cThey just gave us these armbands to wear.\u201d Even Ma, who also handles Communist Party affairs on her neighbourhood committee, earns 3,000 yuan ($450) a month for performing her duties. These range from telling people about their retirement benefits to helping them rid their homes of mice. \u201cAll my neighbours know me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives me a warm feeling inside.\u201d Several other volunteers declined to be interviewed, either because they were \u201con duty\u201d or were concerned that a foreign journalist would not lend \u201cpositive energy\u201d to their vocation. 'Hope for our country'\nSome of the neighbourhood patrollers were truly volunteers, claiming no benefits other than the joys of the job. Standing outside a shopping centre, a 68-year-old who only gave his surname, Ren, complained about the air pollution.While major political events in Beijing generally enjoy blue skies brought on by government-ordered factory shutdowns, the party congress has faced rainy weather and grey air. Ren's daughter lives in Vancouver, Canada, where the air is much better, he said. But he doesn't plan on moving there. \u201cMy whole life is in China,\u201d he said. Ren started volunteering during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. His main duty, he said, has been giving tourists directions. Like many volunteers, he was impressed by Xi's lengthy opening speech on Wednesday. \u201cThe problem of corruption has not entirely been solved, but the general mood is different,\u201d Ren said. \u201cIn the past, whenever you went to the supermarket during holidays you would see officials splurging, and everyone knew they were spending public funds.\u201d Ma proudly remarked that Xi's anti-graft campaign was going strong even in her small neighbourhood office, where she isn't allowed to use the computers to shop online or play video games. \u201cBecause of the president's efforts against corruption, there is hope for our party and there is hope for our country,\u201d she said. Yang Zhiling, 69, who was collecting rubbish around a bike rack, said she was inspired by Xi's stamina. \u201cPresident Xi remained standing for a whole three and a half hours!

A local official said tribal elders were seeking to broker a deal under which remaining IS fighters, including foreigners, would leave the city, taking civilians with them as human shields. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), backed by air strikes and special forces from a US-led international coalition, have been battling since June to oust IS from Raqqa, a base that it had used to plan attacks against the West. \n100 militants have already surrendered arms\nThe retaking of Raqqa will be a major milestone in efforts to roll back the so-called \u201ccaliphate\u201d that IS declared in Syria and Iraq, where earlier this year it was driven from the city of Mosul. \u201cThe battles are continuing in Raqqa city,\u201d YPG spokesman Nouri Mahmoud, whose group dominates the SDF, said by telephone. \u201cDaesh [IS] is on the verge of being finished. Today or tomorrow, the city may be liberated.\u201d The US-led coalition said a convoy was set to depart Raqqa soon under an arrangement brokered by local officials. Its statement said the coalition was not involved in the discussions, and described the arrangement as \u201ca civilian evacuation\u201d. Its spokesman, Col Ryan Dillon, said the coalition\u2019s stance was that IS fighters must surrender unconditionally, but added that he could not comment on who would be in the convoy. He said difficult fighting was expected in the days ahead.

The coalition believed the arrangement would  \u201csave innocent lives and allow Syrian Democratic Forces and the coalition to focus on defeating Daesh terrorists in Raqqa with less risk of civilian casualties\u201d, it said. Omar Alloush, a member of the Raqqa Civil Council, set up to run Raqqa after it is freed from IS, said the 100 IS fighters who had already surrendered had been convinced to do so during talks with the tribal elders. \u201cOthers didn\u2019t surrender, so now they\u2019re looking for a plan where they (IS) leave and take civilian hostages with them to another place far from the city, and then release the civilians,\u201d he said in an interview in Ain Issa, north of Raqqa. The IS fighters would go to remaining territory held by the group in Syria, he said. The deal could happen soon. A tribal leader said he expected the evacuation to take place on Saturday or Sunday. A group that reports on Raqqa, \u201cRaqqa is being slaughtered silently\u201d, said on its Facebook page that dozens of buses had entered the city overnight from the countryside to the north. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based organisation that reports on the war, said Syrian IS fighters and their families had already left the city, and buses had arrived to evacuate remaining foreign fighters and their families.Published in Dawn, October 15th, 2017\n", "title": "IS on verge of defeat in its Syrian bastion", "author": "Reuters"}, "1364619": {"date": "October 18, 2017", "article": "India's environmental watchdog shut down a coal-fired power plant and banned the use of diesel generators in New Delhi as air quality plummeted in the world's most polluted capital on Wednesday, the start of the Diwali festival. New Delhi experiences suffocating smog every year around Diwali, when farmers in north India burn the stubble left behind after the harvest and revellers let off smoke-spewing firecrackers. The onset of winter aggravates the problem as the cooler air traps the pollutants, a phenomenon known as inversion. The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Board, a statutory body, made the ruling as levels of PM2.5 pollutants in the air reached around 200 micrograms per cubic metre \u2014 eight times the World Health Organisation safe limit of 25. \u201cDifficult situations demand tough responses and solutions and Delhi is faced with a really difficult situation each winter when air pollution levels spiral out of control,\u201d said its chairman Bhure Lal in a statement. The Board said the city's Badarpur power plant, which has a capacity of around 700 megawatts, would be closed until March. The plant is due to shut down for good next July as India seeks to move away from heavily-polluting fossil fuels. It also banned the use of the privately-owned diesel generators that many rich households rely on during India's frequent power cuts. The measures follow a temporary ban on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi introduced earlier this month by the Supreme Court to ease the pollution levels. Last year, levels of PM2.5 \u2014 the fine particles linked to higher rates of chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and heart disease \u2014 soared to 778 in the days that followed Diwali, prompting the Supreme Court to warn of a public health emergency. Levels of PM2.5 between 301 and 500 are classified as \u201chazardous\u201d, while anything over 500 is beyond the official index. The Delhi government then shut schools for three days, banned all construction work for five days to curb dust levels and temporarily closed the Badarpur plant.

Among the several speakers was historian Dr Mubarak Ali, whose paper \u2018Ulema Aur Russi Inqilab\u2019 was also read out.\nScholars, academicians discuss impact of Russian Revolution\nThe paper cited various historical examples of Russian revolutions that had taken place, the news of which had reached the Indian subcontinent.One example which had surprised the Indians was Russia\u2019s defeat at the hands of Japan in 1905. However, not much was known to the people of the subcontinent about internal strife and revolts that had taken place within Russia.According to Dr Ali, it was after the start of World War I in 1914 in which Indian soldiers had also participated, the news that the Russian Revolution had toppled the ruling elite and established power reached the subcontinent. Scholar Dr Naazir Mehmood, when speaking about the\u00a0collapse of the USSR, shared his personal experience of having lived there and was an eyewitness to some of the events that had precipitated its collapse.\u00a0\u201cI landed in Moscow in 1984 while I was a student political activist inPakistan. It was a period when the Soviet power was at its height but the negative thing was, that in two years from 1982-84, three senior leaders died.\u201cI was present when Gorbachev came into power and initiated his reforms. My first impression was very positive.\u201dDr Mehmood narrated how everybody living in Moscow had been provided their basic rights like security, education, health, water and sanitation, infrastructure etc. However, things began to change once he travelled out of Moscow.\u201cI travelled across the Soviet Union and interacted with the common people without any restriction. Outside of Moscow, there was shortage of food items and other facilities.\u201cI found out that if Moscow was the brighter side of the socialist system, the people of Azerbaijan were complaining about being exploited.\u201cThe feelings of discontent and dissatisfaction were very much present. And under those circumstances a breath of fresh air came for the people when Gorbachev came into power,\u201d said Dr Mehmood.However, in retrospect, said Dr Mehmood, \u201cGorbachev did not have a very well-thought out plan; he demolished the system without having a replacement which is one of the major reasons why the USSR collapsed.\u201dThe rise of fascism did not leave artists untouched as they were not only directly impacted but were also inspired by it.This was put forward by\u00a0Dr Talat Ahmed from the University ofEdinburgh\u00a0who presented her topic on the \u2018Impact of Russian Revolution on contemporary art, literature, and theatre\u2019. She charted out extensively the specific period in the early 1930s in which writers and other intellectuals, especially the All-India Progressive Writers\u2019 Association, were deeply inspired by the political occurrences in Russia.\u00a0Writers from the Urdu canon, as well as those writing in Hindi literature, she said, were very much inspired by Marxism. \u201cSajjad Zaheer, founder of the Progressive Writers\u2019 Movement, was a Communist Party member. And this was no accident. Another notable name, though not part of the Communist Party, was novelist Mulk Raj Anand whose trajectory shows the influence of the events of 1917.\u201dDr\u00a0Ahmed also spoke about a\u00a0conference held in Moscow in 1934 which had laid out the credentials of what the policy on art and literature should look like. \u201cAt that particular conference, the keynote speech was Maxim Gorky\u2019s, where he spoke about how writers have to be engineers for the society they are going to be forming,\u201d she added.The conference was well-attended by students who eagerly put forth questions to the scholars.Published in Dawn, October 18th, 2017\n", "title": "\u2018Economic disparity across USSR led to its collapse\u2019", "author": "Haneen Rafi"}, "1365239": {"date": "October 21, 2017", "article": "LAHORE: The Punjab Environment Protection Department told the Lahore High Court on Friday the chief minister had signed a \u2018smog policy\u2019 which would be notified in the official gazette in a day. A legal adviser of the department presented the draft of the policy before the court and shared its salient features. He said the air monitoring system would be expanded under the smog policy besides enforcement of the Pollution Charge Rules of 2001 and environmental laws. He said with the upgrade of the central laboratory a checks and balance system would be introduced in collaboration with the Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industries on industrial units emitting green house gas emissions. The adviser said that public awareness campaigns on all media regarding protective measures would be launched and also in schools where children were likely to suffer from smog related issues. Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah adjourned hearing till Nov 8 and directed the law officer to present the notification of the policy before the court.Advocate Sheraz Zaka had filed a public interest petition last year after a dense smog engulfed the city and affected a large number of citizens. He submitted that in 1952 the smog was faced by London, which thereafter implemented environmental laws and introduced the Clean Air Act of 1956. He said the coal industry in Britain was shut down by then British prime minister Margaret Thatcher in order to curb air and noise pollution. The lawyer said that the Punjab government had created a misconception that the smog transpired due to burning of agricultural waste in the Indian province of Punjab. He said the reason behind the smog was the lack of enforcement of environmental laws and dysfunctional central laboratory in Lahore. He argued that the government had not taken any adequate awareness measures amongst the public.Law officers: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday directed the advocate general of Punjab to apprise the court of the procedure for the appointment of the law officers in the province.Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah was hearing a petition moved by two lawyers who had challenged the appointment process for government\u2019s law officers and sought directions for it to formulate a mechanism for the purpose beyond political considerations. Advocate Ch Shoaib Saleem argued that the law officers had been appointed on political consideration and they remained loyal to the ruling government instead of the state. He said the government\u2019s lawyers drew salaries from the taxpayers\u2019 money but defended a specific political government. Mr Saleem referred to a recent incident wherein an additional advocate general, belonging to lawyers\u2019 wing of the PML-N, had slapped a police officer outside a court of Islamabad during hearing of the National Accountability Bureau references against the Sharif family. He said the conduct of the law officer, who was later sacked, had established that the law officers had been appointed merely on political grounds. The petitioner-lawyer said appointment mechanism of law officers was not regulated by any rules or law and it was totally dependent on the will of the executive head of the government. He pleaded that professionalism could be introduced in the law officers if some procedure was adopted for appointments at the Advocate General\u2019s office through proper advertisements, written tests or interviews. Opposing the petition, Additional Advocate General Anwaar Hussain argued that the chief minister of the province enjoyed discretionary powers under Article 140 of the Constitution to make appointments at the Advocate General\u2019s office. He said the Supreme Court had already decided a similar matter and upheld the powers of the executive. The chief justice deferred further hearing till Nov 13 and directed the AGP to apprise it of the mechanism for the recruitment of the law officers.Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2017\n", "title": "Smog policy in the works, LHC told", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter"}, "1364401": {"date": "Updated October 17, 2017", "article": "ISLAMABAD: A ladder rests against the wall of the Out Patient Department (OPD) at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) where workers are adding a fresh coat of paint to the building.

The situation inside the Emergency Ward is even more precarious. A few nurses run from one patient to the other trying to keep up with the number of patients they have to treat.  The patients will have to wait till 11am before they can be treated. For the last two weeks, the protesters gather in front of the administration department at Pims early in the morning and register their protest before getting back to work at 11am.Pims was merged with SZAMBU in 2013 when the university was established through a law passed by the previous Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government.The employees of Pims \u2014 one of the largest hospitals of the country and perhaps the only government-run state-of-the-art facility for patients in the entire northern region \u2014 say that this merger deprived them of basic rights such as gratuity, promotions, residence and other facilities offered to civil servants in federal departments.So they have decided to gather in front of their own \u2018Hyde Park\u2019 \u2014 the driveway in front of the Pims administration department \u2014 to demand a reversal of the decision. The protesters have given the government a deadline of Oct 18 to accept their demand for separation of the hospital from the university, and have threatened to escalate the protest if their demands are not met.  On this particular day, the protesters are charged up, rehearsing and bucking each other up to get ready for the final showdown.A dais has been set up for those who will make the speeches, while other staffers \u2014 some in uniform, others without \u2014 sit on chairs or stand in disciplined rows.     One of the speakers pauses mid-speech looking to catch a breath, and the warm air erupts with shouts of: \u201cVC ka jo yaar hai, ghaddaar hai ghaddaar hai. Hum sub aik hain, hum sub saath hain!\u201d(Whoever supports the vice chancellor is a traitor. We are one in our demand.)Raising his voice above the cacophony of sloganeering, Manzar Shah, a senior leader of the association, announces that they will set up beds and workstations in open air to treat serious patients in the OPD but will not work inside the hospital until their demands are met.Doctor Asfandyar Khan, another leader, suggests that they need to take the strike up a notch. \u201cEvery department has stopped working except one, the sanitation workers. We have asked them to continue working because that will be the final phase of the strike. The day they stop their work will be the day you will realise how far we can go,\u201d he says, while addressing the vice chancellor of SZAMBU and its senior officials.Then a song blares from the speakers: \u201cYe tera Pakistan hai, ye mera Pakistan hai, is ki bunyadon mein hai tera lahu, mera lahu.\u201d (This is your Pakistan and mine. In its foundation is your blood and mine.)Inside the administration block, offices of the Pims management are locked. \u201cThe VC was thrown out of the office a week ago by the protesters, so nobody from the management comes to this block now,\u201d says a guard on duty there. The rest of the staff is on strike, he adds.Professor Javed Akram, vice chancellor of SZAMBU, says he visits his office when required. \u201cI have three offices and sit wherever I\u2019m required. Right now I\u2019m leaving the Pims office,\u201d he says on the phone.\u201cRegarding the demands of the staff, I wrote to the government last year, requesting that Pims hospital be separated from the university, and the authorities are working on it.\u201dBut the employees are adamant. They are not willing to end their protest until they get a notification in writing.\u201cWe don\u2019t believe in verbal assurances. We want a notification of the separation of the university,\u201d says Mohammad Sharif Khattak, general secretary of United Action Committee of the employees.  At 11am, Khattak halts his speech and chants the final slogan, \u201cPakistan Zindabad!\u201dThe employees respond vociferously and head to their respective departments to resume work.An attendant of a patient shouts as he sees doctors and paramedics entering the building. \u201cThe strike is over, let\u2019s go in!\u201dPublished in Dawn, October 17th, 2017\n", "title": "A hospital on strike", "author": "Khurram Mehmood"}, "1363849": {"date": "Updated October 15, 2017", "article": "\n\nVasilisa defies the conventions of her society, choosing to hunt instead of staying home and raising children.\u2014 Illustration by Shaikh Sarfaraz Ahmed\n\n\nIn 2015, Usman Tanveer Malik\u2019s non-fiction piece in the Herald titled Rockets, Robots and Reckless Imagination: How Science Fiction can Spur Pakistan into the 21st Century claimed that \u201cEncouraging science fiction, fantasy and horror readership has the potential to alleviate or fix many of Pakistan\u2019s problems.\u201d The basis of his belief was that we as a nation lacked empathy and imagination, and reading these genres could help nurture those traits in us, which in turn would solve many of our issues such as intolerance and fundamentalism.I thought so too, and the idea was novel, but I couldn\u2019t see it happening \u2014 couldn\u2019t see us changing our hearts and our heads with a dozen hundred page-flips. The spite had, after all, settled in deep.But one bright and searing afternoon in Lahore, I detoured to The Last Word bookshop and walked out with Katherine Arden\u2019s The Bear and the Nightingale. The novel\u2019s beauty preceded even the first page: the hardcover embellished in textured hues of green and orange, illustrated in the style of traditional Russian folkloric art. This was a book you didn\u2019t just want to read, but wanted your friends to know you were reading, and you would lend it to them if it didn\u2019t look so lovely on your drab bookshelf as a piece of literature worth reading.\nA debut fantasy novel draws readers into medieval Russia and manages to create empathy for women\u2019s struggles in societies such as ours\nI spent that night immersed in its world through the light of my phone.The story begins with the birth of the protagonist Vasilisa Petrovna, in a village in Rus\u2019 \u2014 what in the real world would probably consist of Belarus, Ukraine and parts of Russia \u2014 during a time when men travelled the soaring and aching lengths of the land to hunt for treasure, sell wares and fight wars. Women stayed at home; they mended clothes, cooked food and bore the men healthy children. That was what they were brought up for and that was what they were happy with. But Vasilisa is not like other women. She roams through the forest by herself, hunts animals and forages for berries and herbs. She can outswim and outrun many men and many demons. She is not as attractive as the other village girls \u2014 too thin, too proud, too outspoken \u2014 and, for what it is in her world (and ours), she hates marriage. But, she is magical. She can see the Chyerti \u2014 spirits and magical creatures of Russian folklore. The domovoi, for example, is a small, bearded, brown, gnome-like spirit that protects her home from evil in return for bread and milk. The spirit of the horses, the vazila, is similar in appearance (except that it is more rugged) and tends to the equines in her stable, giving them food and grooming them when need be. Many more similar spirits live scattered throughout the forest near her house. She can talk to them and learn from them. But the belief in the Chyerti is waning; Christianity has begun taking over as the leading religion and its propaganda is spreading, mystifying the people of Rus\u2019 through the churches, icons and priests that have been steadily migrating into the cities and villages. Vasilisa\u2019s role is manifold: she labours to protect her family, her faith and herself \u2014 who she is and what she believes in \u2014 but there are enemies working against her, demons and humans, sometimes both being one and the same.\n\n\n\nBut \u2014 and this is the best part \u2014 Vasilisa\u2019s magic is not the convenient plot device of the lazy writer. She has no easy way out, no miracles to fix everything in her life, no one-shot kill for the demons. Throughout the book, the greater magic manifests in how she strives for her friends and her family through no strength but her own.The prose is written in a fresh, Maximalist style, one that I haven\u2019t enjoyed reading so much in a very long time. Arden places an adjective or an adverb at every place she is able and it works, because she doesn\u2019t just stuff them in there; each word is carefully selected to be thematically relevant, and bring every bit of this fantasy world alive: \u201cThe wind sobbed. The trees whispered. The sun was a live thing, throwing its hot arms over their [the farmers] necks.\u201d In Arden\u2019s hands Rus\u2019 isn\u2019t fiction; Rus\u2019 is a world that once was real, and is now real again. Arden\u2019s novel breathes and lives and so does the world in it.The story often crosses genres, spanning historical fiction, fantasy and feminist literature. And surprisingly, it has one of the best horror segments I\u2019ve read in over two years now, passages that robbed me of my sleep and made me hear and see things crying and crawling in the dark.I completed the last hundred pages in a single stretch of night, pulling myself out of Rus\u2019s well near the chill of dawn. I thought a lot in that moment, when it was quiet and only my own breathing filled my ears, and I hoped I would dream that night, and I did, and then I continued dreaming for the many days and the many nights that followed.Perhaps Malik was right.Pakistan is a country for men. Maybe it wasn\u2019t made that way, but it exists that way now. And while growing up is difficult for all of us, it is even more so for the women. It is easy for men to say that we make an effort to sympathise with women\u2019s pains, with what it feels like to be birthed and raised in a country of oppression, in the same way we try to sympathise with the minorities, the ill, the poor. It is easy to say that we can imagine how it feels to lose out on equal opportunity, to be dictated to, to be unable to walk the streets and public places as we wish, not be allowed education or live life in a dozen or more ways as we wish to and others do. It\u2019s easy to say, but so much more difficult to live. But Arden\u2019s brilliant masterpiece does its best to try and emulate that; the beautiful prose and structural excellence help the reader slip into the shoes of the protagonist, and then walk a mile and then two and then a thousand in them, all through her birth and up till the novel\u2019s climactic finale. Vasilisa\u2019s struggle helped me understand the everyday plight of the Pakistani woman, of having to fight to be yourself, in a much better manner than any other medium had so far.It would be surprising if Arden\u2019s debut is not nominated for the World Fantasy Award. With exceptional skills at building a world and an evocative imagination, The Bear and the Nightingale is a performance worth admiring, and its themes make it a significant work of fantasy fiction that everyone should read. With this being just her debut, it\u2019s exciting to see what Arden will conjure next.The reviewer is a student at the Lahore University of Management Sciences and an editor at the LUMS Business ReviewThe Bear and the\nNightingale\nBy Katherine Arden\nDel Rey, US\nISBN: 9781101885932\n322pp. Published in Dawn, Books & Authors, October 15th, 2017\n", "title": "FICTION: SECRETS IN THE WOODS", "author": "Uzair Shahed Islam"}, "1367406": {"date": "October 31, 2017", "article": "BAHAWALPUR: The district administration has launched a campaign to control smog and to educate people on hazards of smog and the ways to protect themselves.

The condition of the field, which has been controlled by IS for three years, was not clear following intense coalition and Russian air strikes.The SDF, with air support from the US-led coalition, said it captured the field in a \u201cswift and wide military operation.\u201d It said some militants have taken cover in oil company houses nearby, where clashes are underway. The US-led coalition confirmed the SDF had retaken the oil field.After coming under heavy fire from IS, pro-government forces retreated from the area around Al-Omar field, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The SDF said government forces were 3 kilometres away from the fields.Syrian troops, backed by Russian warplanes and Iranian-sponsored militias, have retaken nearly all of the provincial capital of Deir el-Zour, as well as the town of Mayadeen, another IS stronghold, which is across the Euphrates River from the Al-Omar field.The SDF focused their operations in rural Deir el-Zour on the eastern side of the river, and have already seized a major natural gas field and other smaller oil fields.IS captured Al-Omar in 2014, when the group swept across large areas in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. At the time, the field was estimated to produce around 9,000 barrels a day. Its current potential is unknown.Syria had proven oil reserves of 2.5 billion barrels as of 2015, giving it the largest supply among its neighbours after Iraq. The oil industry was a pillar of the Syrian economy before the conflict in 2011.As IS advanced in Syria, it seized control of most of Syria\u2019s oil fields and made petroleum a major earner for the militant group, which sold it on the black market to other insurgents and the Syrian government.Since the coalition began operations against IS in 2014, the militants\u2019 oil production has been reduced from a peak of approximately $50 million per month to currently less than $4 million, the coalition said in a statement.The government lost the Al-Omar field to other insurgents in 2013.Al-Manar TV, operated by Hezbollah, said the fight for Al-Omar was still underway and denied the SDF\u2019s claim to have captured it. The militant group fights alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s forces.The official Syrian news agency said troops regained full control of Khosham, a town on the eastern side of the Euphrates River that they lost a day earlier to IS. The Observatory for Human Rights said parts of the town remain contested. It\u2019s not clear how Syrian troops will respond to the SDF\u2019s seizure of Al-Omar. Assad has vowed to eventually bring all of Syria back under government control.The two sides have accused each other of firing on their forces in Deir el-Zour province, but a rare face-to-face meeting of senior US and Russian military officers last month appeared to have calmed tensions.Syria observers have said the race between the US-backed fighters and the Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces is likely to be a source of direct confrontation in the absence of a political agreement.IS has suffered a series of major setbacks in recent months, including the loss of the Syrian city of Raqqa, once the extremists\u2019 self-styled capital, and the Iraqi city of Mosul. Most of the territory the group once held has been seized by an array of Syrian and Iraqi forces.An estimated 6,500 IS fighters remain in eastern Syria and western Iraq, many concentrated along the Euphrates River valley straddling the border, the US military said last week.Published in Dawn, October 23rd, 2017\n", "title": "US-backed forces take Syria\u2019s largest oil field from IS", "author": "AP"}, "1367244": {"date": "Updated October 30, 2017", "article": "Qatar's emir in an interview airing Sunday accused Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies of seeking to topple his government with its nearly five month old political and economic embargo of the tiny Gulf state.\"They want a regime change.

I am encouraging people to attend on Sunday to show the powers that be, on both sides, that people are concerned.\u201d Maltese politics is split between Prime Minister Joseph Muscat's centre-left Labour Party, and the centre-right Nationalists.Family party loyalty is strong. Come election time, families can expect personal visits to ensure turnout.

She said that the government had not provided any fund for the Environment Protection Department from last eight to ten years.She demanded that the government introduce a comprehensive bill on improving environment so that future generation could breathe in healthy air.She was supported by Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf MPA Sadia Sohail Rana, who, on a point of order, also criticised the government for not taking measures to improve the environment.She said that they should take care of the environment irrespective of their political affiliations because a large number of people were becoming lungs and cancer patients due to air pollution.She said the underground water of Lahore was also contaminated with arsenic.However, Law Minister Rana Sanaullah called the new bill compressive, saying it would address challenges to the environment.

The expert panel's report and tough remarks by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson overshadowed the announcement that UN-sponsored peace talks will resume next month. More than 87 people died on April 4 this year when sarin gas projectiles were fired into Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the Idlib province of northwestern Syria. Images of dead and dying victims, including young children, in the aftermath of the attack provoked global outrage and a US cruise missile strike on a regime air base. Syria and its ally Russia had suggested that a rebel weapon may have detonated on the ground but the UN panel confirmed Western intelligence reports that blamed the regime. \"The panel is confident that the Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Sheikhun on 4 April 2017,\" the report, seen by AFP, says. The report will increase pressure on Assad's regime just as Washington, in the wake of battlefield victories against the militant Islamic State (IS) group, renews calls for him to step down. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's comments to reporters came during a visit to Geneva in which he met UN envoy Staffan de Mistura, who is trying to convene a new round of peace talks next month. The secretary said US policy has not changed, but his remarks represented tougher language from an administration that had previously said Assad's fate is not a priority. \"We do not believe there is a future for the Assad regime, the Assad family,\" Tillerson said. \"I think I've said it on a number of occasions. The reign of the Assad family is coming to an end, and the only issue is how should that be brought about.\" Russia, which is running a parallel peace process with Iran and Turkey in a series of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana, reacted coolly to Tillerson's remarks. \"I think we should not pre-empt any future for anybody,\" said Moscow's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who on Tuesday had vetoed a US attempt to extend the gas attack probe. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UN panel's report had reached a \"clear conclusion\" and urged the \"international community to unite to hold Assad's regime accountable.\"\"I call on Russia to stop covering up for its abhorrent ally and keep its own commitment to ensure that chemical weapons are never used again,\" he said. Civil war\nDe Mistura hopes to convene an eighth round of Syrian peace talks between Assad's regime and an opposition coalition in Geneva from November 28. These will be focused on drafting a new constitution and holding UN-supervised elections in a country devastated by several overlapping bloody civil conflicts. Assad's regime has been saved by Russian and Iranian military intervention and he insists that he will not stand down in the face of what he regards as \"terrorist\" rebels. But Western capitals, the opposition and many of Syria's Arab neighbors hold Assad's forces responsible for the bulk of the 330,000 people who have died in the conflict. In addition to chemical weapons attacks against his own people, his government is accused of overseeing the large-scale torture and murder of civilian detainees. The previous US administration often said that Assad's days were numbered, but then president Barack Obama decided not to use force to punish his chemical weapons attacks. His successor, President Donald Trump, did order one missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to a chemical attack. But US policy has otherwise focused solely on the defeat of the Islamic State jihadist group, driving it out of its last bastions in eastern Syria's Euphrates valley. Tillerson said, however, that he hopes a way to oust Assad will \"emerge\" as part of de Mistura's UN-mediated talks. 'Moment of truth'\nHe argued that the UN Security Council resolution setting up the peace process already contains a procedure to hold elections that Washington does not think Assad can win. \"The only thing that changed is when this administration came into office, we took a view that it is not a prerequisite that Assad go before that process starts, rather the mechanism by which Assad departs will likely emerge from that process,\" he said. Earlier, de Mistura had told the UN Security Council that with the defeat of IS, the Syrian peace process had reached a \"moment of truth.\" \"We need to get the parties into real negotiations,\" the envoy said. Seven rounds of talks have achieved only incremental progress toward a political deal, with negotiations deadlocked over Assad's fate. The opposition insists any settlement must provide for a transition away from Assad's rule but, as government forces make gains, there is little likelihood of a breakthrough.\n", "title": "UN report blames gas attack on Syria's Assad regime", "author": "AFP"}, "1365813": {"date": "October 24, 2017", "article": "WASHINGTON: Prior to Sunday\u2019s ceremony awarding the 20th Mark Twain Prize for American Humour to David Letterman, the red-carpet question on everyone\u2019s minds had to be: to Trump or not to Trump?Each of the funny famous folks making their way down the red carpet at the Kennedy Centre before the big show had all been tasked with a tough job: roasting the 70-year-old king of late night at a time when the comedic landscape seems riddled with political punchlines packed with names like Trump and Harvey Weinstein.Would the night get serious or stay silly? It depended on who you asked.And it just so happened that the first big name to pose in front of the step-and-repeat was none other than Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night host whose sharp, politically minded monologues criticising the Cassidy-Graham health-care bill had one attendee branding him a \u2018hero\u2019.\u201cI don\u2019t know that I am making a difference,\u201d Kimmel said, \u201cbut I am going to try. I think if everybody adopts that philosophy we will actually make a difference.\u201dKimmel, a self-described Letterman \u201cstalker\u201d (he had the birthday cake and vanity number plate to prove it), kept his material for the night close to the vest but remained characteristically candid about the state of the country.\u201cI feel hopeful but not necessarily optimistic,\u201d said Kimmel, who planned to hightail it out of Washington after the show. So no quick sit-down with President Trump then?\u201cOh, I have a million questions for Donald Trump,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cI\u2019d need like three hours with him.\u201dThe next few hours, though, could very well be a Trump-free zone.\u201cNo politics tonight,\u201d Martin Short said definitively. OK then.Comedian Jimmie Walker, who hired Letterman as a writer when the future late-night host first moved to Los Angeles, said the two don\u2019t ever talk politics.\n\nJIMMY Kimmel and his wife, Molly.\u2014The Washington Post\n\n\n\u201cDave is not a political guy,\u201d said Walker, one of the honouree\u2019s oldest industry pals. \u201cHe\u2019s not that type of cat.\u201dSenator Al Franken, agrees \u2014 sort of. \u201cNo Trump jokes,\u201d Franken said. \u201cThis is about David.\u201dBut whether Letterman himself is political or not? That\u2019s up for debate, according to Franken, who joked that he tried to get the former TV weatherman to run for office in Indiana (for what position, we don\u2019t know).\u201cHe\u2019s very interested in subjects like climate change,\u201d said Franken, who also saw parallels between Kimmel\u2019s political comedy and Letterman\u2019s, pointing to the former Late Show host\u2019s Youtube-able 9/11 monologue as proof.\u201c[Letterman\u2019s] someone who takes the 60 minutes they have on TV five nights a week very seriously,\u201d Franken added.Speaking of taking things seriously, finally, here\u2019s the man of the hour himself, making jokes about some serious stuff.When asked by a reporter on the red carpet how he feels about the current state of affairs in Washington, Letterman deadpans: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something, if I can be candid \u2014 I\u2019m beginning to lose confidence in the Trump administration.\u201dBut seriously, folks: how exactly is Letterman, who famously hates being complimented, taking all this \u2014 the praise, the roasting, the fawning?\u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable,\u201d Letterman said. \u201cSo far I\u2019m having a very nice time, but I\u2019m afraid that will all diminish when people are on stage telling lies about me, and then I\u2019ll start to wither and become uncomfortable and sweat through my shirt.\u201dSo why do it?

And irrespective of the result of today\u2019s match, the visiting Sri Lankans will definitely be regarded as very special guests by the entire Pakistani nation. Though the visiting squad will be in Lahore for just above 24 hours for the match, the tremendous gesture displayed by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and the members of the touring party will definitely win the hearts and minds of tens of millions of Pakistanis who have not watched top-level international cricket action at home for years. More than eight years ago \u2014 March 3, 2009 to be exact \u2014 the bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team to the Gaddafi Stadium for a Test match, was ambushed by heavily-armed terrorists near Liberty Square. The deadly assault besides taking the lives of eight Pakistanis including six policemen, injured six Sri Lankan cricketers. The courageous driver, Mehar Mohammad Khalil, showing timely presence of mind steered the bus to the stadium and helped save the lives of the tourists who were swiftly airlifted from the venue and were soon flown back to Sri Lanka.The horrific incident proved a huge disaster for Pakistan cricket for years to come \u2014 closing the doors of international contests on the country as various cricket boards and teams declined to tour citing security concerns.In 2015, minnows Zimbabwe visited Lahore for a short limited-overs international series. Earlier this year, the final of the domestic Pakistan Super League T20 tournament was also staged in Lahore without any trouble. And the visit by World XI, featuring a few star players of international repute, for three T20s last month also went smoothly, paving the way for the Sri Lankans agreeing to play the third T20 in the provincial capital.Learning lessons from the past, top-notch security arrangements are in place this time around. Of course, nobody in the security apparatus can afford to take even slightest of a chance.\u201cArmy, Rangers and Punjab Police are making their best efforts to make sure the match is held smoothly. And for this all possible arrangements are being made,\u201d DIG Operations Dr Haider Ashraf told reporters on Saturday.\n\nA CRICKET fan holds tickets for the third T20 International.\u2014AFP\n\n\n\u201cThe [visiting] Sri Lankan security officials are quite satisfied with the security arrangements [made for the T20 match] which are of international standards,\u201d he added.As far as the on-field action is concerned, Sunday\u2019s match has very much lost its significance after Pakistan edged past Sri Lanka by two wickets in the second match on Friday night to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead.After losing the first T20 by seven wickets, the Sri Lankans fought back well in the second game where they came close to winning it in a sensational fashion before Shadab Khan changed the scenario, notching up required 12 runs in a thrill-packed last over.The Sri Lankans who produced a much improved show in the  second clash can upset Pakistan \u2014 known for their complacency \u2014 to earn a consolation victory here. Sarfraz and his men, on the other hand, must be having another ideas as they look to record another clean sweep after blanking Sri Lanka 5-0 in the ODI rubber in the UAE.After both the T20 matches staged in Abu Dhabi remained low-scoring affairs, the roaring crowd at the Gaddafi Stadium will naturally expect a high-scoring match.Interestingly, the PCB has changed the starting time of the match to 6:00pm from 7:00pm mainly because of the dew factor.Lahore has experienced smog during the last few days. Therefore, heavy dew may not fall to significantly impact the playing conditions.In the first two matches, ball has clearly dominated bat. Therefore, batsmen from one team will need to show added confidence to come out as winners in this game.From Pakistan, seasoned Shoaib Malik (51) has been the top-scorer followed by Ahmed Shehzad (49), Mohammad Hafeez (39) and Sarfraz (28). Fast-improving pacer Hasan Ali is the pick of the bowlers taking five wickets for 54 while upcoming all-rounder Fahim Ashraf has also impressed with figures of four for 22.For Sri Lanka, Danushka Gunathilaka (69), who struck half-century in the second match is the top-scorer of the series followed by Sadeera Samaraw\u00adickrama (55).While two security officials from SLC are already in Lahore, ICC security consultant Sean Norris has also reached the city. He will be responsible for the security of ICC match referee Andy Pycroft.Published in Dawn, October 29th, 2017\n", "title": "Gritty Sri Lankans return to make history", "author": "Mohammad Yaqoob"}, "1367033": {"date": "October 29, 2017", "article": "If selecting Pakistani players was food, then we have a katakut (or takatuk) on our hands. In Tests, Pakistan have handed out 229 caps, the latest being Haris Sohail. In One-day Internationals, Usman Khan was the 216th player to have received the privilege. Not all of them who were inducted made it, even though there were some outstanding talents among them. Consider Umer Akmal and Ahmed Shahzad, the latest to lose their places in the team. When they made their debuts, the great hope was that the two would anchor the next generation that was coming through. It wasn\u2019t to be. Both are now on the plate of katakut that will be swallowed whole, remembered only in passing as flavours of the moment or perhaps as analysts on the idiot box. But there were many others who lost their place despite needing more time to settle in or to sort their issues out. Below are seven batsmen who graced Pakistan cricket but were ushered out for one reason or the other, well before their Pakistan careers should have ended. \nUmer Akmal and Ahmed Shahzad have seemingly batted themselves out of contention but who were the other Pakistani batsmen whose promising careers were nipped in the bud? \nYASIR HAMEED\n\nYasir Hameed\n\n\nThere were murmurs that Yasir Hameed was addicted to naswar. Some believed the rumours, others didn\u2019t. But among the believers was the coach, Waqar Younis. Irked by having to constantly chide Hameed for his indulgences, Younis lost his cool when told that the batsman was now chewing naswar while on the crease.  The next time Hameed was padding up, Younis entered the dressing room and asked him to empty his pockets. Nothing there. Then the coach asked him to strip. Hameed did. Inside his undergarments was a packet of naswar, neatly stashed away from the prying eyes of his coach. That was the end of Yasir Hameed, a stylish batsman with a cover drive to die for but who became an advertisement for why professional sportsmen should stay away from drugs. ALI NAQVI\n\nAli Naqvi\n\n\nThe year was 1997 and South Africa had arrived in Pakistan for a tour that included three Test matches. Pakistan were searching for an opener and in came 20-year-old Ali Naqvi to partner skipper Saeed Anwar at the top of the order. Naqvi was so raw at the international level that the side match which got him selected was his first taste of first-class cricket in Pakistan (he had only played Grade-II cricket till then). The first match of the series was played in Rawalpindi. Pakistan handed debuts to three young men: Naqvi, Mohammad Ramzan and Azhar Mahmood. The first innings of the match was held together by two centuries, scored by Naqvi and Mahmood. While Mahmood batted supremely with the tail, Naqvi had been a constant as senior batmen around him came and went. The two ensured that Pakistan drew the match against a team led by Hansie Cronje and which boasted Alan Donald and Shaun Pollock in its bowling attack.But this sparkling beginning to his Test career proved to be a false start. He failed to score a 50 in the rest of the Test series, and although he was taken to tour Zimbabwe and South Africa in 1998, he didn\u2019t get a chance in the South African series and failed to impress in Zimbabwe. After playing five matches, Naqvi was dropped. He never returned to the team and another promising talent went to waste. MOHAMMAD WASIM\n\nMohammad Wasim\n\n\nThere was a time when the national selection committee was distributing Test caps like sweets, in the hopes of finding successors and backups to the batting line-up. Young Mohammad Wasim was the skipper of the Pakistan U-19 team, a technically correct batsman with style and elegance to boot. He got his chance against the visiting New Zealand team back in 1996, at the Gaddafi Stadium, after Wasim Akram pulled out of the match at the last minute. The 19-year-old\u2019s first outing bagged him a duck, but the second innings \u2014 a hundred in a losing cause \u2014 showcased the range of shots he could play in the \u2018V.\u2019 The on-drive in particular was divine as was his cover drive, both of which some believed were reminiscent of Zaheer Abbas. And while some of us believed that Pakistan\u2019s next big thing had been discovered, things didn\u2019t pan out that way. The 19-year-old got about a four-year look-in for the team, though never as a regular, but after 2000, he was summarily deemed not good enough. The numbers backed the selectors too: a Test average of just above 30 runs did not justify the bags of talent that Wasim had. His last Test was against Sri Lanka at Galle, where he scored a paltry 29 in what would become his last Test innings. Out of favour and perhaps out of luck too, Wasim headed to New Zealand in 2002 to play first-class cricket. With bags of runs under his belt, he was encouraged to return to Pakistan in 2005 so that he may be considered again for selection. But Inzamam-ul-Haq had become captain in 2003 and an air of religiosity now engulfed the team. The board and team management at the time believed that Wasim\u2019s dalliance with women fans and followers would inevitably drag the team into scandal. The captain\u2019s morality thus had the last laugh, depriving Pakistan of arguably the most aesthetic on-drives and cover drives since Zaheer Abbas graced the field.BASIT ALI\n\nBasit Ali\n\n\nHe was the second coming of Javed Miandad, while the original Miandad was still playing. On his day, he was as audacious as Miandad, could drag his team to victory from the jaws of defeat, and exasperated the opposition with his neat stroke-play. Ali was the like-for-like replacement for Miandad that Pakistan hoped would anchor the batting order for the next generation. But like many others, Ali scored a duck on his first outing against the West Indies in Port-of-Spain in 1993. The second innings saw Ali score a gritty 37 in a losing cause. Two more 50s followed in the remaining matches but over time, his inconsistency would go against him. But his debut series was also the one that arguably shaped his opinion about captain Wasim Akram as well as then vice-captain Waqar Younis. This was a time when there was no internet and news filtered through ever so slowly from other parts of the world. One morning, Pakistan woke up to news that Akram, Younis, fast-bowler Aqib Javed and leggie Mushtaq Ahmed had been arrested in Grenada. They were accompanied by two women tourists and a local man, on charges of \u201cbeing in possession of a controlled drug\u201d believed to be marijuana.Diplomatic intervention saved the Pakistanis of any major embarrassment but later on, the golden generation of Pakistan cricket became embroiled in match-fixing controversies. Ali eventually handed the following statement to a 1998 probe into match-fixing allegations: \u201cIt is absolutely false that I made some statement before Intikhab Alam confessing that I indulged in betting or match-fixing. It is also wrong that I retired because of the betting or match-fixing. As a matter of fact, circumstances created by the captain and the management were such that I had no option but to resign. Our team was divided into various groups after 1995. One comprising [Salim] Malik, Ijaz, Akram Raza, Ata-ur-Rehman and [Wasim] Akram and the other of Inzamam, myself, Mushtaq Ahmed and Waqar.\u201dBasit played his last Test in 1995 against New Zealand in New Zealand, and his last ODI in 1996 against South Africa in Sharjah. FAWAD ALAM\n\nFawad Alam\n\n\nDo you remember Graeme Hick? Yes the English batsman with 26 first-class centuries and widely considered to be a monster batsman at that level. Although Hick played 65 Test matches, his average of 31.32 was far below his 52.23 average at first-class level. The suspicion about him was that, as good a batsman as Hick was, he couldn\u2019t translate it on to international level because the standard of bowler at that level was a cut above the county level that he was used to. Many years later, in 2003, young Fawad Alam broke on to the first-class scene in Pakistan. His consistent scoring and handy left-arm spin would earn him a look-in at the national level in 2009, but as fate would have it, he never became a fixture in the squad let alone the team.In fact, under the captaincy of Misbah-ul-Haq when Pakistan\u2019s ODI team were struggling with their middle-order unable to rotate the strike, Alam remained in exile. Consider the talent that was introduced to the ODI team in Alam\u2019s place: Nasir Jamshed, Khalid Latif, Khurram Manzoor, Ahmed Shahzad, Umer Akmal, Umer Amin, Sohaib Maqsood, Mohammad Rizwan and Mohammad Nawaz to name a few. None of them could milk the bowlers for singles and doubles as effectively as Alam could. Perhaps it was Pakistan\u2019s desire to have boundary-hitters across their line-up. But it was a flawed strategy because often enough, the top would be wiped off by the opposition but not before the batsman had chewed up many overs in trying to get set. As a result, it came down to the likes of Misbah and Younis Khan to play the \u2018tuk-tuk\u2019 game to provide some respectability to the score. In the ODI game, in particular, Alam was and arguably still is a necessity. But his game isn\u2019t just restricted to ODIs, his Test average of 41.66 indicates solidity if not flamboyance. Alam was different to Graeme Hick in that he was translating his talent on to the international scene. And while Younis Khan in his brief stint as captain backed Alam, the selectors weren\u2019t convinced. Both his Test debut and his last Test came in the same year, 2009. His last Test, in New Zealand, was also Umer Amal\u2019s debut Test. The grapevine in the Karachi cricket circuit is that Alam\u2019s continued absence from the scene is because of his father \u2014 Tariq Alam made some friends in his playing days but seemingly made more enemies. Some also allege that a Karachi-Lahore rivalry is at play, with the Lahore-based PCB reluctant to hand over more Karachi-based players with responsibility. Notwithstanding the veracity of these claims, what we can all agree on is that one of Pakistan cricket\u2019s cult heroes has been hard done by. ASIM KAMAL\n\nAsim Kamal\n\n\nAt a time when Pakistan were struggling for some guts and consistency to the lower middle-order, they discovered Asim Kamal.  The year was 2003 and a gritty 99 on Test debut at the Gaddafi Stadium against South Africa proved that a special player had just entered the fray. He manoeuvred the field like Salim Malik, finding singles and doubles at will, and before the opposition knew it, Kamal was already batting on 30. The tour to India in 2005 confirmed that he was Pakistan\u2019s Wall. In a very short span of time, Kamal made a cult following. But Kamal was also a bit of a purist \u2014 given that he had established his credentials, he didn\u2019t take too kindly to the selectors putting him in the team for one series and dropping him the next. His last Test innings was also in Lahore, against England in 2005, where he scored a paltry five runs. A career average of 37.33 with no centuries in two years bear testament to another what-if story in Pakistan cricket. The worst part? So depressed was Kamal at his exclusion, at the Board, and at the system that he took a hiatus from cricket to rediscover his love for the game. He retired in 2015.ZULQARNAIN HAIDER\n\nZulqarnain Haider\n\n\nNever has a Pakistani hero gone out of limelight as quickly as Zulqarnain Haider did. The young wicketkeeper-batsman turned into a heartthrob overnight back in 2010 as he replaced Kamran Akmal in the line-up at Edgbaston and played a gritty innings of 88 in the second innings of his Test debut.The wicket-keeping mess seemed to have been resolved. But this was the summer of shame, as Pakistan cricket was buffeted by news that three of its superstars and match-winners were involved in fixing proceedings of a match. There was anxiety, there was fear, and there was suspicion. While Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were banned and put in jail, it was Haider whose career seemed to have nosedived the most.  Selectors believed he had more wicket-keeping potential than Kamran Akmal and stuck by him for a one-day series against South Africa in November. Midway through the series, however, Haider packed his bags, left the team hotel, and went to the United Kingdom in search of asylum. Nobody quite knows what transpired but the murmurs were that bookies had approached him and threatened him of dire consequences if he didn\u2019t relent. Much later, though, Haider said in an interview that he had \u201cspecific issues with a few players whom I won\u2019t like to name.\u201dHaider made his debut in the August of 2010. His international career was over in four months.The writer is a member of staff.

A skirmish erupted near the town of Semdinli, in the province of Hakkari that borders Iraq, after the security forces spotted a group of rebels who were allegedly preparing to launch an attack, the military said. Six soldiers and two government-paid village guards aiding troops in the fight against the rebels were killed in the fighting. An Interior Ministry statement said 19 rebels were killed in the clash as well as a wider, air power-backed operation launched to catch the militants. Separately, nine rebels were killed in a clash in the province of Tunceli, while three others were killed in Sirnak province, the ministry said. The rebels of the Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party, or PKK, have waged a three-decade-long insurgency in southeastern Turkey. The conflict has killed tens of thousands of people. The group is considered a terror organisation by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. Violence flared again in 2015 after the collapse of a two-year peace process. In a speech in Ankara, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan vowed to press ahead with operations against the PKK.\u201cWe will continue our struggle against them, until these terrorists are annihilated and are gone,\u201d Erdogan said.

The offer was made by a six-member Chinese delegation led by Thomas Wang to City Mayor Wasim Akhtar during a meeting at his office on Sunday. Thomas Wang, who represents Chinese company Eco-Bus, has reportedly said that the company would also gift two such buses that would reach the city within two months. The buses are being sent here so that these could be tried and evaluated on the roads here and local staffers \u2014 drivers, mechanics and other related people \u2014 could be trained, he added. Briefing the media persons after the meeting, the mayor said that situation / condition of the public transport in the city was pathetic and if this project, which would be evaluated and examined, was materialised, it could solve the transport issues of Karachiites to a great extent. He said that two buses, which had been gifted by the Chinese company, would arrive in the city in a next few weeks so that these could be examined in the local conditions. He said neither these eco-friendly buses would cause the air pollution, nor would create noise pollution. The imported fossil fuel would also not be used so precious foreign exchange could also be saved, he added. He said that under the project over 500 stations would be established at different locations in the city where these buses could be charged. Once charged these buses could travel approximately 280 kilometres. He said that the Chinese company had offered various proposals: they could bring in the investment and operate the buses themselves, they could work in a joint venture \u2014 with the government or the local transport \u2014 or could just sell the buses. He said that all these proposals would be examined to see which one was more beneficial for the general public. The mayor said that all the mega cities around the globe had urban mass transit systems, but leave alone the mass transit system, here in the metropolis unfortunately did not exists a fully functional public transport system, owing to which people suffered and were forced to travel in buses and minibuses that were in dilapidated condition. He said that the Chinese company was in contact with the government. He said that he had assured the delegation that the civic agency would extend all assistance so that this vital eco-friendly project, which could solve the transport issues of, and provide relief to, the people, could be implemented, hopefully soon.Published in Dawn, October 30th, 2017\n", "title": "Chinese firm offers 2,000 electric buses for Karachi under $600m project", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter"}, "1364624": {"date": "Updated Oct 19, 2017 11:33pm", "article": "When we came up with the idea of cycling around the Shandong Peninsula, our friends told us, \u201cYou guys are junooni (fanatics).\u201d But we were determined to complete this dream cycling tour of ours. The objective was straightforward: To explore China, find out whether it is actually difficult for expats to travel freely in the country as portrayed in the international media, know whether the Chinese really love Pakistanis the way we have been taught throughout our lives, and finally, to defy the general perception that Pakistanis lack the spirit of adventure. We chose the Shandong Peninsula because of its historical importance, attractive scenery, diverse cuisine, and rich culture. Besides, it was close to Qingdao where we live. \n\nStarting point: Ocean University of China. - All photos by the authors\n\n\nThe Shandong Peninsula is located in the Shandong province in eastern China, between the Bohai Sea to the north and the Yellow Sea to the south. The peninsula\u2019s territory comprises three major cities of  the Shandong province: Qingdao in the southwest, Yantai in the north and centre, and Weihai at the eastern tip. Besides these three prefecture-level cities, the peninsula has many county-level cities and villages as well.We opted for bicycles because of their simplicity, slowness of pace, and the worm\u2019s-eye view they allow a rider to have. On a bicycle, one does not just observe the scenery but gets absorbed by it. For students like us, bicycling is an economic, healthy and environment-friendly way of travelling as well.\n\nChaoshi (Chinese for supermarket).\n\n\nThe tour was a completely new experience for us. Even though we had explored Qingdao and its districts on bicycle before, we had never done a long distance cycling tour prior to this. It was imperative that we not allow our inexperience to triumph and so, in order to make our trip safe and sound, we arranged all necessary equipment. We took with us our cycling toolkits, some extra tyre tubes, an air pump, rain coats, air pillows, etc. We set off on April 22, 2017. We planned the trip as a point A to point A tour, starting from our university, Ocean University of China, in Qingdao and returning right where we began on May 5, 2017. In the course of our journey, we passed by more than 12 prefecture-level and county-level cities: Qingdao, Jimo, Laixi, Zhaoyuan, Longkou, Penglai, Changdao, Yantai, Weihai, Rongcheng, Rushan, and Haiyang. We rode through the difficult terrains of rural Shandong as well as on the smooth roads along the coasts of the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea, covering a distance of more than 1,000 kilometres. \n\nFuelling just before the high altitude biking in rural Longkou.\n\n\nInitially, it was tough to cycle on the relatively hilly roads of Shandong with the considerable amount of weight of the equipment loaded on our bikes. But our stamina gradually grew, along with the strength in our thighs. Jimo was the first stopover. It is a county-level city close to Qingdao. One can take either the general traffic routes or the Yangkou Tunnel which is 3.8 kilometres long. We took the general traffic routes which run mostly through the main city area, but are often hampered by numerous traffic signals. It is a small city, but is home to some classical architecture and big shopping malls.The next destination was Laixi. We followed the rural traffic routes to get to Liaxi, which were often crowded with heavy vehicles, but one got to see the rural life. \n\nAn evening of traditional dance and music with elderly Chinese in Laixi.\n\n\nLaixi is known for its slower pace of life. In the evening, residents can be seen fishing and exercising at the Moon Lake Park.We also spent an evening with the elderly Chinese exercising in the park. They welcomed us to participate in their exercise activity which included traditional music and dance. On our third day, we arrived in Zhaoyuan, another county-level city located on the seashore of the Bohai Sea. We had again taken the rural traffic routes but encountered light rain on our way. Riding in the rain was quite a novel experience, but the best part was that we came across so many people who offered help. They gave us umbrellas, raincoats, and asked us to take shelter in their shops. Some also offered us hot drinking water. \n\nA glittering bridge in Zhaoyuan.\n\n\n\nMaking our way to Zhaoyuan through a village.\n\n\nWe learnt that drinking hot water is an old tradition here in China and is believed to be a source of good health. Be it summer or winter, one can see people carrying their own bottle of hot water. In Zhaoyuan, what we found particularly fascinating were its magnificent architecture and scintillating night views. At night, one can see bridges and high-rise buildings showered in beautiful, colourful lights, around a lake located just outside the main city. One can also find numerous parks and gardens within the city which make Zhaoyuan  green and tourist-friendly.\n\nA village near Nanshan.\n\n\n\nIt was a tough ride making it to the top.\n\n\nWe rode to Longkou next. Along the route, one can\u2019t miss the Nanshan Mountain Tourist Area. It is the first-ever AAAA-rated scenic area in the province - a rating that\u2019s given only to some of the most important cultural and historical places or buildings in China. The main attraction here is the Great Buddha. Weighing 380 tonnes and measuring 38.66 meters, it is the largest tin bronze sitting Buddha statue in the world.We rode up to the top of Nanshan on bicycle and it proved to be the toughest ride of our whole tour. The tourists were amazed when they discovered that we managed to ride up to the top on bicycle. We took a less familiar route to get to the summit in order to see and explore the rural life and the villages located around the Nanshan Mountain. Throughout the ride, we passed by quaint villages and stunning sceneries.  \n\nElderly Chinese working in the fields near Nanshan.\n\n\nWe noticed numerous elderly villagers working in the fields all day long. We learnt that since the youth is increasingly moving to the cities for education and employment, their parents and grandparents are left to tend the fields.Another observation we made was the community involvement in the protection of forests, water conservation, and tourism promotion. We came across many locals dressed in uniforms, tasked by the government for these purposes.Longkou is quite mountainous in the south and in the first half of our journey, we had to ride through the difficult terrains of rural Longkou. The second half of the journey started from Penglai and was mostly through the urban areas of Penglai, Yantai, and Weihai, and along the smooth coasts of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. \n\nEn route to Penglaige Scenic Area.\n\n\n\nA Qing Dynasty iron cannon of the First Opium War displayed in Penglaige, Penglai.\n\n\n\nHistoric carvings of words and poetry in Penglaige.\n\n\nIn Penglai, we spent two full days because there is so much to do and see. The special thing about Penglai is the Penglai Pavilion Scenic Area. One will find here ancient city walls, iron cannons, some small and medium-sized temples, an ancient light house, and lots of historic carvings of words and poetry. The main point of interest for us was the fort-like structure that occupies the mountain on the north of the shore. One can also take a cable car to the adjacent cliff with great aerial views of the Changdao Islands.\n\nHighlight of the day: Penglaige Tourism Area in Penglai.\n\n\n\nChangdao Island, a wonderful place famous for its rocky beaches.\n\n\n\nCulture and beaches, China has it all.\n\n\nChangdao Island is a wonderful place to see around Penglai. It is known for its rocky beaches and picturesque cliffs. The island is regularly served by both passenger and vehicle roll-on/roll-off ferry from Penglai and one can take their bikes on the ferry as well. But in order to do so, one needs to inform them beforehand because sometimes they may not allow it. We arrived in Yantai after riding along the scenic coast of Bohai Sea. Yantai is one of the major cities and the largest fishing port in the province. The best thing to do in Yantai is gaze at the Yantai skyline dotted with high-rise buildings, besides lying idly on the sandy beaches. \n\nA glimpse of the Yantai business hub from the coast of Bohai Sea.\n\n\nOur stay in Yantai was short but eventful. Our four star hotel\u2019s management asked us to take our bicycles to our bedrooms because they thought they wouldn\u2019t be safe in the car parking.Later, while in a park,  we unknowingly entered an army-controlled area adjacent to the park. The security officers inquired about us and let us go when they found out we are expats and exploring Shandong on bikes and had entered the place mistakenly. They dealt with us in a very friendly manner and asked us if we needed any help. We got to see the friendly and supportive attitude of Chinese officials in all the cities and villages we visited.\n\nMet a biker from Dalian.\n\n\nEn route to Weihai, we came across a Chinese biker who suggested that we visit the Yangma Island which is a few kilometres off the main Yantai-Weihai route. We crossed a long bridge and arrived on Yangma Island. The island is round-shaped and we actually rode around the entire island in a few hours. The place is mostly famous for horseback riding and antique horse-drawn carriage rides. \n\nBuzkashi demonstration in Weihai by young Mongol horsemen.\n\n\nFor Weihai, we dedicated two full days. It is the easternmost prefecture-level city of the province and an important seaport. The major landscapes of Weihai are the Happiness Gate and the Weihai International Bathing Beach, but for us the highlight of the day was the Huaxiacheng Tourist Scenic Area. It is a huge complex with a great number of tourist spots and activities. One can find a mixture of gardens, temples, traditional architecture, statues, museums, and shows. \n\nA glimpse of classical architecture in Weihai.\n\n\nThe most surreal part of the day was when we got to experience a level 7 earthquake in a special simulation room in the Weihai Air Defense Education Museum.It is a moveable wooden compartment which can house around 20 people. During the simulation, one can hold the steel frames fixed inside the room in order to keep one\u2019s balance. It was an absolutely thrilling undertaking. The presentation is part of a series of different shows meant for public education.\n\nExperienced a Level 7 earthquake at the Weihai Air Defence Education Museum.\n\n\nThe longest ride of our tour started from Weihai and ended in Rongcheng. We rode over 150 kilometres that day and even rode during the night for a couple of hours. Rongcheng is one of the most stunning county-level cities in Shandong. The must-see places here are Chengshantou and the Swan Lake. In order to get to Chengshantou, one needs to ride up the mountainous region in the extreme east of Rongcheng, which was a really challenging task. Chengshantou is located at the easternmost part of the Chengshan Mountain. It is also referred to as the Cape of Good Hope, as it is the first spot in China where people see the sun rise in the morning. An intriguing thing about Chengshantou is that one can go to the seaside from a hill via a deep, long and picturesque cave. \n\nSwan Lake is an ideal habitat for Whooper Swans.\n\n\nAnother must-see place in Rongcheng is the Swan Lake. It is an ideal habitat for swans that migrate from Siberia to this small fishing village to spend the winter. While making it to our final destination, Haiyang, we passed by the small but striking city of Rushan. It is a county-level city that borders Yantai to the north and looks out to the Yellow Sea to the south. In Haiyang, we were forced by the heavy rain to spend an extra day, but we managed to leave on the third day when it was lightly drizzling. The special thing about Haiyang is that it is strategically located in the centre of the prime tourist trio of Qingdao, Yantai and Weihai. One can travel to all these three major cities of the Shandong province directly from Haiyang. So our final ride was also from Haiyang back to Qingdao.\n\nWe did it! At Ocean University of China after completing our dream cycling tour.\n\n\nThroughout our journey, we were warmly welcomed by everyone we came across. The question on everyone\u2019s lips was, \u201cNi shi na gou ren (Where are you from)?\u201d The moment we said, \u201cWo shi Bajisitan ren (We are from Pakistan),\u201d their response was: \u201cHuanying lai dao Zhongguo, women shi feichang hao de pengyou (Welcome to China, we are very good friends).\u201d What we experienced was very different from what the international media says about China. Everyone including law enforcement officials were extremely supportive and helpful. We wrapped up our tour with a newfound determination that this surely can\u2019t be the end. We would really like to see all of China on two wheels one day. We strongly encourage everyone reading this to come and experience firsthand the diverse culture, economic prowess and the irresistible charm of China and its people.\nHave you travelled to places that are not commonly visited by tourists?

It was the Chinese Minister of Environmental Protection, Li Ganjie, stating at a news conference that a strengthened environmental protection system would eventually benefit the country\u2019s economic development. He was responding to public expectations to improve air quality. He also told reporters \u201cWe are fully aware of the problems we are facing. Coal accounts for a high proportion of the overall energy mix.\u201d Also, \u201cwe have too many commodities transported by trucks. Some companies avoid emission-control measures. Some local governments are not enforcing measures from the central government.\u201d He said that China will strive to comply fully with its own air quality standards by 2035.Resolve, perseverance, and determination are words that I would use to describe the Chinese response to tackling air pollution. It was not always this way. The Chinese (and the world) had a very bad understanding of the effect of air pollution on health, as recently as 20 years ago. \nChina is a great example of a country acting in a focused way to reduce air pollution.\nInitially, acid rain (from poor air quality) affected crops and damaged buildings in the 1980s in China, becoming much more prevalent by the 1990s. This rang the alarm bells for the Chinese government to take air quality seriously. The impact of air quality on human health was only just being understood better at the time. Some remarkable efforts followed, including the Chinese putting in place strict sulphur-emissions regulations for their coal power plants, realising that this was an important cause of their pollution. Due to domestic demand, this created a huge market for flue gas desulphurization technology, which the Chinese took on, significantly reducing the global price for this technology. Indeed, according to an industry report, by 2009, China was operating 379,000 MW of scrubbers compared to only 130,000 MW in the US. China is also the largest supplier of many types of air pollution-control equipment and several Chinese companies are the world\u2019s leading suppliers of electrostatic precipitators.  The air quality problem has continued to get worse resulting in the Chinese putting in place even stricter standards for coal plant technology (such as super critical plants) and also investing in other renewable technologies. They also continue to cancel planned and under-construction coal power plants. For example, in January 2017, China cancelled 103 planned and under-construction coal power plants, amounting to 120 GW capacity (yes, gigawatts, ie 120,000 MW). Air quality management is a continuous battle in China, given the extent of locked-in coal-based power generation, keeping China on its toes \u2014 even more so these days as the world, and China\u2019s own citizens, better understand the effect of poor air quality on their health. To their great credit, the Chinese keep this issue front and centre on many fronts, including their active championing of the Paris Climate Agreement, shifting away from a position of highlighting their low carbon emissions per capita and the \u2018right\u2019 of all Chinese people to own a (petrol-powered) car. And it is not about their citizens losing out either, but rather about doing things differently.Indeed, China is shifting deliberately towards an electric car future for its citizens. In doing so, China puts itself clearly in a high moral position, advocating for a better quality of life for its own citizens, as well as a global champion. At the same time, Chinese industry continues to actively help bring down the cost of both air pollution-control technologies and certain renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaic cells, making it a market leader. China is a great example of a country acting in a focused way to reduce air pollution, prompted by economic and health concerns, but it also shows how difficult it is to clean up if it is left too late. Today, with CPEC, Pakistan is poised for greater economic growth. Can\u2019t we also ask China for help on air quality, under the CPEC umbrella, so we can learn from them and avoid the problems that they face today? We might even be able to partner with Chinese industries to produce the pollution-control technologies we need to help control our own air quality.A few obvious areas on which to request help from China include the setting up of an air quality-monitoring system for our major cities, so we can actually monitor the pollution. We also need to strengthen the courses in our universities on air pollution, perhaps by partnering with the Chinese, so we can build Pakistani capacity to understand the problem, analyse the sources of pollution and develop the policies and measures to address it. Capacity building at the state and the national level of our government officials is important, so they can better develop and enforce appropriate environmental standards, which are the main policy tool for protecting human health, if applied properly. China consciously put in place training programmes, for not just its environment professionals, but for all municipal officials, on topics such as Strategic Environmental Assessment, to raise awareness of environmental issues. I know this, because I was one of the course lecturers, and the Chinese translated one of my books for teaching purposes. Learning about the different roles of the national government and the local governments in improving air quality would also be useful, given that in Pakistan, the 18th Amendment devolves the responsibility for environmental management to the provincial level, and rightly so, as they are closest to the ground. Just these four bits of primarily intellectual help from China could yield us a lot, such as a future in which we (and our children) could be breathing clean air.The World Health Organisation estimated that the mortality rate in Pakistan attributable to household and ambient pollution per 100,000 population was 87.2 in 2012. With a population of 177.9 million in 2012, that means that 155,000 deaths that year in Pakistan were attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution alone. Compare this number with the 62,574 people who died in Pakistan from terrorist violence between 2003 and Oct 22, 2017, with the worst year on record as 2009, with 11,704 fatalities, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal. When will we feel the pressure that it is time to act on air quality to protect the health (and life) of Pakistani citizens?

The aviation regulator has issued directives for PIA to strengthen, improve and strictly implement its in-house codes, trainings, laws governing the crew. The sources said that pilot Aziz had invited a Chinese female passenger in the cockpit during the Tokyo-Beijing flight (PK-853) on May 8 and directed the co-pilot to go out of it. They said the woman remained inside the cockpit for a considerable period of time.  One of the passengers, who had witnessed the woman entering the cockpit, had videotaped the entire episode by his cell phone and tried to get the versions of the woman and crew members about it. But, after failing to get their versions, he had uploaded the video on social media. The video had gone viral instantly.  Responding to media queries on the video, a PIA representative had said that pilot Aziz was being grounded and an inquiry would be conducted.  The sources said that following a series of hijacking incidents during the fourth quarter of the previous century entry of unauthorised people in the cockpit, particularly during the flight, had been banned.Published in Dawn, October 23rd, 2017\n", "title": "Violation of air safety rule: CAA yet to take action against PIA pilot", "author": "Bhagwandas"}, "1365844": {"date": "October 24, 2017", "article": "BEIRUT: At least 10 members of a small jihadist faction linked to the militant Islamic State group were killed on Monday by suspected Israeli air strikes in southern Syria, a monitor said.The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the strikes hit the town of Sahm al-Jolan in the west of Daraa province.The monitor said 10 fighters from the Jaish Khaled Bin Walid group were killed, along with two women believed to be the wives of fighters from the faction.

People with eye and skin irritation as well as breathing problems started heading to hospitals. Later, it was discovered that this heavy thick curtain was not a natural occurrence, but smog. The reasons were several including trans-boundary smoke emitted from India due to stubble burning mixed with the smoke from firecrackers burst on Diwali. In images released by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), some crops were seen burning in Pakistan as well. Other reasons included the dust from several development projects and, of course, traffic congestion and burning of third-rate fuels by small industries. As the same time approaches this year, there isn\u2019t much information for the public or experts to analyse the situation. The Punjab Environment Protection Department (EPD) does not seem to be prepared for any emergency situation although officials claim to be working on it. Their air quality machines are not fully functional. EPD Labs Director Tauqeer Ahmed Qureshi says heavy duty machines needed for measuring particulate matter and noxious gases are not only highly sensitive, but also extremely expensive. \u201cWe have limited finance and human resources,\u201d he admits. \u201cOur last tender for the instruments was for Rs40 million per machine, while maintenance would cost Rs5 million every year per station.\u201d Even if the three instruments they have were working perfectly, he says, they could get readings only for two fixed areas every day. The city needs at least 15 to 20 stations. \u201cIn every location, there are so many factors: proximity of industries, traffic congestion, time of the year, wind direction, temperature, cloud cover etc. How can we give a daily mean reading in such a situation?\u201d he asks. The annual cost of just maintaining an air quality monitoring system is much more than the department\u2019s annual budget. The department\u2019s development budget for 2017-18 is Rs540 million, said Deputy Director (Development) Tahir. According to a joint research report, titled \u2018Shared Environmental Concerns between India and Pakistan\u2019, by environmental lawyer Ahmed Rafay Alam and Sanjay Upadhyay, the high cost of environmental sampling, which is the basis for any conviction before environmental tribunals, means that testing is seldom carried out. At the same time, innovative enforcement mechanisms such as pollution charges and self-monitoring rules have not yet been utilised. Meanwhile, the department is blamed for wasting the equipment it has. Ten years ago, the three machines were acquired from a Japanese firm. A decade later, these instruments have rusted, as the EPD admits itself. If they were used, as officials claim they were, no one knows the air quality readings received as they were never made public. \u201cWhatever the readings are, the public has a right to know,\u201d says Alam. \u201cIt is important for people to know the kind of air they are breathing.\u201d \u201cWe did not upload the results because sometimes knowledge can be an annoyance rather than benefit,\u201d justifies Tauqeer Qureshi. Meanwhile, to manage costs, he says a more compact German replacement has been found which costs around Rs15m per machine with Rs0.5m maintenance cost per annum for each machine. \u201cRight now the EPD has six stations -- Sahiwal, Sheikhupura, Faisalabad, Chakwal and Lahore, and one mobile. But they are all in the process of being set up,\u201d he adds. Qureshi also revealed that corruption has left the EPD in a bad state. \u201cIt was never revealed officially, but currently not a single factory is considered fit.\u201d \u201cThe meters should be up and running at all costs,\u201d Alam says. \u201cBut in the long term, other initiatives can also be taken, for example replacing carbon emitting industries, taking action where cars are concerned, etc.\u201d Coal emitting industries are expected to spread much more air pollution. Instead, biomass industries are a better option, researchers say. Alam\u2019s research report also indicates that besides political interest and increased budget support being integral to a solution, independent provincial frameworks for climatic and environmental issues are needed to be devised, related institutions staffed with trained people, and programmes managed and monitored. \u201cWe need to work out if it\u2019s only trans-boundary or just a drop in temperature worsening the situation. \nWithout proper data how can we make nuanced policies?\u201d he questioned.Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2017\n", "title": "Is Punjab ready to tackle smog this year?", "author": "Xari Jalil"}, "1367234": {"date": "Updated Nov 29, 2016 01:45am", "article": "Shafiquddin is lost in thought. He is sitting on a wooden bench at the corner of a potholed road in Benazir Colony, a part of Karachi\u2019s Orangi Town, staring absent-mindedly at everyone who walks by. The area appears poor, quiet and desolate. No industrial or commercial concerns operate here. Only a few scattered shops dot the streets. Local residents mostly stay within their own neighbourhood. No cars are seen driving around, no buses seen plying in Benazir Colony.  When Shafiquddin begins to talk, others around him shout him down. No matter what party runs the country, they say, the people of Orangi Town will always be neglected. He shrugs them off and continues: in 1974, he moved with his family to Karachi from Chittagong, Bangladesh, and found a job at a factory near the then recently developed Port Qasim seaport (as did many others who had migrated with him). He never had any trouble getting to work because his employer always sent buses to pick up the workers. Those days are long gone. The residents of Benazir Colony either have to walk for a couple of kilometres to get to a bus stand or they hail an autorickshaw to go to a nearby main road where they can find public buses. A few years ago, the provincial government started running buses that connected the colony with the rest of the city but those ran on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and have stopped operating since gas stocks have run out. Those who can find buses more frequently and easily than the residents of Benazir Colony have other complaints.  \n\nTraffic congestion near Nazimabad, Karachi | Tahir Jamal, White Star\n\n\nOn an unusually hot day last month, Maryam Zulfiqar, a 25-year-old student, is riding a bus to go to a private institute on Karachi\u2019s Tipu Sultan Road where she studies Arabic language. She left her home in Future Colony within the city\u2019s southeastern working-class area, Landhi, at 8 am. It normally takes her at least an hour \u2013 provided there are no traffic jams \u2013 to complete the 15-kilometre journey. At 5 pm, she will travel back: same route, same distance but in the opposite direction. Also read: We are destroying Karachi's greatest defense against ocean stormsZulfiqar is angry at the way bus drivers behave. They show very little patience, both in their driving and in dealing with passengers, and are not helpful when you make a complaint, she says. She is also unhappy about the lack of safety on buses and the unavailability of seats, especially for women, children and the elderly. \u201cSometimes so many people get on the bus that the men start pushing their way into the women\u2019s section,\u201d says Zulfiqar. In the past few years, she claims, bus owners have also reduced the number of seats reserved for women. \u201cWe find no place to sit and there is nobody to assist us,\u201d she says angrily. \u201cThe elderly and children are also not considered important passengers because the buses have to slow down to let them get on and off.\u201d Clara has mastered the art of negotiating these problems, perfected over years of travelling on public transport in Karachi. In her mid-fifties now, she climbs on to a bus on a recent weekday with an ageless swiftness and finds a seat in the women\u2019s section. She has been travelling on the same route for almost 17 years \u2014 taking a bus from Malir Cantt, close to the Jinnah International Airport, heading to the Pakistan Air Force Museum on Sharae Faisal where she works as a janitor.\nThere are, indeed, too many vehicles on the roads \u2014 even when the\nnumber of buses has decreased.\nClara, however, makes only part of her journey on the bus. She uses either an autorickshaw or a motorcycle rickshaw to travel the eight to 10 kilometres between her home and Malir Cantt. The time she requires for her two-way daily journey, about 37 kilometres long, depends, mostly, on the way the bus moves. \u201cIf [the driver] keeps slowing down at every small stop then we keep getting stuck in traffic which results in me reaching my destination in 45 minutes,\u201d she says. The bus that Clara takes every day picks up commuters from Mohammad Khan Colony in Orangi Town, located on the north-western part of Karachi, moves across the city diagonally and finally stops at Hazrat Bilal Colony, the largest neighbourhood in the Korangi area to the south-east. The bus makes stops at several major areas, including Nazimabad, Hassan Square, Karsaz, Drigh Road and Malir. It drives past the traffic and mayhem of Quaidabad, moves through Landhi and lurches towards its last stop in Korangi. Travelling this entire 31-kilometre route takes at least two hours. Clara is happy, though. \u201cIf it were not for this bus, how would I get to work?\u201d she asks with a smile. A mother of seven and a grandmother to \u201cnumerous grandchildren\u201d, she needs to keep working and feels blessed that the bus helps her do that, costing only 30-40 rupees for a round trip. Strikes and political unrest in the city highlight the importance of buses even further for commuters like Clara who then either have to stay home or use costlier means of transport such as autorickshaws and taxis. Transporters keep their vehicles off the roads in uncertain situations because Karachi has a long and tragic history of transport-related violence. A college girl\u2019s death in 1985 after she was hit by a bus and the subsequent riots, in which scores were killed and hundreds of vehicles set on fire, was the first instance. \n\nPassengers climb on to the sides of an overcrowded bus in Karachi | Tahir jamal, White star\n\n\nKarachi has an estimated population of nearly 24 million, according to a study done by the Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) in 2012. The city has nearly 6,457 buses of various sizes operating on 150 routes. It also has 2,715 contract carriages, buses and luxury coaches that organisations and individuals can hire for temporary transportation, the study adds. And these are not the only modes of transport on the city\u2019s roads: minibuses, taxi cabs, autorickshaws, multiple-seat motorcycle rickshaws, private cars, motorcycles, school buses, private vans, ambulances, tankers, mini-trucks \u2014 anything that can run on an engine attached to wheels can be seen plying in Karachi. When architect and urban planner Arif Hasan and engineer Mansoor Raza came out with a study, Karachi: The Transport Crisis, in January 2015, one of their findings appeared counter-intuitive. In a city clogged with all different kinds of vehicles, they found the number of public transport buses having declined between 2011 and 2014 \u2014 from 22,313 to 12,399. Out of the buses that still exist, they write, only 9,527 are operative. Others remain off the road because of the CNG shortage, lack of funding and absence of security. \u201c \u2026 Due to this decline, people are forced to travel on the roofs of buses which is, strictly speaking, illegal and [they have to] wait at bus stops for long periods to get a ride,\u201d the study states.\n\nUtility relocation for a Bus Rapid Transit system in Karachi |Tahir Jamal, White Star\n\n\nKarachi: The Transport Crisis explores all the difficulties commuters face: \u201c \u2026 Excessive time spent in travelling and waiting for buses, travelling standing, travelling on bus rooftops, suffering injuries, being forced to leave the bus before reaching their destination for one reason or the other, harassment of women commuters, damage to attire, non-standardisation of bus fares, and a fear of the gas cylinder (which is placed within the bus) exploding.\u201d It also states that traffic is \u201cbecoming unmanageable and its congestion and the air and noise pollution [have] become detrimental to the health of its commuting public.\u201d There are, indeed, too many vehicles on the roads \u2014 even when the number of buses has decreased. According to the transport and communication department at the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, there were around 3.127 million registered vehicles in Karachi by December 31, 2013. And this number is increasing at a staggering rate: 283,277 vehicles were registered only in 2013 out of which 71 per cent were motorcycles. In 2015 alone, 1,000 motorcycles were registered per day, says Hasan. While the number of vehicles on Karachi\u2019s roads is increasing by leaps and bounds, the number of traffic police personnel has remained stagnant. There are 3,200 policemen on traffic duty in the city when it needs an \u201cadditional 5,000 to regulate traffic\u201d according to the authors of Karachi: The Transport Crisis. Also read: The dismal state of public spaces in PakistanThe other problem arising out of the number of vehicles is environmental pollution. In theory, every vehicle has to get a fitness certificate from the Vehicular Emission Control Programme (VECP), started by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa). In practice, these certificates are either forged or procured by bribing government officials. The lack of coordination among government agencies, however, ensures that no one gets caught and punished for driving a vehicle without a fitness certificate. In any case, a strict enforcement of the fitness standards will create more problems than it will solve, at least in the short run. Quoted in Karachi: The Transport Crisis, a senior traffic police officer remarks: if the requirement for a fitness certificate \u201cis implemented, most public transport vehicles will be off the roads and the poor will suffer.\u201d\n\"This is a question of city planning. Not just of transport planning,\u201d\nsays Arif Hasan.\nThe JICA study insists the answer to all these problems is a system of transport that can help people transit from one part of the city en masse to another. Karachi, JICA's study says, is one of the few metropolitan cities in the world without a mass transit system. If it continues to expand at its current rate, it will become the second largest city in the world by 2030 with Tokyo, Japan, at number one \u2014 in other words, the largest city without a mass transit system. Everyone \u2013 from the officials at the mass transit department at Karachi\u2019s Civic Centre, which houses the offices of the city administration, to architects, urban planners, commuters and transporters \u2013 agrees that there is an \u201cimmediate\u201d need for Karachi to have a smooth, sustainable and feasible mass transit system. \n\nCommuters board overcrowded buses and autorickshaws along the route of Green Line in Karachi | Tahir Jamal, White Star\n\n\nThe Civic Centre opposite Hassan Square in Gulshan-e-Iqbal area is a concrete jungle. A large multi-storey complex consisting of interconnected buildings seems to be sagging under the weight of the problems of a rapidly growing city. Away from its main entrance, approached through congested alleys blocked by motorcycles and visitors, is the entrance to a building where Karachi\u2019s mass transit department is situated in a corner on the sixth floor.On February 3, 2016, this department made an announcement in newspapers that Karachi will soon have a mass transit system comprising a Green Line, an Orange Line, a Yellow Line and a Red Line \u2014 as part of a mass transit development plan JICA devised in 2012. The proposed system includes the construction of six Bus Rapid Transits (BRTs), two Metro Rapid Transits (MRTs) and the revival of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) which was originally established in 1964. Fazal Khatri, the director of the mass transit department since 2013, sits in his office, signing documents and answering his phone, which buzzes every few minutes. A man of nearly 35 years of experience and nearing retirement, Khatri says his department recently gave a presentation to Sindh Governor Dr Ishratul Ebad on the ongoing and proposed public transport projects. In order to ensure these projects benefit the people of the city, he says, public hearings have been organised to elicit the point of view of the \u201creal\u201d stakeholders. \u201cWe want to know what the public would do differently or if the current plan even suits them,\u201d Khatri says. \n\nPassengers sit on top of crowded buses near the construction site of the Orange Line in Karachi | Tahir Jamal, White Star\n\n\t\t\t\n\nTwo out of the six proposed BRTs are at early stages of implementation: utility relocation for the Orange Line has started in front of the Jinnah University for Women in North Nazimabad. Water pipes, gas lines and electric wires are being relocated to facilitate construction for the BRT which will run right in the centre of the existing roads. The shortest of the six proposed lines, the 2.2 kilometre Orange Line will begin near the Board Office in Nazimabad, heading northwest towards the Town Municipal Office in Orangi. The Sindh government will fund this entire line, estimated to cost 2.4 billion rupees and expected to benefit 50,000 people a day. The deadline for its completion is the end of 2016. The construction of a 17-kilometre elevated Green Line is also underway after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif inaugurated it late last month. It starts at Guru Mandir \u2013 in the south of the city \u2013 and goes all the way to the K-Electric Power House in Surjani Town in North Karachi. The Green Line intersects the Orange Line near the Board Office and is expected to benefit 300,000 passengers every day. Funded entirely by the federal government, it is expected to cost 16.6 billion rupees. \n\"I don\u2019t think it is feasible to move all these people\u201d. Arif Hasan\nremains pessimistic about the KCR\u2019s revival.\nThe 26-kilometre long Yellow Line is in the planning stage and will be built under a public-private partnership. Khatri says an agreement will be signed soon with the China National Electric Company \u2013 the private partner in the project \u2013 which will be responsible for arranging 40 per cent of the funding. The Sindh government will provide the rest of the money. Khatri expects the project to be completed by 2018, though this looks ambitious given that construction work has not even started. The remaining projects under JICA's proposal have not entered the planning phase.  Even those which are well underway may fizzle out considering Karachi\u2019s troubled development history. Political interference and the unavailability of money, either together or separately, have been the most significant stumbling blocks in almost all previously failed public transport projects. And these two factors can still lead to a similar outcome. When asked about the progress of the mass transit projects being currently planned and built, Khatri says he sees no major obstacles in their way, at least for now. Everything, he says, is \u201cgoing smoothly.\u201d The KCR, too, once worked smoothly but then ran aground due to financial constraints. It became a full circle of 44 kilometres in 1970 and connected Karachi\u2019s four main work areas: the port, the Sindh Industrial and Trading Estate, the city\u2019s central commercial areas (such as Saddar) and the Landhi Industrial Area. In the mid-1980s, however, it started facing multiple problems, lack of maintenance being the most important of them. These problems had a negative impact on the quality of the services provided by the KCR and resulted in a reduction in the frequency of trains. Together, the two developments led to major financial losses which continued piling up for years, finally forcing the KCR to shut down in December 1999.\n\nA residential block near Jain Mandar in Lahore being demolished for Orange Line construction  | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nOn the other hand, political reasons foiled Karachi\u2019s initial attempts to develop a mass transit system. The Karachi Master Plan of 1975-1978 proposed the development of a light rail mass transit system along with \u201cupgrading the Circular Railway \u2026 pushing it into the suburbs through a number of spurs.\u201d The proposed system was to be \u201cpartly underground, partly elevated and partly at grade metro.\u201d All these plans, however, came to naught in 1977 after the removal of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto\u2019s government in a military coup, according to Karachi: The Transport Crisis. In 1990, the World Bank devised the Karachi Mass Transit Programme that preferred a bus rapid system over a rail-based mass transit system. The programme never took off because the politicians in power wanted a rail not a bus. No donors or contractors, however, showed any interest in what the politicians asked for. The third attempt to create a mass transit system was made in 2005 \u2013 with JICA\u2019s technical and financial support. It envisaged six BRTs linked to the KCR \u2013 essentially what is being implemented now after remaining on paper for more than a decade. One good thing to come out of it is a detailed study, published in 2012, which now serves as a master plan for all current and future public transport projects in Karachi. \n\nAn overhead bridge being constructed for the Orange Line project in Lahore | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nA family physician in Lahore, Dr Arif Hasan, opened his private clinic  opposite the historic Shalimar Gardens, in January 1981. Hasan Clinic has provided healthcare to more than 200 patients a day for 35 years. Some of his patients have been visiting his clinic since they were children. On January 9 this year, the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) knocked at Hasan Clinic\u2019s door and told Dr Hasan to vacate it in seven days to make way for the Orange Line Metro Train project under construction in different parts of Lahore. He thought of moving the court to delay, if not stop, his eviction. He did not get time for that. Also read: Nostalgia prevails in Lahore's royal quartersThe very next day at around noon, a contingent of police along with an LDA director showed up at the clinic and began removing equipment. Dr Hasan claims the government officials dragged out patients even when some of them were on intravenous drips and he lost equipment worth millions of rupees. The LDA officials razed the clinic in front of his eyes, along with many other adjacent businesses. The proprietors of some of those businesses were not even present; others say they had court orders against the demolition. \nThe government has been informing people about the impending eviction\nsince October last year, says the chief engineer of the Orange Line\nproject.\nAll of them insist the LDA violated the law while demolishing their businesses. The Land Acquisition Act of 1894, they say, necessitates that the government give a seven-day written eviction notice to the owner of a property to be acquired for a public project. No such notices were given to them \u2014 this is at least what the evicted people claim.\n\nResidents pack up their homes in Lahore due to the Orange Line construction in February 2016 | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\t\t\t\nWhen Israar Saeed, the chief engineer of the Orange Line project at the LDA, is asked about the demolition without notice of Hasan Clinic and its adjacent businesses he says simply that \u201cthis is not true.\u201d The government has been informing people about the impending eviction since October last year, he says. Other officials claim most of the demolished buildings were, indeed, encroachments on public land and, therefore, needed no prior notice for their demolition. Attiq Ahmed, an architect and urban designer, runs a think tank called Office of Conservation and Community Outreach in Lahore (OCCO) and has been working on conserving Lahore\u2019s architectural heritage for some years. He has made demographic maps of many historical areas of the city along the entire route of the Metro Bus. He insists that most buildings demolished near the Shalimar Gardens, including Hasan Clinic, were not encroachments. More than a month after the demolition, rubble still adorns the road in front of the Shalimar Gardens. Elsewhere in Lahore, the construction process for the 27.1-kilometre long and mostly elevated train track \u2013 which will link Dera Gujjran on the north-east of Lahore to Ali Town at the south-western end of the city \u2013 is leaving similar problems in its wake. Work on the project started in November 2015 and has picked up pace in recent weeks to meet the end of the year deadline for completion. To maintain a faster pace, government officials in many cases are cutting corners to acquire the required land \u2014 as the case of Hasan Clinic suggests. \u201cEveryone agrees that there is a need for a mass transit system in Lahore,\u201d says Ahmed. \u201cNobody is against that. But there is a better way to go about it.\u201d\n\nPeople vacate their homes near Jain Mandir in Lahore | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nThe Orange Line will pass by such historic sites as Chauburji, Anarkali, Jain Mandir, the General Post Office, the Supreme Court of Pakistan\u2019s Lahore registry, the Lahore High Court, Lakshmi Chowk and Lahore Railway Station. The track will have a 1.7-kilometre long \u2018semi-underground\u2019 section \u2013 crossing the gardens of the 155-year-old St Andrews Presbyterian Church, The Mall, the Lahore High Court and the Supreme Court registry \u2013 using what architects call \u2018cut and cover\u2019 technology. Despite being underground, this section \u201cwill destroy everything on the surface in its path\u201d according to documents OCCO has shared with the Herald.  \nNo new construction can happen within 200 feet of a site listed as\nprotected under these laws and there are 25 such sites located on the\ntrain\u2019s route.\nSome parts of the track also violate the National Antiquities Act 1975 and/or the Punjab Special Premises (Preservation) Ordinance 1985, the documents point out. No new construction can happen within 200 feet of a site listed as protected under these laws and there are 25 such sites located on the train\u2019s route, the documents add. In the case of the Shalimar Gardens, the World Heritage Convention 1972 mandates that the train line should be at least 250 feet away from the site \u2014 a provision not being followed. (Construction work around the protected sites has been halted by the Punjab High Court which is hearing multiple cases against the Orange Line project. According to OCCO, a heritage committee has now been formed to assess the impact of the construction on both Mughal and Colonial era monuments; a detailed report will then be presented.)   The way the government is handling these projects is not the only thing baffling architects, urban planners and community members across Lahore. They are also worried about an official disregard for technical advice: JICA's report had originally proposed that seven kilometres of the train track \u2013 from Chauburji to GT Road \u2013 should be underground. The government says going underground would have increased the cost of the project by 0.15 billion dollars \u2014 from 1.6 billion dollars to 1.75 billion dollars. \n\nImambargah torn down in Lahore | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nThose living in the buildings around Jain Mandir are packing up and leaving after having received compensation money for their properties, taken over by the government for construction of the train track. Kapurthala House and Bengali Building, both British-era structures, are being demolished. Many other newer structures around them, including shops, have already been razed. Many of those who have either already left the area, or are in the process of leaving, complain that they never received written notices as per the law for evacuating their properties. They say they were informed verbally. Others complain that the LDA officers visited them in person, in some cases even intimidating and threatening them. Saeed dismisses these allegations as baseless. \u201cWe published ads in newspapers so that people would be aware of the process,\u201d he says. \u201cWhenever there is a large-scale development project, people will protest and some will be affected.\u201d Also read: Why care about public art?That still does not alleviate the pain many are feeling at having to leave the places they had called home for decades.

Saeed compares these complaints to what happened during the construction of the Metro Bus. There was a loud uproar about its impact on the city\u2019s landscape and environment, he says, \u201cbut now everyone is happy.\u201d This might be true, at least for the 380,000 or so people who travel every day by the Metro Bus which has been operational since early 2013. Its 27-kilometre track is uncluttered, the ticketing system is efficient and the neat and tidy buses run every two minutes (to keep things this way, though, the Punjab government massively subsidises the bus service, pumping four million rupees into it every day). \n\u201cWhat do you do when your identity and entire history is taken away\nfrom you?\u201d Says Nargis Zaidi, the imambargah\u2019s caretaker.\nMehvish Khadim, 21, travels daily from her home in Shahdara, in the north of Lahore, to work at a salon in Gulberg.

The Metro Bus has allowed many women from working-class areas to get jobs in posh neighbourhoods like Gulberg, she says. In his Upper Mall office, architect Kamil Khan Mumtaz maintains his composure while listening about all the real and supposed benefits of the Metro Bus and the Orange Line train being built. When he finally speaks, every word comes out of his mouth as an epigram. \u201cThe history, the heritage, the identity, the character of Lahore is gone,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is the character of this city and its needs for urban transit?\u201d he asks and answers: \u201cThere is more than one mode of public transport and different modes are appropriate for different situations.\u201d\n\nGreen Line Metro bus passing through the Jain Mandir area in Lahore | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nMumtaz says JICA\u2019s master plan has tried to address these concerns. \u201cThis is a city where most of the population resides within a tight central area. [Whatever] most people in Lahore need is located within five kilometres from where they live. In such a situation, you don\u2019t build metro trains. This is crazy,\u201d he says, citing the JICA report. \u201cAnd you particularly don\u2019t build trains that move at four stories high.\u201d Mumtaz believes it makes more sense to clean up the traffic on the roads, to enforce traffic laws, to limit the number of motorcycles and autorickshaws and bring more buses on the roads so that everyone has access to public transport. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to construct anything; you don\u2019t need to demolish anything.\u201d Back in Old Anarkali, an elderly woman preparing to leave her home breaks down more than once. \u201cWe were refugees when we came here in 1947.

He does not venture out of Benazir Colony unless circumstances force him to. When he is told about a mass transit public transport system being planned in Karachi that will connect Orangi to the rest of the city, those around him hope the project will bring energy and prosperity back to their otherwise isolated, rundown neighbourhood. The plan, unlike the ones in Lahore, envisages little demolition but it requires massive investment in creating the required physical infrastructure such as roads, flyovers and underpasses. There is neither time nor money for that, says architect Hasan. The cost of the six BRTs, including their rolling stock, comes to be about 160 billion rupees. \u201cWhere will this money come from?\u201d Hasan asks. \u201cMy fear is that the progress on the project will be very slow.\u201d \nPublic transport buses in Karachi have declined between 2011 and 2014\n\u2014 from 22,313 to 12,399\nEven with all the required money being somehow available, the plans will take a lot of time to materialise. \u201cDelhi took about a decade to build a mass transit system; Bangkok took about 16 years,\u201d he says. \u201cKarachi may build two BRTs in the next decade and a half. Those will benefit about three per cent of the city\u2019s population. What will happen to the rest of the city?\u201d he wonders. The problems surrounding the KCR, the central hub of the mass transit plans, are even more entrenched. Most importantly, it requires relocating 5,000 families and paying them a compensation that satisfies their relocation needs. Massive encroachment of the train track is another major problem. According to the Karachi Urban Transport Corporation, which is the entity responsible for the KCR revival, 20 per cent of the KCR track has been encroached upon by squatters and illegal occupants who will also require relocation. \n\nA construction site for Green Line in Karachi | Tahir Jamal, White Star\n\n\nGiven the populist political culture of Karachi, Hasan says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is feasible to move all these people.\u201d He remains pessimistic about the KCR\u2019s revival. According to Hasan, Karachi immediately needs some transport system that is cheap and practical and that can be upgraded incrementally overtime. He suggests increasing the number of buses operating in the city and creating separate lanes for them. \u201cThe government can provide loans to bus operators to purchase more buses.\u201d He also wants the government to establish a training school for drivers and conductors to improve their skills and make them better aware of the need for following traffic laws. \u201cThis will bring great relief within two years,\u201d Hasan says. In a city where the mass transit department is a small part of the city\u2019s administration, building BRTs and reviving local railways is not just a matter of building elevated roads and removing encroachments. It will require coordination among many public and private entities; and a joint effort by many parts of the city administration, not just the transport-related entities which, so far, have been trying to plan and implement all the various projects single-handedly. \u201cThis is a question of city planning. Not just of transport planning,\u201d says Hasan. Khatri agrees. It is very difficult for a few of us to manage all the tasks, he says and adds that the Sindh Mass Transit Authority is being planned along the lines of the Punjab Metro Bus Authority. It, however, seems to be taking ages to materialise. Syed Mohammad Taha, the engineer in charge of the Karachi BRT corridors, is watching utility relocation work at the Jinnah University for Women on a crisp spring afternoon last month. When asked if this is the best way to have a public transport system in Karachi, he admits it is not. \u201cBut it is certainly a step forward,\u201d he says. \nThis was originally published in Herald's March 2016 issue.

Federal Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordina\u00adtion Mian Riaz Hussain Pirzada told reporters at the National Press Club in Islamabad on Thursday that Shahbaz Sharif should lead the party \u2014 apparently since Nawaz Sharif was facing trial in corruption cases. Editorial: Nawaz or Shahbaz?Differences between the two brothers and their heirs apparent \u2014 Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shahbaz \u2014 became public knowledge when Hamza chose to air his concerns before media after he and his father failed to dissuade the elder Sharif and his daughter from adopting a policy of confrontation with institutions, particularly after the Supreme Court announced its verdict in the Panama Papers case ousting Nawaz Sharif from office. Now it appears that Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has been cementing his position for an impending behind-the-scenes battle aimed at taking up the reins of the party, as he met long-time friend former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Friday to discuss party affairs with him. And one of the Punjab cabinet members, Raja Ashfaq Sarwar, conceded that the party lacked a clear direction and most of its members \u201care confused\u201d. The meeting between Chaudhry Nisar and Shahbaz Sharif was being seen as of great importance since both have been on the same page since the Panama Papers controversy emerged. \u201cBoth want Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz to avoid a clash with the army and the judiciary and face accountability without much complaint,\u201d a PML-N leader said. A close aide to Nawaz Sharif said that even if the court had restrained the former premier from holding the office of the party president the post might not have been given to Shahbaz Sharif on a platter. \u201cDo not rule out Maryam Nawaz\u2019s chances to don the cap of the party president in such a scenario,\u201d he said, adding that Shahbaz Sharif\u2019s role would remain confined to Punjab even after the next general elections. In a related development on Friday, Railways Minister Saad Rafique telephoned Mr Pirzada and asked him about his proposal to replace Nawaz Sharif with his brother. \u201cI told him [Saad Rafique] that what I had said is in the best interest of the party,\u201d Mr Pirzada said. There were, however, some PML-N politicians who remained unconvinced.Minister of State for Interior Affairs Talal Chaudhry said there could be a difference of opinion in the party but \u201cthere is one leader in the PML-N and he is Nawaz Sharif\u201d. Had anyone asked Shahbaz Sharif if he was interested in becoming the president of the party, he raised the question. \u201cSimilar ideas were floated during the Musharraf regime,\u201d Mr Chaudhry said, adding that after Nawaz Sharif, his brother was the most senior leader in the party and he was always there to rescue the party when such a time came. \u2018Lost\u2019 lawmakers meet\nThe situation has left the party\u2019s parliamentarians worried. They want Nawaz Sharif to give them a \u2018clear road map\u2019 going into 2018 elections and tell them who will lead them in the election campaign. They are having meetings in groups to share their growing concern about the future of the party and its direction. In background interviews, some PML-N legislators said it was the time both brothers (Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif) sat with the party men and told them how they would go into 2018 \u2014 with confrontation mode with the judiciary and the army or the party\u2019s development agenda. Besides, who will lead the party in the election campaign when Nawaz Sharif and his children are facing the graft cases. A few of the PML-N lawmakers endorsed Riaz Pirzada\u2019s criticism of the election of the party head and termed his proposal to replace Nawaz Sharif with his brother a \u2018workable solution\u2019. \u201cAt the moment most of us (parliamentarians) are confused and want Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif to have a sitting with us to give us a clear direction leading to next year\u2019s election,\u201d Punjab Minister for Labour and Human Resource Raja Ashfaq Sarwar told Dawn. Mr Sarwar has recently attended a meeting of a group of over two-dozen MPAs, mostly from south Punjab, in Lahore in which the proposal of either forming a forward bloc to negotiate better terms with the Sharifs ahead of election or backing Shahbaz Sharif as party president was reportedly discussed. Answering a question, Mr Sarwar laughed off at the idea of forward bloc in the PML-N, particularly in Punjab, and clarified that he and some 20 MPAs were invited by MPA Shaukat Lalika at his residence, where they discussed growing unrest in the party because of having no \u2018future\u2019 direction. \u201cSimilarly whenever the party legislators meet these days they discuss the same things,\u201d Mr Sarwar said and added that Nawaz Sharif on his return next week would be requested to give them time and decide the future action plan. \u201cSo far the idea of replacing Mian sahib with Shahbaz Sharif is a non-issue in the party. Nawaz Sharif is important for us and he has vote bank. But the party men want to know how to move forward,\u201d he said. Mr Lalika told Dawn that he had hosted dinner for his uncle, Ashfaq Sarwar, who recently performed Haj. \u201cI also invited about three dozen other party MPAs to the feast. We discussed the party matters and the coming election.\u201d He said the party was united under the Sharif brothers. \u201cWe never demanded or discussed replacement of Mian sahib with Shahbaz Sharif,\u201d he said. Punjab government spokesman Malik Ahmad Khan said: \u201cThere has been consensus in the PML-N that Mian sahib should remain the party president as it is united under his leadership. The whole politics of the party revolves around him. However, it is the advice of the pragmatists to the party president to restrain the hawks to neutralise the \u201cPML-N G.T. Road political discourse and NA-120 by-poll campaign\u2019s strategy of confrontation. There should be no confrontation with institutions\u201d. About the concerns of the party legislators, Mr Ahmad said: \u201cOur party men want elections. Confrontational path may delay elections, they fear. And at the same time if they are not told about who will be candidate for the office of prime minister after the 2018 election, at least they should be told who will lead the election campaign,\u201d he said. Sheikh Rasheed foresees end of \u2018Sharif politics\u2019\nMeanwhile, Awami Muslim League (AML) president Sheikh Rashid Ahmed has predicted that the PML-N is a divided house and its parliamentarians will leave the \u201cPakistan Muslim League led by Nawaz Sharif\u201d in the coming days. \u201cEarlier, I said 40 parliamentarians are ready to leave the party but now I am sure that more than 70 will do so, including Prime Minister [Shahid Khaqan] Abbasi, Chaudhry Nisar and Saad Rafique,\u201d the AML chief claimed at a public meeting outside his residence Lal Haveli in Rawalpindi. The gathering was held to protest against the government for \u201ctrying to bring changes in Khatm-i-Nabuwwat laws\u201d. Sheikh Rasheed said, \u201cNext three months are very crucial for Pakistani politics and before March all the corrupt and the ruling elite of PML-N will be kicked out.\u201d He said the politics of the Sharif family would come to an end the day when the Hudaibya Paper Mills case, which pertains to the \u201cmother of all crime\u201d, would open.Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2017\n", "title": "PML-N in a bind over ex-PM\u2019s fate", "author": "Aamir Yasin | Zulqernain Tahir"}, "1364227": {"date": "Updated October 17, 2017", "article": "\n\nLAMONGAN (Indonesia): Indonesian goalkeeper Choirul Huda of the Persela Lamongan walks out for the match against Semen Padang on Sunday.\u2014Reuters\n\n\nJAKARTA: Indonesian football fans are mourning the death of Choirul Huda, the long-term goalkeeper and captain of top flight side Lamongan FC, usually known as Persela, following an accidental collision with a team-mate during a weekend match at their stadium in East Java. Huda slumped to the ground after slamming into Brazilian midfielder Ramon Rodrigues de Mesquita during Sunday\u2019s game in the Go-Jek Traveloka league against Semen Padang at Surajaya Stadium. Rodrigues\u2019 knee had accidentally collided with Huda\u2019s chest in the incident, said the club\u2019s media officer Andika Hangga Pramana. Video footage showed the 38-year-old clutching his chest in pain before he was taken off the pitch on a stretcher after losing consciousness and a medical team at the stadium attempted to resuscitate him. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, but died several hours later. In a statement released by the club, doctor Yudistira Andri Nugroho, head of the emergency Care Unit at the Soegiri Hospital, Lamongan, said Huda, the team captain and a veteran of more than 500 games since his debut in 1999, sustained a traumatic injury and died of cardiac arrest. Nugroho said Huda suffered possible neck and head trauma from the impact to his chest and lower jaw after he dived at the feet of on-rushing players and was caught by the legs of Rodrigues. \u201cHuda was taken to the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and given breathing assistance and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but his condition deteriorated and he was pronounced dead at 4.45 pm,\u201d Nugroho said a statement. \u201cWe did all we could to restore the vital functions of Choirul Huda\u2019s organs,\u201d the doctor said. His fellow players had gone to straight to the hospital after the final whistle following their 2-0 win and supporters later went to his house with candles. Edy Rahmayadi, the chairman of Indonesia\u2019s football association, issued a statement Monday saying: \u201cIndonesian football grieves and loses with the death of Choirul Huda, one of Indonesia\u2019s best goalkeepers. May your soul rest in peace.\u201d It was the fourth death in the Indonesian league since 2000, most caused by collisions between players.Persela paid tribute to Huda calling him \u201cThe Real Legend\u201d of the club in a posting on Twitter. According to the team\u2019s Instagram page, the club will retire the number one jersey worn by Huda. Thousands of fans also took to social media in memory of Huda, who had been known to Persela supporters as \u201cOne Man, One Club, One Love\u201d. Huda leaves behind a wife and two children.

He ensured the World Bank \u201crectified\u201d the game of numbers that triggered a fresh storm around the fading foreign exchange reserves which had renewed calls for his resignation.And even though Mr Dar could not personally make it to the annual IMF-World Bank gathering \u2014 owing to his ongoing legal difficulties \u2014 engagement with the lending agency by his close aides delivered the desired results.In a rare show, the World Bank \u201cclarified\u201d that external financing needs of nine per cent of GDP, or $31 billion, was extrapolation on data and agreed that foreign portfolio investments were not part of Pakistan\u2019s external financing needs.\nThough it is easier said than done, in an environment of heightened political and institutional temperature the country needs to calm the critical commentary\nYet, it still insisted the country was facing headwinds in the external sector and the rising fiscal deficit could put macroeconomic management at risk.\u201cThis has resulted in increased external financing needs of 5-6pc of GDP in financial year 2018, or around $17bn, to cover rising current account deficit and debt repayments,\u201d the bank said. These projections are even lower than Pakistan\u2019s $18bn estimates for the current year\u2019s foreign exchange needs.Meanwhile, the finance ministry was, behind the scene, in negotiation with local and international banks for short-term inflows to sustain national forex reserves of about $14bn \u2014 a threshold for three months of import cover \u2014 to remain an uninterrupted recipient of the World Bank loan.During this breathing space, Pakistan has to fill the gap for a longer sustainability through a combination of relatively cheaper sukuk (Islamic bonds) backed by assets collateral and traditional international commercial bond, totalling around $2bn with five- to 10-year maturity.The process is almost ready: banks selected, markets identified and targets firmed up, but the decision on the precise timing is as yet undecided.Though it is easier said than done, in an environment of heightened political and institutional temperature \u2014 to which Mr Dar and his political leadership had a fair share of contribution \u2014 the country still needs to calm the critical commentary that is creating a perception of crisis on the economic, security and political fronts.This is important because mark-up costs from international capital markets are directly linked to the vulnerability and eagerness factor of the fund-raising client.More importantly, doing so would be a test of PML-N\u2019s political maturity and negotiation skills to manage expectations of additional domestic resource flows to voters in an election year, and the security needs that have been constrained by disruption of about Rs125bn on account of Coalition Support Fund from the United States this year.Mr Dar has sent the message across that the security cost has increased from 17pc of federal budget four years ago to 21pc even though many allocations remain wrapped in other grants and Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).In this push and pull for a greater share in a limited pie, the powerful have always been able to secure the most, but a fine balance would depend on many variables.Under a tighter control on the purse this year, the Ministry of Finance has thrown the lowest first quarter fiscal deficit in 10 years \u2014 0.9pc of GDP \u2014 despite a higher-than-usual development expenditure and lower non-tax revenue yield.This is a significant sign as the country showed the highest full-year fiscal deficit in five years just last year and private economists forecasted a deficit of 1.5pc of GDP in the first quarter this year.On its part, the government has already passed on the additional security cost of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to the public at large by making its financing a part of the consumer tariff in case of all the power projects on the one hand, and the cost of other development PSDP projects on the other.On top of that, Mr Dar has been advocating setting aside at least 3pc of net divisible pool resources for additional security expenditure.Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has taken steps to pacify the environment. He has supervised healthy briefings to key stakeholders for a \u201cbetter understanding\u201d and sent outreach teams of revenue machinery to explain why filing income tax returns by every individual is a key to expanding the tax base.At the same time, he has directed the finance minister to create space out of the divisible pool under the National Finance Commission (NFC) to proportionately bear the burden of additional security costs \u2014 a proposal Mr Dar has been advancing for almost two years now without any result, except delaying the fresh NFC arrangement.Stakeholders need to rise above the impression of pointing figures and jointly put the house in order, both in economic and security deliverables, instead of scratching wounds that would help none. Published in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, October 23rd, 2017\n", "title": "Dar\u2019s difficulties", "author": "Khaleeq Kiani"}, "1367867": {"date": "Updated November 02, 2017", "article": "\n\nThe writer is a member of staff.\n\n\nPlanning minister Mr Ahsan Iqbal has finally confirmed that the CPEC Long Term Plan (LTP) is about to be finalised on Nov 21 at the seventh Joint Cooperation Committee to be held in Islamabad. Some might recall that details from the LTP in question were published by Dawn in a long detailed report in May, and the same minister had reacted sharply at the time, saying that the details are \u201cfactually incorrect\u201d and the real plan will be made public once it has been finalised. It looks like that moment is at last arriving, if the minister lives up to his promise of releasing the full document. If they do what they did earlier in the year, and produce a shortened, sanitised and general summary of the main LTP, and release that claiming that it is the original document, we will know that an effort is being made to conceal the real details of CPEC from the public. To recap the conversations that took place around the time when the Dawn story revealed the details of the plan, there were four main areas of focus identified by the Chinese side and a few from the Pakistanis. The Chinese appeared primarily interested in agriculture, industrial zones and tourism, along with a digital strategy to expand fibre optic connectivity and build a submarine cable landing station in Gwadar to carry some of their digital traffic from the western provinces out via Pakistan rather than routing it through servers in Europe.\nCPEC is about preparing the country to receive massive amounts of Chinese investments, personnel and culture.\nIn addition, there was a detailed financial strategy, which called upon the government of Pakistan to expand the role of the yuan in its economy, turn more to raising debt from the markets in Hong Kong, and dedicate increasing resources from its own budget, as well as provincial and local bodies\u2019 budgets, towards CPEC-related priorities.Since then, we have seen something odd happening. Many of the priorities identified in the LTP have indeed been pursued since, but without any of the fanfare associated with the inauguration of roads and power plants. For example, the national food security policy announced in July contained an entire section dedicated to the creation of CPEC-related agriculture development zones as one solution to the country\u2019s future food security issues. Many of the details in that policy document sound almost identical to the priorities highlighted by the Chinese in their LTP document, produced by the China Development Bank under the auspices of the National Development Reform Commission.In other examples, a recent news item highlighted the fact that a Chinese company has entered into an MoU with the city of Karachi to build an elevated road, almost four kilometres long, from Clifton Beach to Hawkesbay. A closer read of the actual MoU shows that the road is in fact being built to carry traffic to a Chinese resort to be built in Hawkesbay beach, possibly one of the first of the many tourist resorts to be built along the coastal strip from Badin to Gwadar identified in the Dawn report.There are innumerable examples now. Land acquisition is under way in various areas around KP to build housing for Chinese personnel who will reside in the province in the years when CPEC-related investment begins pouring into the country. The basic point here is simple: we have all been led to believe that CPEC is about connectivity, roads and power plants. In reality, it is about much more than that. It is about preparing the country to receive massive amounts of Chinese investments, personnel and culture. None of this implies that CPEC is a bad thing, as some people are ready to conclude without reflection. It is only to imply that the real details of what is being negotiated under the CPEC umbrella need to be publicly known, and efforts to hide these details from the public in a democratic country like Pakistan, where transparency and debate around issues of national importance are the norm, are bound to fuel adverse commentary and conspiracy theorising.When the minister issued his sharp response to the Dawn story about the LTP, he was given a clear stage upon which to air his grievances with the story. When has asked for more time to be allowed to make the details of the LTP, he was given the time he said he required. But now that he has confirmed that the LTP is about to be finalised, it must be insisted that the time to deliver on his commitment has also arrived.It is worth bearing in mind a couple of tricks that the government could resort to in order to try and wiggle out of this commitment without appearing to do so. Early in the year, when it needed provincial government assent for the plan, it generated a shorter, edited draft of the original LTP and circulated that to the provincial governments. Later, the government tried to argue that the edited version is the real one, and the longer, detailed draft was only a \u201cworking document\u201d. A few people fell for this gimmick, thinking that somehow there are multiple drafts of the plan in play. In reality there was only one, and the shorter one was only a summary meant for public consumption with all vital details removed. Such gimmickry must not be resorted to this time. The LTP is one of the most important documents in the arena these days, far more than the LNG contract that members of the opposition parties are clamouring for access to. It is bewildering to see the same members of the opposition parties holding their silence regarding the disclosure of the LTP. How has the silence of the opposition parties been obtained? Have they seen the LTP to be satisfied that no further discussion is required? The demands for CPEC transparency are more consequential for Pakistan\u2019s long-term prospects, especially for its economy, and silence does not serve that interest well.

Almost all pollution-related deaths \u2014 around 92 per cent \u2014 took place in poor or middle-income countries, the research found. And in rapidly industrialising countries such as India, Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Madagascar, pollution is linked to as many as a quarter of all fatalities. \u201cPollution is much more than an environmental challenge; it is a profound and pervasive threat that affects many aspects of human health and wellbeing,\u201d said Philip Landrigan, a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the United States who co-led the study.  The study found pollution was linked to around nine million deaths in 2015.  Dirty air \u2014 caused by everything from transport and industry to indoor fires \u2014 was the biggest contributor linked to 6.5m deaths, it said.  The next biggest contributor was polluted water that spread gastrointestinal diseases and parasitic infections and killed 1.8m people.
