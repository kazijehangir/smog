Violence in the disputed region has witnessed a surge over the past few months.\u2014AFP\n\n\nSRINAGAR: Indian army claimed that two air force commandos and two Kashmiris were killed in what it described as a fierce gun battle in India-held Kashmir on Wednesday. According to Col Rajesh Kalia, an army spokesman, troops cordoned off the northern Hajin town after getting a tip-off that some armed Kashmiris had been spotted in the area. The deaths occurred in the ensuing gun battle, he claimed. It is the first time the Indian army has said that air force personnel were participating in ground combat against Kashmiris in the disputed region. Col Kalia said the two air force commandos \u201cwere operating with the army for operational experience and training\u201d. In 1990, at least four air force officers were killed in an ambush, but they were not participating in any operation. Street clashes erupted in Hajin shortly after the fighting ended as hundreds of residents demanded an end to Indian rule in held Kashmir. Government forces fired tear gas and shotgun pellets to quell the rock-throwing protesters. Protesters later marched in the town carrying the body of one of the dead Kashmiris. They chanted anti-India and pro-freedom slogans. Anti-India sentiment runs deep in Kashmir\u2019s population and most people either support independence or merger of their territory with Pakistan.

Ryan Dillon, came as coalition allies were working out ways to safely evacuate an estimated 4,000 civilians who remain trapped in the city.The coalition has said IS militants are holding some civilians as human shields, preventing them from escaping as the fight enters its final stages. The city, on the banks of the Euphrates River, has been badly damaged by the fighting, and activists have reported that over 1,000 civilians have been killed there since June.The United Nations estimates 8,000 people are trapped in Raqa, and said September was the worst month in 2017 for civilians in Syria.Dillon said the Raqa Civil Council, a local administration of Arab and Kurdish officials, was leading the discussions to ensure the safe evacuation of civilians. However, it was not clear with whom the council is speaking inside Raqa. A Kurdish-led force, the Syrian Democratic Forces, is leading the battle on the ground.\u201cWe are seeing some good progress of civilians that are being able to safely exit Raqa. The trend has turned into ... a broader effort by the Raqa Civil Council to get the remaining civilians out of there,\u201d Dillon told The Associated Press. He said at least 700 civilians have been evacuated from the city since Monday.But Dillon added that discussions about the fate of the militants remaining in the city have focused on \u201cunconditional surrender\u201d.A negotiated withdrawal \u201cis absolutely something that we as a coalition would not be a part of or agree with,\u201d Dillon added.Between 300 and 400 militants are believed to be holed up in about four square kilometres of Raqa, including in the city\u2019s stadium and a hospital, he said.The stadium is believed to be used by the militants as weapons warehouse and a prison while the hospital is one of their major headquarters.Dillon said that in the last three weeks, up to 15 militants, including a senior leader, have surrendered in Raqa, a trend also seen in Iraq. Dillon said another leading figure was arrested when he tried to escape among a group of civilians.Air strikes on the city appeared to have decreased recently, apparently to allow for the evacuations. The coalition reported just five air strikes near Raqa on Tuesday.The extremist group has suffered a series of major battlefield defeats in both Iraq and Syria in recent months, but has continued to stage attacks far from the front lines.At least three suicide bombers struck outside the police headquarters in central Damascus on Wednesday, killing at least two people and wounding others, according to the Syrian interior minister.IS claimed the attack through its Aamaq news agency. The extremist group carried out a similar attack on a Damascus police station last week that killed 17 people.The pro-government Al-Ikhbariya TV on Wednesday showed pictures from outside the heavily guarded police headquarters, which is encircled by blast walls.

The Socceroos face home-and-away clashes against the fourth-placed team from the CONCACAF federation for a spot at next year\u2019s World Cup finals in Russia. The opening tie is in Honduras on November 10 with the return leg in Sydney five days later. Aston Villa star Jedinak missed the Socceroos\u2019 final qualifiers with a groin problem, which also kept him out of their Asian play-off with Syria. But the experienced midfielder was included in a 30-man squad by coach Ange Postecoglou, whose future is up in the air amid reports he will quit regardless of whether they make the World Cup or not. Postecoglou has retained 22 of the 23 players involved against Syria, with only the injured Brad Smith missing. Striker Mathew Leckie and midfielder Marl Milligan were included although they both miss the first leg through suspension. The final 23 will be finalised next week, and Postecoglou said he was confident whoever was picked would help propel Australia to its fourth-consecutive World Cup appearance. \u201cThere are a couple of weeks before the group gets together so we will be monitoring the health and fitness of every player to make sure that the final 23 are available for what is going to be a challenging couple of games,\u201d he said. \u201cWe feel that we are right on schedule with regards to our arrangements, logistics and intelligence for Honduras, and are comfortable that the work completed and decisions made so far will help us in our quest to qualify for Russia.\u201d He added that having the second leg at home would be a boost for the team. \u201cA large, vocal home crowd in Sydney for the second leg is something that everyone involved with the squad is looking forward to,\u201d said Postecoglou.

It did not cite the prime minister himself but a \u201csource\u201d close to him.Predominantly Shia Iran and its Sunni rival Saudi Arabia are locked in a proxy war for influence in the Middle East.The international battle against the militant Islamic State group in northern Iraq since 2014 saw the United States and Iran effectively fighting on the same side, with both supporting the Iraqi government against the militants.Washington has 5,000 troops in Iraq, and provided air support, training and weapons to Iraqi government forces, even as Iran armed, trained and advised the Shia paramilitaries which often fought alongside the army.But the latest twist in the Iraq conflict, pitting the central government against the Kurds, is trickier for US policymakers. Washington still supports the central government but has also been allied to the Kurds for decades.Iran exhibited its sway over Baghdad\u2019s policies during tensions over a referendum last month in which the semi-autonomous Kurdistan region voted to secede from Iraq against Baghdad\u2019s wishes, Kurdish officials say.Baghdad responded to the vote by seizing the oil city of Kirkuk, which the Kurds see as the heart of any future homeland.Major-General Qassem Soleimani, commander of foreign operations for Iran\u2019s elite Revolutionary Guards, repeatedly warned Kurdish leaders to withdraw from Kirkuk or face an onslaught by Iraqi forces and allied Iranian-backed fighters, Kurdish officials briefed on the meetings said.Iraq\u2019s Sunni neighbours, including Saudi Arabia, share Washington\u2019s concerns over Shia power Iran\u2019s influence in Iraq, where the population is predominantly Shia.The office of Abadi, himself a Shia, said the paramilitary forces were under the authority of the Iraqi government. \u201cPopular Mobilisation are Iraqi patriots,\u201d it said in the statement.Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif also rejected Tillerson\u2019s statement.

The absence of such a strategy is acutely felt even as we celebrate this important success\u201d in Raqa, he added.Syria\u2019s conflict began in March 2011 with anti-government protests, but quickly spiralled into a bitter and complex civil war, with IS just one element in a shifting matrix of players.About 900 US ground troops, the bulk of them special operations forces, are in northern Syria, where they have provided critical support to a Kurdish and Arab coalition called the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).The alliance has benefited from weaponry and technical know-how, with US commandos training the locals on how to call in air strikes.They get constant support from US-led coalition planes and drones, and the Pentagon sent a Marine artillery to help near Raqa, while US forces also expanded a runway for military cargo planes at a northern Syria air base.Cleaning up the mess\nMilitarily, the anti-IS fight in Syria is not quite over, with the militants still entrenched in towns and villages along the Euphrates River Valley.The IS militants have lost nearly all the territory they once controlled in Iraq and Syria, but are also establishing footholds in other countries such as Yemen and Afghanistan.Towns abandoned by IS are littered with explosives, mines and booby traps.We\u2019ll \u201csupport the stabilisation efforts in Raqa, and other liberated areas, to include the removal of explosives left behind by ISIS, restoring basic services, and supporting local governing bodies,\u201d State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.President Donald Trump, who has spoken little about Syria or hinted at any sort of broader long-term strategy, faces a situation far different from when Barack Obama commenced military operations in Syria.Russia joined the conflict in late 2015, quickly tipping it in favour of President Bashar al-Assad, while the influence of Iran and Tehran-backed militias also grew rapidly.For John Hannah, senior counsellor for the Foundation for Defence of Democracies and former national security advisor to vice president Dick Cheney, Raqa\u2019s recapture is not likely to mark the end of US involvement in Syria.He said Trump\u2019s tough line on Iran \u2014 the president last week refused to certify the Iran nuclear deal \u2014 must translate to action to stem Tehran\u2019s influence in Syria.\u201cIf President Trump\u2019s strategy for countering Iran is to have any meaning at all, it must almost certainly include a robust effort to contain and constrict the IRGC\u2019s commanding role in Syria,\u201d Hannah told AFP, using the abbreviation for the Iran\u2019s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.Published in Dawn, October 19th, 2017\n", "title": "After Raqa, US mly advised to keep regional realities in mind", "author": "AFP"}, "1367555": {"date": "November 01, 2017", "article": "KARACHI: Sindh Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah has said that after the restoration of law and order in the city his government has embarked on a \u2018Safe City\u2019 project to keep an eye on the movement of people and vehicular traffic.

It was the Chinese Minister of Environmental Protection, Li Ganjie, stating at a news conference that a strengthened environmental protection system would eventually benefit the country\u2019s economic development. He was responding to public expectations to improve air quality. He also told reporters \u201cWe are fully aware of the problems we are facing. Coal accounts for a high proportion of the overall energy mix.\u201d Also, \u201cwe have too many commodities transported by trucks. Some companies avoid emission-control measures. Some local governments are not enforcing measures from the central government.\u201d He said that China will strive to comply fully with its own air quality standards by 2035.Resolve, perseverance, and determination are words that I would use to describe the Chinese response to tackling air pollution. It was not always this way. The Chinese (and the world) had a very bad understanding of the effect of air pollution on health, as recently as 20 years ago. \nChina is a great example of a country acting in a focused way to reduce air pollution.\nInitially, acid rain (from poor air quality) affected crops and damaged buildings in the 1980s in China, becoming much more prevalent by the 1990s. This rang the alarm bells for the Chinese government to take air quality seriously. The impact of air quality on human health was only just being understood better at the time. Some remarkable efforts followed, including the Chinese putting in place strict sulphur-emissions regulations for their coal power plants, realising that this was an important cause of their pollution. Due to domestic demand, this created a huge market for flue gas desulphurization technology, which the Chinese took on, significantly reducing the global price for this technology. Indeed, according to an industry report, by 2009, China was operating 379,000 MW of scrubbers compared to only 130,000 MW in the US. China is also the largest supplier of many types of air pollution-control equipment and several Chinese companies are the world\u2019s leading suppliers of electrostatic precipitators.  The air quality problem has continued to get worse resulting in the Chinese putting in place even stricter standards for coal plant technology (such as super critical plants) and also investing in other renewable technologies. They also continue to cancel planned and under-construction coal power plants. For example, in January 2017, China cancelled 103 planned and under-construction coal power plants, amounting to 120 GW capacity (yes, gigawatts, ie 120,000 MW). Air quality management is a continuous battle in China, given the extent of locked-in coal-based power generation, keeping China on its toes \u2014 even more so these days as the world, and China\u2019s own citizens, better understand the effect of poor air quality on their health. To their great credit, the Chinese keep this issue front and centre on many fronts, including their active championing of the Paris Climate Agreement, shifting away from a position of highlighting their low carbon emissions per capita and the \u2018right\u2019 of all Chinese people to own a (petrol-powered) car. And it is not about their citizens losing out either, but rather about doing things differently.Indeed, China is shifting deliberately towards an electric car future for its citizens. In doing so, China puts itself clearly in a high moral position, advocating for a better quality of life for its own citizens, as well as a global champion. At the same time, Chinese industry continues to actively help bring down the cost of both air pollution-control technologies and certain renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaic cells, making it a market leader. China is a great example of a country acting in a focused way to reduce air pollution, prompted by economic and health concerns, but it also shows how difficult it is to clean up if it is left too late. Today, with CPEC, Pakistan is poised for greater economic growth. Can\u2019t we also ask China for help on air quality, under the CPEC umbrella, so we can learn from them and avoid the problems that they face today? We might even be able to partner with Chinese industries to produce the pollution-control technologies we need to help control our own air quality.A few obvious areas on which to request help from China include the setting up of an air quality-monitoring system for our major cities, so we can actually monitor the pollution. We also need to strengthen the courses in our universities on air pollution, perhaps by partnering with the Chinese, so we can build Pakistani capacity to understand the problem, analyse the sources of pollution and develop the policies and measures to address it. Capacity building at the state and the national level of our government officials is important, so they can better develop and enforce appropriate environmental standards, which are the main policy tool for protecting human health, if applied properly. China consciously put in place training programmes, for not just its environment professionals, but for all municipal officials, on topics such as Strategic Environmental Assessment, to raise awareness of environmental issues. I know this, because I was one of the course lecturers, and the Chinese translated one of my books for teaching purposes. Learning about the different roles of the national government and the local governments in improving air quality would also be useful, given that in Pakistan, the 18th Amendment devolves the responsibility for environmental management to the provincial level, and rightly so, as they are closest to the ground. Just these four bits of primarily intellectual help from China could yield us a lot, such as a future in which we (and our children) could be breathing clean air.The World Health Organisation estimated that the mortality rate in Pakistan attributable to household and ambient pollution per 100,000 population was 87.2 in 2012. With a population of 177.9 million in 2012, that means that 155,000 deaths that year in Pakistan were attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution alone. Compare this number with the 62,574 people who died in Pakistan from terrorist violence between 2003 and Oct 22, 2017, with the worst year on record as 2009, with 11,704 fatalities, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal. When will we feel the pressure that it is time to act on air quality to protect the health (and life) of Pakistani citizens? It\u2019s time to leverage our special relationship with China to ask for help, in conjunction with CPEC, on a topic on which they are truly world experts. It would be foolish to let this opportunity pass us by.

According to many reports, the smog is coming from the burning of agricultural waste in Indian Punjab, and satellite imagery actually shows the widespread prevalence of the farm fires. There is little to nothing that the provincial authorities here can do to reduce the intensity of the smog, although much can be done to mitigate its impact, such as issuing alerts and raising awareness about steps that citizens can take to protect themselves from its harmful effects. In addition, the capacity of public-sector hospitals to deal with smog-related respiratory ailments can also be increased.But when it comes to actually dealing with the causes, Pakistan needs a channel of communication open with the Indian government, preferably at the provincial level, to raise the matter formally. It is not clear whether the practice of burning agricultural waste is new and why smog of this kind has not been seen in the longer-term past. Last year it was there, but the usual smog that has engulfed Punjab\u2019s cities comes later in the year, and has been linked by a couple of studies to chemical pollutants produced from coal-fired power plants across the border. Problems such as pollution, climate change and water flows know no boundaries, and both countries are facing a rising arc of challenges from these with each passing year. Whatever may be the sentiments on either side, at some point both India and Pakistan will have to talk to each other about these issues, or they will suffer the consequences together. Given the huge impact that these challenges have on the lives of the masses on both sides of the border, a pragmatic approach is becoming increasingly urgent. Clarity of mind is needed on both sides before the smog in the air, and in their relationship, can be cleared in a more permanent way.Published in Dawn, November 3rd, 2017\n", "title": "Smoggy relations", "author": "Editorial"}, "1367793": {"date": "November 02, 2017", "article": "LAHORE: Plummeting temperature and a spike in pollutants \u2013 mainly ash and smoke from crop stubble burning in adjacent Indian Punjab fields \u2013 worsened the smog in Lahore and several other cities in the Punjab on Wednesday.     A cloud of thick smog blanketed Lahore early in the morning and thickened in the evening, creating a health hazard especially for children, the elderly and those riding bicycles and motorcycles.Scrambling to clamp down on local sources of pollutants, the Environment Protection Department revealed that crop stubble was being burnt even in areas around Lahore city.The Space and Upper Atmosphere Research Commission (Suparco) has reportedly detected around 1,000 fires in areas close to Lahore, an official said. Other officials revealed that they had received reports about crop stubble being set alight in fields near Hafizabad, Okara, Sheikhupura, Pakpattan and Gujranwala.In view of the seriousness of the issue, the Home Department had banned stubble burning under Section 144, and an EPD official shared that they had registered 114 cases in this regard and arrested 41 farmers by Wednesday evening.    Sources said that Suparco\u2019s latest satellite images had showed 34,535 crop stubble burning incidents in Indian Punjab and 4,702 fires in Pakistan\u2019s side of the Punjab by October 31. Meteorologists explained that pollutants carried on soft wind from India were suspended in the air because of increased moisture in the atmosphere, caused by a decrease in the overall temperature.Local sources of pollution, including emissions from steel mills and brick kilns, vehicular emissions, and dust due to the unrelenting construction of roads and tracks for the metro train were worsening the situation. They said that the smog would either be washed away by the rain or pushed out of the city by strong wind. At present, there is neither.EPD officials said the department was working in close liaison with other government departments and agencies to control local sources of pollution. The department had sealed 170 steel mills all over the Punjab by Wednesday, including 130 mills in Lahore city which has at least 350 steel re-rolling mills along its north-eastern side alone.The officials said that dust was rising from the site of the metro train between Chauburji and Ali Razabad, Lahore canal\u2019s Dharampura and Mughalpura stretch where an underpass is being constructed, and the roads being dug to lay cables for the Safe City Project.Contractors of the development projects have been told to sprinkle water on the earth and to cover the mounds of dirt with plastic sheets. The Safe City Project authorities, too, have been asked to get the dug up roads repaired without delay. The brick kilns association has been told to ensure that its members stop using fossil fuels and other fuels contributing to pollution by Nov 15, or face action.The police have been told to support the EPD in sealing the steel mills owned by influential people, many of whom burn tyres for cheap fuel.Separately in Multan, five flights were cancelled as a thick fog blanketed Multan International Airport on Wednesday.  According to officials of the Civil Aviation Authority, three international flights \u2013 Bahrain-Multan-Bahrain of Gulf Air, Jeddah-Multan-Jeddah of Saudi Airline and Dubai-Multan-Dubai of Emirates Airline \u2013 were cancelled due to smog, while domestic flights of the PIA, including the Islamabad-Multan-Lahore and the Multan-Islamabad flights were cancelled.Published in Dawn, November 2nd, 2017\n", "title": "EPD takes action against polluters as thick smog blankets Punjab", "author": "Intikhab Hanif"}, "1281222": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "KARACHI: Audience at a conference on sustainable cities were informed on Wednesday that Pakistan suffered Rs365 billion annual losses because of constant environmental degradation. \u201cThe public health sector accounts for having biggest share in such a colossal loss of Rs1 billion every day to the government exchequer,\u201d said Naeem Ahmed Mughal, director-general of the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency while speaking at the conference titled \u201cMaking our cities sustainable\u201d organised by the National Forum for Environment and Health (NFEH) in connection with its 13th Annual Environmental Excellence Awards at a hotel. He informed the audience that in future the local government agencies would be put to prosecution as a matter of policy without giving them any exemption as like cases against other public, private, and industrial institutions in the province were referred to environmental tribunals for their unsafe practices causing damage to environment. Sindh Transport Minister Nasir Hussain Shah said the present Sindh government of the Pakistan Peoples Party was fully committed to resolving transportation problems of the people of Karachi for which Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) was being constructed. He said in a coming few days, he would fly to China for signing a memorandum of understanding for launching the Yellow Line \u2014 a component of BRTS. He claimed that the Sindh government on its part had completed all the prerequisites and formalities regarding the revival of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) and now it was up to the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to make progress for building the circular railway service in Karachi. He said PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed the provincial authorities to give another chance to JICA to make progress towards revival of the KCR, otherwise the Sindh government should go for a renowned Chinese firm to build the project. He said the Sindh government was fully committed to the cause of environment mitigation as for this reason the scope of provincial environment department had been expanded to include subject of climate change and also that the chief minister was holding the additional portfolio of environment department. He said that owing to unchecked practices of municipal agencies, 450 million gallons of untreated waste water was being released into the Arabian Sea while air pollution had been rapidly increasing owing to absence of any solid and municipal waste management system while district municipal corporations were engaged in burning of domestic waste instead of its safe disposal. Ijaz Ahmed Khilji, an expert of mass transport systems, said 42 per cent population of Karachi was dependent on public transport system while passenger buses and other public carriers accounted for just 4.5pc of total number of vehicles, thus, creating serious stress on existing passenger vehicles plying on roads of Karachi. Secretary for environment and climate change Aijaz Talpur said Sindh had been actively pleading its case that 220 megawatts generated by it through alternative source of energy at the Jhimpir wind corridor should be used on a preferential basis through transmission lines giving connectivity to national power grid instead of waiting for completion of the solar power project in southern Punjab.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "title": "\u2018Environment degradation causes Rs365bn  annual losses\u2019", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter"}, "1367811": {"date": "November 02, 2017", "article": "NEW YORK: A Mexican actor became the latest to accuse Kevin Spacey of sexual harassment on Tuesday, predicting more such claims would emerge as Netflix suspended production of the two-time Oscar winner\u2019s hit series \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d.Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at London\u2019s Old Vic theater when Spacey was artistic director there from 2004 to 2015, said the Hollywood star routinely preyed on young male actors.\u201cIt seems the only requirement was to be a male under the age of 30 for Mr Spacey to feel free to touch us,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post.The accusation echoed the claim made Sunday by American actor Anthony Rapp, who said Spacey made a \u201csexual advance\u201d on him at a party in 1986, when he was 14 and Spacey was 26.Responding to the allegation \u2014 and the outraged backlash in its wake \u2014 streaming giant Netflix announced it has suspended production of the sixth season of \u201cHouse of Cards,\u201d the award-winning political drama starring Spacey.The suspension was \u201cuntil further notice, to give us time to review the current situation and to address any concerns of our cast and crew,\u201d said Netflix and producer Media Rights Capital.Season six, which Netflix had already confirmed on Monday would be the final edition of its flagship production, had been scheduled to air in 2018.

He ensured the World Bank \u201crectified\u201d the game of numbers that triggered a fresh storm around the fading foreign exchange reserves which had renewed calls for his resignation.And even though Mr Dar could not personally make it to the annual IMF-World Bank gathering \u2014 owing to his ongoing legal difficulties \u2014 engagement with the lending agency by his close aides delivered the desired results.In a rare show, the World Bank \u201cclarified\u201d that external financing needs of nine per cent of GDP, or $31 billion, was extrapolation on data and agreed that foreign portfolio investments were not part of Pakistan\u2019s external financing needs.\nThough it is easier said than done, in an environment of heightened political and institutional temperature the country needs to calm the critical commentary\nYet, it still insisted the country was facing headwinds in the external sector and the rising fiscal deficit could put macroeconomic management at risk.\u201cThis has resulted in increased external financing needs of 5-6pc of GDP in financial year 2018, or around $17bn, to cover rising current account deficit and debt repayments,\u201d the bank said. These projections are even lower than Pakistan\u2019s $18bn estimates for the current year\u2019s foreign exchange needs.Meanwhile, the finance ministry was, behind the scene, in negotiation with local and international banks for short-term inflows to sustain national forex reserves of about $14bn \u2014 a threshold for three months of import cover \u2014 to remain an uninterrupted recipient of the World Bank loan.During this breathing space, Pakistan has to fill the gap for a longer sustainability through a combination of relatively cheaper sukuk (Islamic bonds) backed by assets collateral and traditional international commercial bond, totalling around $2bn with five- to 10-year maturity.The process is almost ready: banks selected, markets identified and targets firmed up, but the decision on the precise timing is as yet undecided.Though it is easier said than done, in an environment of heightened political and institutional temperature \u2014 to which Mr Dar and his political leadership had a fair share of contribution \u2014 the country still needs to calm the critical commentary that is creating a perception of crisis on the economic, security and political fronts.This is important because mark-up costs from international capital markets are directly linked to the vulnerability and eagerness factor of the fund-raising client.More importantly, doing so would be a test of PML-N\u2019s political maturity and negotiation skills to manage expectations of additional domestic resource flows to voters in an election year, and the security needs that have been constrained by disruption of about Rs125bn on account of Coalition Support Fund from the United States this year.Mr Dar has sent the message across that the security cost has increased from 17pc of federal budget four years ago to 21pc even though many allocations remain wrapped in other grants and Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).In this push and pull for a greater share in a limited pie, the powerful have always been able to secure the most, but a fine balance would depend on many variables.Under a tighter control on the purse this year, the Ministry of Finance has thrown the lowest first quarter fiscal deficit in 10 years \u2014 0.9pc of GDP \u2014 despite a higher-than-usual development expenditure and lower non-tax revenue yield.This is a significant sign as the country showed the highest full-year fiscal deficit in five years just last year and private economists forecasted a deficit of 1.5pc of GDP in the first quarter this year.On its part, the government has already passed on the additional security cost of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to the public at large by making its financing a part of the consumer tariff in case of all the power projects on the one hand, and the cost of other development PSDP projects on the other.On top of that, Mr Dar has been advocating setting aside at least 3pc of net divisible pool resources for additional security expenditure.Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has taken steps to pacify the environment. He has supervised healthy briefings to key stakeholders for a \u201cbetter understanding\u201d and sent outreach teams of revenue machinery to explain why filing income tax returns by every individual is a key to expanding the tax base.At the same time, he has directed the finance minister to create space out of the divisible pool under the National Finance Commission (NFC) to proportionately bear the burden of additional security costs \u2014 a proposal Mr Dar has been advancing for almost two years now without any result, except delaying the fresh NFC arrangement.Stakeholders need to rise above the impression of pointing figures and jointly put the house in order, both in economic and security deliverables, instead of scratching wounds that would help none.

On the brink of being eliminated from World Cup qualifying for the first time in almost five decades, Messi scored all three goals in Argentina\u2019s 3-1 comeback victory on Tuesday at Ecuador overcoming the thin air in the Andes. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been crazy if Argentina didn\u2019t play the World Cup,\u201d Messi said. \u201cThis is what we came for. And on top of that we started behind. Luckily, we reacted quickly after Ecuador scored. Thank God, we fulfilled our objective.\u201d Messi said the Argentina squad \u201cwill change, will grow a lot, will be stronger after this\u201d. But there\u2019s still work to do for Argentina, the two-time champions who lost the final three years ago to Germany 1-0. Messi has yet to hoist a major trophy for his country of birth, a contrast to the laurels he\u2019s brought Barcelona. He\u2019ll turn 31 during the World Cup in Russia, so this may be his last chance. \u201cMessi does not owe Argentina a World Cup, but rather football owes him a World Cup,\u201d Argentine coach Jorge Sampaoli said. \u201cHe\u2019s the best player in history. This is a team victory. They played a brilliant match.\u201d Uruguay and Colombia also qualified after a dramatic last round of South American fixtures that also saw Peru clinch a playoff spot and Chile miss out completely. The top four teams in South America get automatic spots at next year\u2019s tournament in Russia. Brazil have 41 points and had already qualified as group winners months ago. The other three advancing Tuesday went in this order: Uruguay (31), Argentina (28) and Colombia (27). \nUruguay and Colombia also qualify as Chile exit\nUruguay beat Bolivia 4-2, Colombia drew 1-1 with Peru and last-placed Venezuela beat Paraguay 1-0. Peru (26) placed fifth and will keep alive their bid for a first World Cup appearance since 1982 after edging Chile for the South American spot in the inter-continental playoff next month against Oceania representatives New Zealand. Brazil were fortunate enough to escape most of the drama but they still had a say in who would join them in Russia next year. And Chile, after a 3-0 loss to them, missed out along with Paraguay. Argentina had started the day outside the automatic qualifying positions, needing to secure their first win in Quito since 2001 to be certain of claiming at least a playoff place. It looked as if Argentina\u2019s worst fears were set to become a reality after Romario Ibarra gave Ecuador a 1-0 lead in the first minute at 2,850 metres (9,350 feet) in Ecuador\u2019s capital. \u201cEven with a goal against us you could see the certainty of a team that knew how to play the game,\u201d Sampaoli said. Messi for sure, and running mate Angel di Maria. Messi scored off a pass from Di Maria in the 12th, left-footing home from close range. In the 20th, Di Maria slipped a pass through to Messi, who drove the ball into the top corner from 15 yards. Messi then completed his hat-trick \u2014 the 44th of his dazzling career \u2014 with a sublime chip in the 62nd minute to make it 3-1. But while Argentina celebrated, it was a miserable night for Sampaoli\u2019s former team Chile. The Chileans were soundly beaten by Brazil in Sao Paulo to see themselves eliminated on goal difference. Barcelona\u2019s Paulinho opened the scoring before Manchester City\u2019s Gabriel Jesus bagged a brace to secure a win already-qualified Brazil which relegated Chile to sixth place in the standings. The Chileans finished level on points with Peru but trailed on goal difference. Chile coach Juan Antonio Pizzi announced his resignation following the exit. \u201cI take full responsibility,\u201d Pizzi told reporters. \u201cWe gave everything but it was not enough. I will not continue.\u201d The result marks the end of a brilliant run by the Chileans, who won the last two Copa America tournaments in 2015 and 2016 and qualified for the last two World Cups. \n\nLIMA: Colombia\u2019s James Rodriguez celebrates after scoring during the World Cup qualifier against Peru at the Nacional Stadium.\u2014Reuters\n\n\n\u201cMy soul is destroyed,\u201d Arturo Vidal, the midfield dynamo who missed the match through suspension, wrote on social media. \u201cThanks boys, for everything, for all these years together giving our lives in every game.\u201d A second-half goal from Paolo Guerrero kept Peru in with a chance of a first World Cup appearance since 1982 when his brilliant free kick in Lima cancelled out Colombia\u2019s opener from James Rodriguez. Peru, unbeaten in their last six qualifiers under Argentina manager Ricardo Gareca, failed to secure the win that would have ensured automatic qualification but have the consolation of a home-and-away playoff against New Zealand.  \u201cTo be in this position was one of our targets for the qualifiers,\u201d Gareca said after the draw. \u201cThere\u2019s 180 minutes left.

The objective was straightforward: To explore China, find out whether it is actually difficult for expats to travel freely in the country as portrayed in the international media, know whether the Chinese really love Pakistanis the way we have been taught throughout our lives, and finally, to defy the general perception that Pakistanis lack the spirit of adventure. We chose the Shandong Peninsula because of its historical importance, attractive scenery, diverse cuisine, and rich culture. Besides, it was close to Qingdao where we live. \n\nStarting point: Ocean University of China. - All photos by the authors\n\n\nThe Shandong Peninsula is located in the Shandong province in eastern China, between the Bohai Sea to the north and the Yellow Sea to the south. The peninsula\u2019s territory comprises three major cities of  the Shandong province: Qingdao in the southwest, Yantai in the north and centre, and Weihai at the eastern tip. Besides these three prefecture-level cities, the peninsula has many county-level cities and villages as well.We opted for bicycles because of their simplicity, slowness of pace, and the worm\u2019s-eye view they allow a rider to have. On a bicycle, one does not just observe the scenery but gets absorbed by it. For students like us, bicycling is an economic, healthy and environment-friendly way of travelling as well.\n\nChaoshi (Chinese for supermarket).\n\n\nThe tour was a completely new experience for us. Even though we had explored Qingdao and its districts on bicycle before, we had never done a long distance cycling tour prior to this. It was imperative that we not allow our inexperience to triumph and so, in order to make our trip safe and sound, we arranged all necessary equipment. We took with us our cycling toolkits, some extra tyre tubes, an air pump, rain coats, air pillows, etc. We set off on April 22, 2017. We planned the trip as a point A to point A tour, starting from our university, Ocean University of China, in Qingdao and returning right where we began on May 5, 2017. In the course of our journey, we passed by more than 12 prefecture-level and county-level cities: Qingdao, Jimo, Laixi, Zhaoyuan, Longkou, Penglai, Changdao, Yantai, Weihai, Rongcheng, Rushan, and Haiyang. We rode through the difficult terrains of rural Shandong as well as on the smooth roads along the coasts of the Yellow Sea and the Bohai Sea, covering a distance of more than 1,000 kilometres. \n\nFuelling just before the high altitude biking in rural Longkou.\n\n\nInitially, it was tough to cycle on the relatively hilly roads of Shandong with the considerable amount of weight of the equipment loaded on our bikes. But our stamina gradually grew, along with the strength in our thighs. Jimo was the first stopover. It is a county-level city close to Qingdao. One can take either the general traffic routes or the Yangkou Tunnel which is 3.8 kilometres long. We took the general traffic routes which run mostly through the main city area, but are often hampered by numerous traffic signals. It is a small city, but is home to some classical architecture and big shopping malls.The next destination was Laixi. We followed the rural traffic routes to get to Liaxi, which were often crowded with heavy vehicles, but one got to see the rural life. \n\nAn evening of traditional dance and music with elderly Chinese in Laixi.\n\n\nLaixi is known for its slower pace of life. In the evening, residents can be seen fishing and exercising at the Moon Lake Park.We also spent an evening with the elderly Chinese exercising in the park. They welcomed us to participate in their exercise activity which included traditional music and dance. On our third day, we arrived in Zhaoyuan, another county-level city located on the seashore of the Bohai Sea. We had again taken the rural traffic routes but encountered light rain on our way. Riding in the rain was quite a novel experience, but the best part was that we came across so many people who offered help. They gave us umbrellas, raincoats, and asked us to take shelter in their shops. Some also offered us hot drinking water. \n\nA glittering bridge in Zhaoyuan.\n\n\n\nMaking our way to Zhaoyuan through a village.\n\n\nWe learnt that drinking hot water is an old tradition here in China and is believed to be a source of good health. Be it summer or winter, one can see people carrying their own bottle of hot water. In Zhaoyuan, what we found particularly fascinating were its magnificent architecture and scintillating night views. At night, one can see bridges and high-rise buildings showered in beautiful, colourful lights, around a lake located just outside the main city. One can also find numerous parks and gardens within the city which make Zhaoyuan  green and tourist-friendly.\n\nA village near Nanshan.\n\n\n\nIt was a tough ride making it to the top.\n\n\nWe rode to Longkou next. Along the route, one can\u2019t miss the Nanshan Mountain Tourist Area. It is the first-ever AAAA-rated scenic area in the province - a rating that\u2019s given only to some of the most important cultural and historical places or buildings in China. The main attraction here is the Great Buddha. Weighing 380 tonnes and measuring 38.66 meters, it is the largest tin bronze sitting Buddha statue in the world.We rode up to the top of Nanshan on bicycle and it proved to be the toughest ride of our whole tour. The tourists were amazed when they discovered that we managed to ride up to the top on bicycle. We took a less familiar route to get to the summit in order to see and explore the rural life and the villages located around the Nanshan Mountain. Throughout the ride, we passed by quaint villages and stunning sceneries.  \n\nElderly Chinese working in the fields near Nanshan.\n\n\nWe noticed numerous elderly villagers working in the fields all day long. We learnt that since the youth is increasingly moving to the cities for education and employment, their parents and grandparents are left to tend the fields.Another observation we made was the community involvement in the protection of forests, water conservation, and tourism promotion. We came across many locals dressed in uniforms, tasked by the government for these purposes.Longkou is quite mountainous in the south and in the first half of our journey, we had to ride through the difficult terrains of rural Longkou. The second half of the journey started from Penglai and was mostly through the urban areas of Penglai, Yantai, and Weihai, and along the smooth coasts of the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea. \n\nEn route to Penglaige Scenic Area.\n\n\n\nA Qing Dynasty iron cannon of the First Opium War displayed in Penglaige, Penglai.\n\n\n\nHistoric carvings of words and poetry in Penglaige.\n\n\nIn Penglai, we spent two full days because there is so much to do and see. The special thing about Penglai is the Penglai Pavilion Scenic Area. One will find here ancient city walls, iron cannons, some small and medium-sized temples, an ancient light house, and lots of historic carvings of words and poetry. The main point of interest for us was the fort-like structure that occupies the mountain on the north of the shore. One can also take a cable car to the adjacent cliff with great aerial views of the Changdao Islands.\n\nHighlight of the day: Penglaige Tourism Area in Penglai.\n\n\n\nChangdao Island, a wonderful place famous for its rocky beaches.\n\n\n\nCulture and beaches, China has it all.\n\n\nChangdao Island is a wonderful place to see around Penglai. It is known for its rocky beaches and picturesque cliffs. The island is regularly served by both passenger and vehicle roll-on/roll-off ferry from Penglai and one can take their bikes on the ferry as well. But in order to do so, one needs to inform them beforehand because sometimes they may not allow it. We arrived in Yantai after riding along the scenic coast of Bohai Sea. Yantai is one of the major cities and the largest fishing port in the province. The best thing to do in Yantai is gaze at the Yantai skyline dotted with high-rise buildings, besides lying idly on the sandy beaches. \n\nA glimpse of the Yantai business hub from the coast of Bohai Sea.\n\n\nOur stay in Yantai was short but eventful. Our four star hotel\u2019s management asked us to take our bicycles to our bedrooms because they thought they wouldn\u2019t be safe in the car parking.Later, while in a park,  we unknowingly entered an army-controlled area adjacent to the park. The security officers inquired about us and let us go when they found out we are expats and exploring Shandong on bikes and had entered the place mistakenly. They dealt with us in a very friendly manner and asked us if we needed any help. We got to see the friendly and supportive attitude of Chinese officials in all the cities and villages we visited.\n\nMet a biker from Dalian.\n\n\nEn route to Weihai, we came across a Chinese biker who suggested that we visit the Yangma Island which is a few kilometres off the main Yantai-Weihai route. We crossed a long bridge and arrived on Yangma Island. The island is round-shaped and we actually rode around the entire island in a few hours. The place is mostly famous for horseback riding and antique horse-drawn carriage rides. \n\nBuzkashi demonstration in Weihai by young Mongol horsemen.\n\n\nFor Weihai, we dedicated two full days. It is the easternmost prefecture-level city of the province and an important seaport. The major landscapes of Weihai are the Happiness Gate and the Weihai International Bathing Beach, but for us the highlight of the day was the Huaxiacheng Tourist Scenic Area. It is a huge complex with a great number of tourist spots and activities. One can find a mixture of gardens, temples, traditional architecture, statues, museums, and shows. \n\nA glimpse of classical architecture in Weihai.\n\n\nThe most surreal part of the day was when we got to experience a level 7 earthquake in a special simulation room in the Weihai Air Defense Education Museum.It is a moveable wooden compartment which can house around 20 people. During the simulation, one can hold the steel frames fixed inside the room in order to keep one\u2019s balance. It was an absolutely thrilling undertaking. The presentation is part of a series of different shows meant for public education.\n\nExperienced a Level 7 earthquake at the Weihai Air Defence Education Museum.\n\n\nThe longest ride of our tour started from Weihai and ended in Rongcheng. We rode over 150 kilometres that day and even rode during the night for a couple of hours. Rongcheng is one of the most stunning county-level cities in Shandong. The must-see places here are Chengshantou and the Swan Lake. In order to get to Chengshantou, one needs to ride up the mountainous region in the extreme east of Rongcheng, which was a really challenging task. Chengshantou is located at the easternmost part of the Chengshan Mountain. It is also referred to as the Cape of Good Hope, as it is the first spot in China where people see the sun rise in the morning. An intriguing thing about Chengshantou is that one can go to the seaside from a hill via a deep, long and picturesque cave. \n\nSwan Lake is an ideal habitat for Whooper Swans.\n\n\nAnother must-see place in Rongcheng is the Swan Lake. It is an ideal habitat for swans that migrate from Siberia to this small fishing village to spend the winter. While making it to our final destination, Haiyang, we passed by the small but striking city of Rushan. It is a county-level city that borders Yantai to the north and looks out to the Yellow Sea to the south. In Haiyang, we were forced by the heavy rain to spend an extra day, but we managed to leave on the third day when it was lightly drizzling. The special thing about Haiyang is that it is strategically located in the centre of the prime tourist trio of Qingdao, Yantai and Weihai. One can travel to all these three major cities of the Shandong province directly from Haiyang. So our final ride was also from Haiyang back to Qingdao.\n\nWe did it! At Ocean University of China after completing our dream cycling tour.\n\n\nThroughout our journey, we were warmly welcomed by everyone we came across. The question on everyone\u2019s lips was, \u201cNi shi na gou ren (Where are you from)?\u201d The moment we said, \u201cWo shi Bajisitan ren (We are from Pakistan),\u201d their response was: \u201cHuanying lai dao Zhongguo, women shi feichang hao de pengyou (Welcome to China, we are very good friends).\u201d What we experienced was very different from what the international media says about China. Everyone including law enforcement officials were extremely supportive and helpful. We wrapped up our tour with a newfound determination that this surely can\u2019t be the end. We would really like to see all of China on two wheels one day. We strongly encourage everyone reading this to come and experience firsthand the diverse culture, economic prowess and the irresistible charm of China and its people.\nHave you travelled to places that are not commonly visited by tourists?

At least 43 Afghan soldiers were killed and nine wounded in a Taliban-claimed assault on a military base in southern Afghanistan which saw the militants blast their way into the compound with at least one explosives-laden Humvee \u2014 a tactic used in three separate attacks this week \u2014 the defence ministry said. A security source in Kandahar put the toll at 50 dead and 20 wounded. But the real figure is likely to be higher because Afghan officials habitually understate the actual number of casualties. \nA police headquarters in Ghazni also comes under attack\nThe militants razed the base in the Chashmo area of Maiwand district in Kandahar province to the ground, according to the ministry. \u201cUnfortunately there is nothing left inside the camp. They have burned down everything they found inside,\u201d defence ministry spokesman Dawlat Waziri said. Just two soldiers were known to have survived unscathed, with six unaccounted for, the ministry said, underscoring the shocking casualties that Afghan security forces have faced in their struggle to beat back the militants. More than 10 militants were killed, it added. US aircraft carried out an air strike during a counterterrorism operation in Maiwand on Thursday, a spokesman for US Forces in Kabul said, though he did not specify whether the target were militants at the base. Provincial officials said two Humvees were used in the attack which was condemned by President Ashraf Ghani. They said the assault might have been carried out with the help of insiders. The Taliban claimed the ambush in a message to journalists that said all 60 security personnel on the base were killed. Separately on Thursday, militants besieged a police headquarters in the south-eastern province of Ghazni, attacking it for the second time this week. Air strikes were called in to support embattled police personnel in the ongoing assault, which has killed two security forces so far, Ghazni provincial police chief Mohammad Zaman said. The strikes were not immediately confirmed by the US Forces. Officials said the earlier assault on the headquarters, which took place on Tuesday, left 20 people dead and 46 wounded. Thursday\u2019s attacks take the number of major assaults on security installations this week to four, with the total death toll climbing past 120, including soldiers, police and civilians. The Taliban used a Humvee as a bomb to blast their way into their targets in three out of the four assaults this week. The militants have been able to steal dozens of Humvees from security forces after taking over districts and raiding military bases across the country. US President Donald Trump vowed earlier this year to stay the course in Afghanistan, America\u2019s longest war.But the Taliban said the recent assaults were a \u201cclear message to the Americans and the Kabul government, that they cannot scare us with their new so-called strategy\u201d. \u201cWe are fighting back and winning on every front, Inshallah [God willing],\u201d spokesman Qari Yusuf Ahmadi said.Published in Dawn, October 20th, 2017\n", "title": "Afghan militants storm army base, kill 43 troops", "author": "AFP"}, "1367415": {"date": "October 31, 2017", "article": "LAHORE: The Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) has submitted a resolution to the Punjab Assembly, demanding abolition of entrance test for admission to medical and dental colleges.In her resolution, PTI MPA Nabeela Hakim Ali stated that hundreds and thousands of students and their parents were facing severe financial, academic and social issues owing to the entrance test that follow full-fledged FSc and equivalent examinations.

More than smoking, hunger or natural disasters. More than AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined.One out of every six premature deaths in the world in 2015 about 9m could be attributed to disease from toxic exposure, according to a major study released on Thursday in the Lancet medical journal. The financial cost from pollution-related death, sickness and welfare is equally massive, the report says, costing some $4.6 trillion in annual losses or about 6.2 per cent of the global economy.\u201cThere's been a lot of study of pollution, but it's never received the resources or level of attention as, say, AIDS or climate change,\u201d said epidemiologist Philip Landrigan, dean of global health at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, and the lead author on the report.The report marks the first attempt to pull together data on disease and death caused by all forms of pollution combined.\u201cPollution is a massive problem that people aren't seeing because they're looking at scattered bits of it,\u201d Landrigan said.Experts say the 9m premature deaths the study found was just a partial estimate, and the number of people killed by pollution is undoubtedly higher and will be quantified once more research is done and new methods of assessing harmful impacts are developed.Areas like Sub-Saharan Africa have yet to even set up air pollution monitoring systems. Soil pollution has received scant attention. And there are still plenty of potential toxins still being ignored, with less than half of the 5,000 new chemicals widely dispersed throughout the environment since 1950 having been tested for safety or toxicity.\u201cIn the West, we got the lead out of the gasoline, so we thought lead was handled. We got rid of the burning rivers, cleaned up the worst of the toxic sites. And then all of those discussions went into the background\u201d just as industry began booming in developing nations, said Richard Fuller, head of the global toxic watchdog Pure Earth and one of the 47 scientists, policy makers and public health experts who contributed to the 51-page report.\u201cTo some extent, these countries look to the West for examples and discussion, and we'd dropped it,\u201d Fuller said.Asia and Africa are the regions putting the most people at risk, the study found, while India tops the list of individual countries.One out of every four premature deaths in India in 2015, or some 2.5m, was attributed to pollution. China's environment was the second deadliest, with more than 1.8m premature deaths, or one in five, blamed on pollution-related illness, the study found.Several other countries such Bangladesh, Pakistan, North Korea, South Sudan and Haiti also see nearly a fifth of their premature deaths caused by pollution.Still, many poorer countries have yet to make pollution control a priority, experts say. India has taken some recent actions, such as tightening vehicle and factory emission standards and occasionally limiting the number of cars on New Delhi's roads. But they have done little about crop burning, garbage fires, construction dust or rampant use of the dirtiest fossil fuels.A court ban on firework sales before the Diwali festival didn't stop New Delhi residents from firing rockets and lighting crackers throughout Thursday night. They awoke on Friday morning to acrid, smoke-filled skies and levels of dangerous, lung-clogging particulate matter known as PM2.5 that went beyond 900 parts per million 90 times the recommended limit by the World Health Organization, and 22 times higher than India's own limits.\u201cEven though better pollution norms are coming in, still the pollution levels are continuously increasing,\u201d said Shambhavi Shukla, a research associate with the Delhi-based Center for Science and Environment, which was not involved in the Lancet study.To reach its figures on the overall global pollution burden, the study's authors used methods outlined by the US Environmental Protection Agency for assessing field data from soil tests, as well as with air and water pollution data from the Global Burden of Disease, an ongoing study run by institutions including the World Health Organization and the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.Even the conservative estimate of 9m pollution-related deaths is one-and-a-half times higher than the number of people killed by smoking, three times the number killed by AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, more than six times the number killed in road accidents, and 15 times the number killed in war or other forms of violence, according to GBD tallies.It is most often the world's poorest who suffer, the study found. The vast majority of pollution-related deaths 92pc occur in low- or middle-income countries, where policymakers are chiefly concerned with developing their economies, lifting people out of poverty and building basic infrastructure. Environmental regulations in those countries tend to be weaker, and industries lean on outdated technologies and dirtier fuels.In wealthier countries where overall pollution is not as rampant, it is still the poorest communities that are more often exposed, the report says.\u201cWhat people don't realize is that pollution does damage to economies. People who are sick or dead cannot contribute to the economy. They need to be looked after\u201d which is also costly, Fuller said.\u201cThere is this myth that finance ministers still live by, that you have to let industry pollute or else you won't develop,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just isn't true.\u201d The report cites EPA research showing that the US has gained some $30 in benefits for every dollar spent on controlling air pollution since 1970, when Congress enacted the Clean Air Act, one of the world's most ambitious environmental laws. Removing lead from gasoline has earned the US economy another $6tn cumulatively since 1980, according to studies by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.Some experts cautioned, however, that the report's economic message was murky. Reducing the pollution quantified in the report might impact production, and so would not likely translate into gains equal to the $4.6tn in economic losses.The report \u201chighlights the social and economic justice of this issue,\u201d said Marc Jeuland, associate professor with the Sanford School of Public Policy and the Duke Global Health Institute at Duke University, who was not involved in the study.Without more concrete evidence for how specific policies might lead to economic gains, \u201cpolicymakers will often find it difficult to take action, and this report thus only goes part way in making the case for action,\u201d he said.Jeuland also noted that, while the report counts mortality by each pollutant, there are possible overlaps, for example, someone exposed to both air pollution and water contamination and actions to address one pollutant may not reduce mortality.\u201cPeople should be careful not to extrapolate from the US numbers on net (economic) benefits because the net effects of pollution control will not be equivalent across locations,\u201d he said.The study's conclusions on the economic cost of pollution measure lost productivity and health care costs, while also considering studies measuring people's \u201cwillingness to pay\u201d to reduce the probability of dying. While these types of studies yield estimates at best, they are used by many governments and economists trying to understand how societies value individual lives.While there has never been an international declaration on pollution, the topic is gaining traction.The World Bank in April declared that reducing pollution, in all forms, would now be a global priority. And in December, the United Nations will host its first conference on the topic of pollution.\u201cThe relationship between pollution and poverty is very clear,\u201d said Ernesto Sanchez-Triana, a lead environmental specialist at the World Bank. \u201cAnd controlling pollution would help us address many other problems, from climate change to malnutrition. The linkages can't be ignored.\u201d\n", "title": "Study finds pollution is deadlier than war, disaster, hunger", "author": "AP"}, "1367520": {"date": "Updated October 31, 2017", "article": "More than 200 people are feared to have died when a tunnel caved in at North Korea's nuclear test site after its latest detonation, a Japanese news report said on Tuesday.A tunnel collapsed at Punggye-ri in early September, days after North Korea conducted its sixth and the largest underground nuclear test on September 3, TV Asahi said, quoting unnamed North Korean sources.Some 100 workers were lost in an initial collapse. Another cave-in occurred during rescue operations, leaving at least 200 people feared dead in total, the Japanese broadcaster said.The accident was triggered by the test, TV Asahi claimed. Experts have warned that the underground tests could cause the mountain to collapse and leak radiation into the atmosphere near China's border.

According to many reports, the smog is coming from the burning of agricultural waste in Indian Punjab, and satellite imagery actually shows the widespread prevalence of the farm fires. There is little to nothing that the provincial authorities here can do to reduce the intensity of the smog, although much can be done to mitigate its impact, such as issuing alerts and raising awareness about steps that citizens can take to protect themselves from its harmful effects. In addition, the capacity of public-sector hospitals to deal with smog-related respiratory ailments can also be increased.But when it comes to actually dealing with the causes, Pakistan needs a channel of communication open with the Indian government, preferably at the provincial level, to raise the matter formally. It is not clear whether the practice of burning agricultural waste is new and why smog of this kind has not been seen in the longer-term past.

Last year, the trade deficit touched $32bn, which was the highest in the country\u2019s history.The strolling to control the trade deficit, the government has moved from regulatory duties to non-tariff measures apparently to discourage imports. This step of non-tariff measures came to curtail imports after the imposition of regulatory duties on 26 new products (137 tariff lines) as well as hike in duty rates of 21 items (219 tariff lines).The rates of regulatory duties range from 10pc to 30pc on different items, which are generally consumed by affluent segment of society.The new regulations will apply on import of 581 tariff lines, which include products like dairy products, leather, animal, meat, tomatoes, potatoes, onions, garlic, vegetables, fruits etc. Most of these products were already subjected to regulatory duties as well.In the Import Policy Order 2016, the government had already put in place regulations for 439 and 157 tariff lines, respectively. The products notified on Friday will be in addition to the exiting ones. The new measures will now also give sweeping power to the customs officials while clearing goods at the ports.Under the regulations, goods clearance will require a certificate for compliance to quarantine requirements of animal quarantine department of ministry of food security and research Pakistan.In case of some products, clearance of import was linked with compliance to phytosanitary requirement and drawing of samples and testing of quality by Department of Plant Protection. Similarly, the importable product was also subject to valid special import permit, valid phytosanitary certificate and Plant Protection Release Order by Department of Plant Protection, Ministry of Food Security and Research.Earlier, there were no such stringent conditions attached with the import of these products. It was only mentioned in the Import Policy Order that the import of these products will be subject to the same terms and condition in the relevant act.\u201cWe have seen that products were cleared at import stage without looking into the quarantine phytosanitary requirement,\u201d an official of the commerce ministry said. These measures, according to the official, were not meant only to curtail imports but also aimed at checking import of substandard products especially food items.He said such measures were already in place in almost all countries including India. The authorities concerned were also directed to come up with similar regulations for all those tariff lines which were not covered so far. According to the FBR, the purpose of duties was to provide an enabling atmosphere for competition to local manufacturers and boost economic growth.The products which were subject to regulatory duties include betel nuts (Supari), betel leaves (Paan), cosmetics, fruit juices, tiles, footwear, tyres, handbags, tableware, kitchenware, and home appliances like air conditioners, refrigerators etc.The purpose of these duties is not the generation of revenue but to reduce the import bill of the country. \nMoreover, the local manufacturers or producers of such items would be able to better compete with the imported products, which is expected to improve Pakistan\u2019s economic growth and provide more employment.

Brazil face Ecuador in a 2018 FIFA World Cup qualifier on Thursday.\u2014AFP\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nMONTEVIDEO: Injury-hit Argentina resume their bid for a berth at the 2018 World Cup on Thursday as Brazil head into the latest round of South American qualifiers hoping to build on their Olympic gold medal triumph. In the five months since the last batch of games in South America\u2019s marathon qualifying campaign, both Brazil and Argentina have undergone massive upheaval, with each side parting company with their coaches. Brazil kissed goodbye to 1994 World Cup-winning captain Dunga after a dismal campaign in the Copa America Centenario which saw the five-time world champions knocked out in the group stage. Argentina meanwhile split with Gerardo Martino following his team\u2019s Copa America final defeat to Chile in June, a loss which prompted a tearful Lionel Messi to announce his retirement from international football. Messi was subsequently coaxed into a u-turn by new coach Edgardo Bauza, confirming in August that he would continue to be available. But the Barcelona superstar is uncertain for Thursday\u2019s showdown with historical rivals Uruguay in Mendoza, with the 29-year-old struggling to overcome a groin injury. Messi has travelled to Argentina to join the squad and was seen taking part in light drills in training on Tuesday. However at least two other key players \u2014 Manchester City\u2019s Sergio Aguero and Paris St Germain\u2019s Javier Pastore \u2014 are both definitely out. Aguero suffered a calf injury in Sunday\u2019s 3-1 win over West Ham while Pastore has a torn right calf muscle. Argentina, who face a trip to Venezuela next Tuesday after the Uruguay game, are currently third in the standings with 11 points after six of 18 games in the round-robin format. SUAREZ, GODIN BACK Uruguay, who will have star striker Luis Suarez and defensive linchpin Diego Godin back in the same starting XI for the first time since the qualifiers kicked off last October, lead the standings on goal difference from Ecuador with 13 points. While Bauza faces a difficult start to his reign against the in-form Uruguayans, Brazil have a potentially awkward trip to the thin air of Quito to face Ecuador. Although the Brazilians have an impressive overall record against Ecuador \u2014 winning 24 of 30 games since 1942 \u2014 the Selecao have never won a World Cup qualifier in Quito, which is situated a dizzying 2,850 meters (9,350 feet) above sea level. New Brazil coach Tite, appointed in June, has drawn heavily on Brazil\u2019s victorious Olympic squad for Thursday\u2019s game against Ecuador, which is followed by a challenging date with Colombia in Manaus next week. Barcelona superstar Neymar, Gabriel Jesus, Gabriel \u201cGabigol\u201d Barbosa and four other members of the Olympic squad are in the 23 for two games. Former Corinthians boss Tite warned Brazil \u2014 who are outside the automatic qualification positions after winning just two of their first six games \u2014 they could not afford to assume they would turn their campaign around. Brazil has never failed to qualify for a World Cup. \u201cWe\u2019re not in the qualification zone,\u201d Tite said. \u201cOf course there\u2019s a risk, if we don\u2019t accept to see the risk, we\u2019re fleeing reality. \u201cI\u2019m here because we haven\u2019t got the results.

Addressing a press conference, Mr Jaffery said tile and sanitary ware manufacturers support the 20pc increase in duty on import of tiles and ceramics, followed by imposition of 9-36 anti- dumping duty on imports of Chinese products. The move will help curb under-invoicing and dumping of inferior quality products in local market, he said. Mr Jaffery said importers were buying sub-standard tiles from different countries and dumping their excess inventories in Pakistan, affecting the sales of local manufacturers. Locally manufactured tiles are expensive due to 21pc sales tax, as well as high cost of inputs including wages and power prices, he added.He said anti-dumping duty on Chinese imports coupled with RD will give breathing space to the local manufacturing industry which is on the verge of collapse despite huge investments. Furthermore, it would also create opportunities for new investors and lead to job creation. Mr Jaffery claimed that in 2016-17, Shabbir Tiles suffered a huge loss of Rs190m due to dumping of imported tiles. He said the construction industry in Pakistan is growing each year which is resulting in high demand of ceramic and porcelain tiles. Most manufacturers are not utilising their full capacity due to the availability of huge volume of inferior quality imported products which have been dumped here, he said. The local industry, despite suffering huge losses, is producing tiles as shutting down businesses would directly affect the livelihood of millions labourers and white collar workers, he added.Published in Dawn, November 2nd, 2017\n", "title": "RD on imported tiles, sanitary ware welcomed", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter"}, "1362507": {"date": "October 09, 2017", "article": "KARACHI: The people in Karachi received some respite from Saturday\u2019s scorching heat as a little more sea breeze blew through the city on Sunday which pulled the mercury down by 2.3 degrees Celsius on the scale, said a weatherman.

Her elder brother, Nauman, was already awake and she could hear him pack his school bag. Outside, the sun was already glaring down on the tall green trees and the grass rustling in the air on the mountain slopes. She rushed to the bathroom, a tiny space just outside her house with a pit and a tap. She washed her face, came back in, zipped up her school bag and ran to school. She was wearing a bright red shalwar kameez, a dress she had slept in.Even at the tender age of around 14, Ambreen knew what part of her clothing she could not be careless about \u2014 a face-covering niqab that left a small space for her eyes to peer out. The stony path from her home to the paved road went steeply up the mountain. With the ease of someone who has been walking up and down that path for years, she hopped and skipped and ran all the way. Nauman was leading her as the two went past the trees bearing blood-red pomegranate blossoms and parrot-green walnut fruits. Also read: Of law and lore \u2014 Criminalising violence against womenThe government school in her village, Makol, is tucked away, almost invisibly, at the end of a narrow path covered by thick trees. A small peak, jutting out of a mountain, obscures its front gate. Most teachers at the school \u2013 including the principal \u2013 are men, and girls and boys study in the same classrooms. Girls wear niqab so that the men and the boys cannot see their faces.  When Ambreen returned home that day, her mother, Shamim Akhtar, was livid. Why did she not change her bright red clothes before going to school where there were so many men around, she asked her daughter. Ambreen tried to argue that she did not have time to change. Shamim would not hear it. \u201cYou are not going to school again,\u201d she told Ambreen. Shamim took her books away from her and confined her to the house. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmbreen\u2019s brother Nauman looks through his notebook  at his house in Makol |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nFarmaan Ali, a teacher at the school, remembers Ambreen as an intelligent girl, a bright student. She could be naughty and easily distracted because she was so young, but she was smart and curious and a good daughter to her mother, he says. After classes, he had often seen her carrying large water containers home for her mother\u2019s cooking and washing. Her obedience, however, did not stop Ambreen from resisting her confinement. She kept protesting. She wanted to go back to her studies. She would often pick up her notebooks and start scribbling in them or she took her brother\u2019s notebook and copied his lessons word for word. She was restless and often received beatings from her mother for talking back and asking to go back to her school. After her protests became too frequent to ignore, Shamim allowed her to go to a nearby madrasa for daily Quran lessons. Also read: Why people get killed over blasphemy in Pakistan?All that happened in 2015. Exactly a year after she had been banished indoors, Ambreen walked back to school. She was careful to keep well behind her brother so as to make sure he did not see her. She was more worried about her mother. Sooner or later, Shamim would find out that Ambreen was missing from home. She quietly walked into her old classroom. It had changed. Other children had moved into it.\n\u201cThe entire Makol came to see the vans but Ambreen\u2019s mother did not,\u201d says Mustafa.\nAfter her arrival at school, a cousin of hers, who also studied there, went to the teacher Ali and asked him not to give Ambreen any books. She is not supposed to be in school, the girl told the teacher. Ali discussed the matter with the principal, Khaliquz Zaman, and they decided to summon Ambreen\u2019s brother, Nauman. They sent her back home with him. An angry Shamim gave Ambreen a serious thrashing but soon everything went back to business as usual. Ambreen helped her mother clean the house before everyone went to bed. Lying in his cot, Nauman could hear Ambreen sob. That was April 29, 2016 \u2014 a moonlit night. Everything outside seemed to be bathed in a heavenly glow. By 11 pm, Shamim and Nauman fell fast asleep. Between midnight and 2 am, some men came in and took Ambreen away. Whether or not her mother knew is not clear. \n \n(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; \n\t\t\t\t\tjs = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"; \n\t\t\t\t\tfjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, \"script\", \"facebook-jssdk\"));\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMubashir Zaidi, Zarrar Khuhro and Alia Chughtai talk to Annie Ali Khan about 'Pakistan's Missing Daughters' on Zara Hat Kay, Dawn News\n\n\n\nZarnab Gul lives on a hilltop in Makol. It was very early that morning when he heard screams. He opened the window of his room and looked out. He saw a big blaze below \u2014 at a place where a dusty shoulder jutted out of the village\u2019s sole paved link with other villages and towns. Such shoulders are common on roads passing through hilly areas and are meant to provide parking space for broken-down vehicles or for travellers to wait for a bus. Gul called his wife and they went to their rooftop to see what was burning along the road outside. They could not make out anything. He shouted loudly to see if whoever was screaming would answer. He heard back nothing but screams. Gul eventually went down to the road. He saw a van on fire. The flames were leaping towards another van parked nearby. Gul knew the owner of the second van \u2013 a twenty-five-year old local driver Ghulam Mustafa. He dialled Mustafa\u2019s cell phone number and asked him to come over. By the time Mustafa reached the spot, the fire had died out but his vehicle was all burnt down.  Also read: The perils of Pakistani migrants heading to EuropeGul and Mustafa went closer to the vans to see their condition. Both froze with horror when they saw that there was a person sitting inside the first van \u2014 burnt to a cinder. The arms and legs of the body, relatively recognisable, suggested it was a girl. The two also spotted a school bag inside the van. \u201cI was surprised that the bag was still intact,\u201d says Mustafa. \u201cNothing could have survived that blaze.\u201d It was dawn by then. Ali, the school teacher, heard an announcement from a local mosque about a dead body lying in a van on the roadside. He walked down the hill from his house and saw a crowd moving in the direction of the van. When he reached the place where the van was parked, he saw the singed body of a young girl tied to a seat. There were notebooks inside a school bag tucked in her hands. Those belonged to Nauman, Ambreen\u2019s brother. The girl in the van, according to her autopsy report, was strangled before she was set on fire. Her hands and legs were also tied with some plastic material to ensure that she did not move out of the van. When the police arrived, they concluded from the notebooks that the dead girl was Ambreen.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe interior of the burnt van |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWhile everyone rushed to the spot where the body was found, Shamim stayed at home even though she lived only a short walk away. \u201cThe entire Makol came to see the vans but Ambreen\u2019s mother did not,\u201d says Mustafa.Shamim says she did not notice anything unusual when she woke up that morning, except that the door of her single-room house was open. She went out to the bathroom, washed herself, offered her prayers and went back to sleep. She says she heard announcements about the burnt body of a young girl but she did not pay attention. When Nauman was leaving for school at around 7:30 am, Shamim asked him to wake Ambreen. That is when, she claims, they realised that she was missing. Shamim ran out of the house and checked in the bathroom and the thickets close by but Ambreen was nowhere to be found. She went to the neighbours and asked them about her daughter but no one had seen her that morning.Her statement triggers some troubling questions. She was sleeping right next to her daughter in a small room. How could she not know if someone came in and took the girl away? Why did she not notice Ambreen\u2019s absence before her son told her about it?Also read: What it means to be free in PakistanThe police detained Shamim and Nauman and took them to the police station. They were both beaten up. Shamim was slapped and the soles of her feet were struck hard with sticks. \u201cYou can beat me as much as you want,\u201d she cried, \u201cbut I have not killed my daughter. Why would I kill my own flesh and blood?\u201d She was released, along with Nauman, for lack of evidence.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIllustration by Samya Arif\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nShamim\u2019s husband, Riasat Khan \u2013 a small, gaunt old man with a shrunken, bearded face \u2013 is a labourer working in a ship-breaking yard in Gadani, Balochistan. He stays at his workplace, hundreds of kilometres away from Makol, for most part of the year. He was at work when his daughter\u2019s body was found. He reached home a couple of days after Ambreen had died. He says he has no clue what happened to her.   Shamim, younger than her husband and also more articulate and worldly-wise than him, does not like to talk much about her daughter. Instead, she mourns the death of her eldest born, a boy named Waseem, who had died of an unknown cause a few years ago. He was fine one day and then the next day he was bleeding from the mouth, she says. Within hours he was dead.  Shamim has a photo of Waseem. He seems to be in his early teens at the time the photograph was taken. She has no photograph of Ambreen that can enable an interested outsider to know what she looked like. \nThere is a notebook in his hands. Ambreen used to scribble and doodle in it. He is also drawing something \u2014 a mishmash of lines and spirals, like the mystery surrounding his sister\u2019s death.\nIn the sparse room where Ambreen\u2019s family lives, there is almost nothing that suggests that the girl even existed. A small stove next to a low wooden shelf in a corner of the living room-cum-bedroom marks the kitchen area where a few tin containers carrying cooking oil and some spices are lined neatly. Next to them are pots and pans and a couple of trunks with clothes in them. The bright red dress Ambreen wore to school last year could be in one of those trunks, but there is no way of knowing that. Next to the trunks, charpoys are lined against a long wall facing the only opening in the room: its door. Ambreen used to sleep on one of those cots. As Nauman starts talking about Ambreen, his mother looks at him. He is sitting on a charpoy right opposite the door. There is a notebook in his hands. Ambreen used to scribble and doodle in it. He is also drawing something \u2014 a mishmash of lines and spirals, like the mystery surrounding his sister\u2019s death. Makol, located about 10 kilometres from the military\u2019s premier training facilities in Abbottabad district, is a typical settlement in the mountains: houses are scattered, separated by small hills, pathways and tree-lined courtyards. It consists of a few hundred houses. Most of them are built with bricks and mortar and have concrete roofs but a few are mud huts with thatched ceilings \u2013 like the one Ambreen\u2019s family has. In this village lives a rich man: Muhammad Pervaiz. His family owns vast tracts of land and many houses here. He is also the elected chairman of a union council of which Makol is a part, along with a few other villages.Last year, Pervaiz\u2019s young daughter Saima disappeared from home, allegedly with a man she wanted to marry. Her parents looked for her everywhere they could but did not find a clue of her whereabouts. There were rumours in Makol that Ambreen knew where Saima was. She reportedly was the human link through which Saima communicated with the man she loved.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe house of Muhammad Pervaiz, Saima\u2019s father, in Makol |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPervaiz is known to be unhappy about Ambreen\u2019s role in his daughter\u2019s disappearance. He is reported to have convened a council of the elders of the area in his home some time in 2015 where it was allegedly decided to punish Ambreen. It was not a jirga, a tribal judicial council, in the exact tribal sense because those living in Makol are not bound by any tribal affinity (they all come from different castes and working groups) and it had no legal and political legitimacy as the jirgas have in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. It is still reported to have the sanction of the rich and the influential in and around Makol. Shamim alleges it was Pervaiz who came to her house along with some other men on the night Ambreen disappeared. He took her away to question her about Saima\u2019s disappearance, Shamim says, but she does not have any evidence to substantiate her allegation. Others in the village speculate that she knew all along that Pervaiz was out to get her daughter. That is why she took Ambreen out of school soon after Saima had disappeared and the jirga had taken place, they say. \nSomething she has noticed in many similar cases: That a woman who leads a life of moral laxity always ends up dying in ignominy.\nPervaiz\u2019s wife, Rubina, a housewife reluctant to speak to an outsider, swears by her husband\u2019s innocence. \u201cHe was at home with me on the night of Ambreen\u2019s murder,\u201d she says. She also denies the allegations that the punishment for Ambreen was approved at a jirga held inside her home. \u201cThat was not a jirga. After Saima went missing, a few elders from the community talked to each other inside a closed room. There was no discussion on the subject ever afterwards,\u201d she says. Also read: Why divorce is close to impossible for Christians in PakistanRumours continue to swirl around the case. One of them joins Pervaiz and Shamim as secret lovers who killed Ambreen after she had come to know about them. According to another rumour, Shamim could have killed both Waseem and Ambreen for some unknowable reason.  Many weeks after Ambreen\u2019s murder, Safeer Ahmed, a junior court official in Abbottabad, a few kilometres to the north-west of Makol, insists that Shamim was \u201cinvolved\u201d in some kind of a \u201cracket\u201d and that is why she had her own \u201cdaughter killed to cover up her crime\u201d. Makol is a small place where everyone knows everyone, he says. \u201cIt is not a city. How can the mother not know the person who took her daughter away? There is some great secret here.\u201d\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWomen clad in burqas walk along a road near Dewal Sharif | Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPervaiz and around 10 others \u2013 including the owner of the van in which the body was found \u2013 were arrested in early May 2016 and are in jail pending a trial. The police are yet to release a complete forensic audit of the crime scene. A judicial inquiry into Ambreen\u2019s death, ordered by the provincial government, is also going on. Whoever killed Ambreen was both meticulous and methodical. According to police investigations and statements of witnesses who discovered her body, the killers had cut off electricity to the nearby street light and damaged the water pipeline passing through the place so that water to extinguish the fire could not be secured easily. Ambreen was dumped on a seat right above the van\u2019s gas tank. When the fire started, she did not burn slowly. The fireball cause by the gas roasted her body instantly. Her teacher, Ali, remembers how many in the crowd that April morning took photos and made videos of the crime scene. Those grainy and terrifying images and the recent renaming of the local school after her are the only signs that Ambreen did once exist. Even her grave in Makol graveyard remains unmarked: a small mound of dried earth with a shapeless piece of rock placed where a tombstone should have been.\n\n\n\nDewal Sharif is like Makol in many ways. Both are located in the same mountain valley that links the tourist resort of Murree in the south to Abbottabad in the north-west through scattered settlements nestled amid forest-covered ravines and snow-capped peaks. But Dewal Sharif is much bigger and, with its own commercial areas and multiple road links with the rest of the country, is more economically developed than Makol. And there are more private schools in Dewal Sharif than there are shops in Makol. Maria Sadaqat, a tall 19-year-old girl, was both a beneficiary and a contributor to this sprawling private education system. Her death on June 1, 2016 is also linked to it \u2014 albeit indirectly. Also read: Enforced disappearances: The plight of Kashmir's 'half widows'Many in this town of more than 10,000 people agree that Maria was a bright girl. Even when she was studying at a local school, she taught other students in her class. By the time she reached the second year of college, there was competition among the owners of private schools to hire her as a teacher. The head teacher at Al Abbas School \u2013 where Maria had done her primary and secondary schooling \u2013 was certain that she was going to teach at his school. Shaukat Abbasi, proprietor of the Suffa School of Modern Studies, believed she would join his institution. He was, after all, a close friend of Maria\u2019s father Sadaqat Abbasi. Sadaqat and Shaukat had become friends some years ago. The former was working as a driver then and the latter as a Grade-17 government officer. They, respectively, came from the relatively poor lower part of Dewal Sharif town and its better off upper part. It was originally a case of a small man trying to be seen as being close to a big man; a way of gaining some social and financial traction in a highly hierarchical society. Then Shaukat gave Sadaqat some money to set up his own chicken coop. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe main road of Dewal Sharif  |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPerhaps to return his favour, Sadaqat decided that Maria would teach at Shaukat\u2019s school after she passed her intermediate exam. All her younger siblings \u2013 five sisters and a brother \u2013 were also to attend the same school as students. Her colleagues at the school liked Maria but they thought she was a little odd for a girl of her age. Firstly, she was a couple of inches taller than most women around her and then she did not wear any make-up other than an occasional application of kohl to her eyes. The teachers felt \u201cembarrassed standing next to her\u201d, a member of her family recalls. She had one foible though \u2014 she liked spending money on buying watches. One of her watches had a small dial with a long thin leather strap. She wore it on most workdays. The other one looked like a gold bracelet that she paired with pearl earrings. Recently, she had started wearing a delicate gold nose ring that her grandmother had bought for her. These distinctions apart, she wore a black abaya, as did all other teachers working with her, while walking to and from the school. It had a sprinkling of black shiny objects on the shoulders and across the front. And like most teenage girls, she loved bags. Her shoulder bag was made of imitation fur and leather \u2014 a popular design sold everywhere in Murree\u2019s bazaars.Maria was friendly and confident and had the talent for putting people at ease with her conversation. Her friends and family say she always had a story or two to tell. She was obviously an object of envy among her peers. Her father was very proud of her. Maria had brought him prestige in the community and additional cash to his family kitty. Some months after Maria started teaching at Shaukat\u2019s school, Sadaqat developed business problems with her boss. Accounts differ. Sadaqat says Shaukat was his business partner \u2014 they shared profit and loss. When the business was doing well, Shaukat was receiving his share of the profit but when sales and profits were badly hit, he started asking for his money back. Shaukat says he had given the money to Sadaqat as a loan. At first Shaukat did not press his demands much. Sadaqat, in the meanwhile, went to Saudi Arabia on a work visa as a labourer. It was then that the environment started changing for Maria at the school. Rumours began circulating that Shaukat had sent a marriage proposal to Maria for his son \u2014 an already married man with a child who also taught at another private school. Others suggested that Maria and Shaukat\u2019s son were having a secret affair. To avoid the scandal to blow up in her face, she quit her job. Her siblings were also transferred to a different school. [Also read: The evolution of honour killing]17The relationship between Sadaqat and Shaukat was steadily souring all this while, especially after Sadaqat came back from Saudi Arabia, abandoning his contract halfway. Almost penniless, he started a vehicle repair shop in the market area in lower Dewal, where Shaukat appeared regularly, demanding his money back in full view of other people. The two often exchanged hot words. One day in May this year, the two men almost came to blows. But Shaukat backed off, sensing that the much younger and fitter Sadaqat would outdo him easily in a fist fight. Sadaqat, though, believed the quarrel was not over. The next day, he left Dewal to attend a funeral in the nearby town of Phagwari. All the elders of his family and five of his children went with him. Maria was left at home to take care of her special-needs sister, six-year-old Habiba. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe area in front of Maria\u2019s house where she was thrown off a slope after being burnt |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAt 11:45 am that day, Shaukat \u2013 along with four or five other people \u2013 arrived at Maria\u2019s house, a small three-room stand-alone house on a hillock. He called her outside. As soon as Maria opened the gate, the men slapped her and pulled her to a clearing where some goats were tied. They ripped her clothes and beat her in turns, making a circle around her. \u201cYou are stalking my son. Today, I will set you on fire,\u201d Shaukat said to her. The men forced her to the ground. Shaukat took out a plastic container, threw kerosene oil on Maria and set her ablaze. She screamed for help but no one came to her rescue. The men then threw her down a nearby mountain slope. She landed on a path, many feet below. This is how the events of the day transpired, according to the statement that Maria gave to the police from a hospital bed and the accounts of her family. Her neighbour\u2019s son, a 12-year-old, was playing on the rooftop of his house when he heard someone screaming. He rushed to Maria\u2019s house where the screams were coming from. He found her lying on the path, still in flames with her clothes ripped at many places. He called his sister. She gave Maria water to drink and called Sadaqat, who came back home and took Maria to a government hospital in Phagwari.    Also read: Republic of fearThe hospital did not have any facilities to treat burn victims. He eventually shifted her to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for treatment. Maria lay there in a bed, fully conscious for 36 hours. She recorded her statement \u2013 an audio and a video \u2013 describing her attackers in detail. On her last day in the hospital, an uncle roughly the same age and with the same white beard as Shaukat, came to see her. She screamed in terror. \u201cMaster Shaukat is here to burn me,\u201d she cried. \u201cBaba, throw him out.\u201dShe died the same day. Seen in her pictures, Maria looks like a younger version of her grandmother, Subeda \u2014 same height, same straight nose, same high cheekbones and same curious brown eyes. Subeda wants the courts to give Shaukat the same punishment he has inflicted on her granddaughter \u2014 death by fire. Maria\u2019s father has the same demand. Sadaqat and his family, however, seem more sad than angry. \u201cFor me, she was a son,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my children are very bright but Maria was exceptionally intelligent.\u201d While the financial dispute between Sadaqat and Shaukat is well known in Dewal Sharif and rumours about the latter\u2019s desire to make Maria his daughter-in-law are widespread, few men outside Maria\u2019s family believe that he killed her. Many of them are willing to vouchsafe for Shaukat\u2019s good character; others remember him as one of the best and the most respected educationists in the area. After the police arrested him and put him behind bars, there were, indeed, public marches in Dewal Sharif in his favour. Many female teachers and students also participated in those. \n\u201cShe is already dead and she has also named me, but as a human being I feel sad over her death,\u201d he says calmly\nMembers of Maria\u2019s family allege that Shaukat was enraged because she had refused to become the second wife of his son. \u201cHe kept threatening her,\u201d says Maria\u2019s aunt Sobia. \u201cIf you don\u2019t marry my son then I will make sure you marry no one else,\u201d she quotes Shaukat as telling her niece.I manage to sneak inside Rawalpindi\u2019s Adiala Jail on June 28, 2016, to have a meeting with Shaukat. We talk in a room full of people where the prisoners stand on one side in a cage-like iron structure and their visitors on the other side, both groups trying to have a conversation through tiny holes in steel sheets separating them.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMaria (centre) with her sisters |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nHe looks older than he did in a video of him available online. He also appears withdrawn. He acknowledges his verbal squabble with Sadaqat and also claims that he backed off that day in May in the market so that he could avoid getting hurt. But he denies even being in Dewal Sharif the day Maria was burnt. \u201cI had gone to a village 45 kilometres from Dewal to enquire about an ailing friend.\u201d Shaukat says he came to know about the incident through a phone call. \u201cThen I heard Maria\u2019s father had nominated me and my neighbour for the crime. We ran away initially but surrendered a few days later.\u201d He insists that he never saw Maria after she had left his school. \u201cShe has given her pre-death statement under dictation from her father,\u201d says Shaukat.  Maria\u2019s family members say they kept asking Shaukat to come forward and clear his name while the girl was still alive. He did not do that. \u201cThe media was baying for blood. How could I risk my life by going there?\u201d he responds. Shaukat also denies that he ever asked for Maria\u2019s hand for his son. \u201cI swear I never talked about marrying the two,\u201d he says. As I start to leave, he stops me. \u201cShe is already dead and she has also named me, but as a human being I feel sad over her death,\u201d he says calmly, showing no outward signs of agitation, anger or animosity. \u201cI really feel sorry for her,\u201d he adds. In his online video, apparently made when he was being investigated by the police, he makes a passionate plea about his innocence. \u201cI have a grown-up daughter of my own. Those who have grown-up daughters of their own don\u2019t eye other people\u2019s daughters.\u201d Given Maria\u2019s last statement and the media\u2019s coverage of the incident, it looked unlikely that Shaukat would be released from jail any time soon. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMaria\u2019s personal belongings |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe police investigations, however, soon absolved him of the accusations. A few weeks ago, a committee formed by Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif to investigate Maria\u2019s death declared that she had \u201ccommitted suicide and was not murdered.\u201d  According to a report published in daily Dawn on July 2, 2016, the \u201ccommittee headed by Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Abubakar Khuda Dad Khan, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Khuda Bux Cheema and Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Ghasud Deen analysed forensic data, obtained polygraph tests, mobile phone records, fingerprints, medical reports, talked to doctors and conducted interviews in order to ascertain the cause of death.\u201d The officers recommended releasing Shaukat and two of his alleged accomplices.They were released on bail soon afterwards.   The police are also said to have leaked Maria\u2019s cell phone data. It showed she was exchanging amorous messages quite regularly with Shaukat\u2019s son. Asma Jahangir, the renowned human rights lawyer and activist, visited Maria\u2019s home as part of a three-member fact-finding mission sent by the Supreme Court Bar Association soon after the incident of her burning. Jahangir has seen her autopsy report and spoken to her family. She has also met Maria\u2019s neighbours who were the first ones to hear her screams. She says she found Dewal Sharif divided along gender lines over Maria\u2019s death. The women were \u201cin full sympathy with the victim whereas the men were either justifying [the] crime or denying it totally,\u201d says the mission led by Jahangir in its recently released report. \u201cThere was a concerted effort to paint the occurrence as a suicide rather than murder,\u201d it adds. \u201cIt was obviously not a suicide. It was murder,\u201d Jahangir says in her office in Lahore. \nThey are straightforward murders, disguised as honour killings to escape punishment\nShe cites Maria\u2019s postmortem report to say that her hands, feet and head were unburnt. This, she says, suggests that more than one person held her down to the ground while she was being set ablaze. The fact-finding mission report quotes one Ejab Abbasi, chairman of union council Dewal Sharif, as saying that he met Maria in hospital twice to probe her thoroughly. \u201cThe victim was absolutely certain and remained consistent about her version of the incident,\u201d he is reported to have told the members of the mission.  Jahangir says she also tried to meet Shaukat\u2019s family but they were unable to meet the mission for unspecified reasons. She clarifies that it was not her mandate to find out who had killed Maria. \u201cMy mission was to ensure that the investigation was carried out independently. There was obviously a lot of prejudice against the girl. I wanted to ensure that the rumours did not sidetrack legal proceedings.\u201d The fact-finding mission initially \u201cwas quite satisfied with the inquiry\u201d but its members were \u201cshocked to know that the investigation had declared the main accused as being innocent\u201d. They also point out that a magistrate hearing the case did not accept the police recommendation to release the accused \u201cand yet bail was granted\u201d to him. The report lists developments that might have had some negative impact on the investigation. \u201cThere was a campaign of character assassination of the victim and her family and \u2026 there were credible reports that the family members were being threatened and induced to accept some reward for their silence.\u201d  Jahangir points to a widespread public perception, especially among men, in Dewal Sharif \u2014 something she has noticed in many similar cases: That a woman who leads a life of moral laxity always ends up dying in ignominy. \n\n\n\nHe passed through her street every day. She waited for him half-hidden behind a half-open door. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look my way? Why don\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d she gathered the courage to ask him one day. \u201cI have nothing to offer,\u201d he replied. \u201cI want nothing,\u201d she said. Muqaddas Bibi was a young girl with a soft face. \u201cShe was the daughter of a potter but she looked like she belonged to a family of Rajputs,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother says. Taufiq Ahmed is a handsome young man with a thick mustache and thick wavy black hair, oiled and slicked back stylishly. One of his legs is shorter than the other but that is barely noticeable. He works as a tailor. The two lived in the same Buttranwali village, a nondescript settlement a little off the road that connects Gujranwala with Sialkot \u2014 nestled amid green fields being steadily taken over by ramshackle housing and brick kilns. They came from two different castes and their financial status varied. Though the girl\u2019s family was poor a couple of generations ago, they have been doing well of late and are regarded well off by the village\u2019s standards. Ahmed comes from a family of carpenters which struggles to make ends meet even when some of its members have branched into other professions. They had no chance of having an arranged marriage.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaufiq Ahmed |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThree years ago, the two ran away and got married in a court.At first Ahmed\u2019s family was hesitant to accept Muqaddas into its fold but she took to her married life wholeheartedly. \u201cShe made rotis every day for the family, washed clothes and was always helping everyone,\u201d says Ahmed\u2019s mother. Everyone in the family and the neighbourhood soon started liking Muqaddas. An elderly woman living next door to her would come to her complaining of headache and Muqaddas would apply oil to her hair to massage and soothe her. Ahmed lives in a small single-storey home made of red bricks, unplastered and unpainted. It is hard to distinguish from other houses in the village. His entire family has one room to sleep in \u2014 a simple structure with bare walls, save for a couple of framed images of the Kaaba. Ahmed works from 7 am to 11 pm in one corner of the house, making about fifteen thousand rupees a month by stitching clothes. Muqaddas would serve him tea every few hours. \n \u201cOnce women become independent, they also get a mind of their own and want to marry of their own choice. This is seen as a major contravention of family boundaries.\u201d\nAbout a year ago, they had a daughter. A few months after her birth, Muqaddas became pregnant again. She was happy about her second child. The delivery was still two months away but she made new clothes for herself to wear after she had given birth. One day this June, she felt ill and Ahmed\u2019s mother offered to take her to a hospital. They were to take a bus to Gujranwala, slightly more than 10 kilometres away. While Muqaddas and her mother-in-law were waiting at a bus stop, her mother arrived there and grabbed Muqaddas by the hair and the neck. \u201cIt all happened so fast,\u201d says Ahmed\u2019s mother, \u201cthat I did not know what to do.\u201d Before anyone could come to their help, Muqaddas\u2019 mother had dragged her daughter into her house and closed the door from inside.As a crowd gathered outside, the mother screamed at the daughter. \u201cWhy did you marry a cripple?\u201d Other members of the family were also present inside the house and they are known to have beaten up one of Muqaddas\u2019 sister-in-law for trying to help her. Within minutes, the mother took out a knife and slit the daughter\u2019s throat. As Muqaddas lay dying, people waiting outside tried to enter the house but could not. \u201cThey must have planned for a long time,\u201d says a visibly angry Ahmed. \u201cOur women seldom leave the house. They have been waiting for a chance all this time to grab her.\u201d \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMuqaddas Bibi\u2019s husband Taufiq Ahmed with his daughter and mother |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe old woman who liked Muqaddas for oiling her hair curses the girl\u2019s mother. \u201cThe whole neighbourhood is in shock,\u201d she says crying. \u201cThis is not about honour. Once the girl had become a mother, the question of honour died there and then.\u201d Ahmed\u2019s mother now looks after his daughter. \u201cWhat will this little girl think when she grows up?\u201d she asks before she starts crying. \u201cI am going to take good care of our child,\u201d Ahmed says, lifting his daughter in his arms.Muqaddas is buried in a grave behind a wall forming the village\u2019s boundary. There is an empty bottle of camphor and fresh flowers lying on the grave. Back at his home, Ahmed takes out an album carrying the photos of the couple. In one photo, a heart pierced by an arrow overlaps them as they pose for the camera. \u201cI want to ask the world, if love is forbidden then why did God give us a heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf these people call themselves believers, do they not believe that couples are made in heaven?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe months of May and June this year have been the cruelest. Violence against women has been rampant during this period. In May alone, the national media reported at least five cases in which women were murdered \u2014 in most instances by their close relatives. Zeenat Bibi\u2019s killing stands out among all these cases for multiple reasons. An 18-year-old girl living in a working class neighbourhood in southern Lahore, she was burnt to death on June 8 by her mother, Parveen Rafiq. This is the first known incident this year of a girl torched to death by her own family. Zeenat also did not belong to a village where some supposedly primitive anti-women social code operated. She lived and was killed in the second biggest city in the country where tribal concepts of male honour look distinctly unfeasible to follow. And she was killed by her mother \u2014 not by her brother or father though they may have a role in it. Yet the cause of her death is what it has always been in such cases: \u201cbringing shame to the family,\u201d as her mother put it, according to a report published by daily Dawn. Parveen, who confessed to her crime and is undergoing trial, set Zeenat on fire more than a week after the girl had reportedly eloped with one Hassan Khan. The two had married in court. \u201cHassan had agreed to let his wife return [to her parents\u2019 home] after her family promised ... to organise a traditional wedding reception for the couple,\u201d the newspaper reports.  Less than a week before the girl was murdered, the neighbours had seen her brother carrying home a jerrycan of petrol. The fire that killed Zeenat was so big that it was extinguished only with help from the official rescue service. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaufiq Ahmed shows a dress belonging to his wife |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAmmar Majeed, who works at Jahangir\u2019s law firm, AGHS Associates, as a media officer, has been visiting homes from where violence against women is reported. He has seen cases similar to that of Zeenat\u2019s. In his reckoning, these \u201care crimes of ego\u201d that \u201chave nothing to do with honour.\u201d A mother, upset that her daughter did not listen to her before deciding who to marry, resorts to killing not in order to redeem her honour but to satisfy her pride.  From experience, Majeed knows that such pandering to the self often has a destructive outcome. He once asked a boy why he had killed his sister. \u201cBecause it was satisfying,\u201d is the answer he got. Khawar Mumtaz, a veteran of the women\u2019s rights movement in Pakistan, has worked in different capacities over the last three and a half decades \u2014 first as a member of the Women\u2019s Action Forum (WAF), then as a founding member and head of the Aurat Foundation, a Lahore-based lobbying and research group on women\u2019s rights, and recently as the chairperson of the National Commission on the Status of Women. \u201cMost cases of violence against women in the 1980s were reported from tribal areas in Sindh and Balochistan,\u201d she says. The situation has only worsened over the years as similar cases are being reported from everywhere in the country. One reason, according to Mumtaz, is that the economic, social and political environment is changing in Pakistan. \u201cWomen are doing much better economically, politically and socially as compared to the past,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen are marrying late. More and more women are working.\u201d This, she says, is one of the major factors in the backlash against them. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe graveyard in Butranwali, Punjab where Muqaddas Bibi is buried | Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nMumtaz points to \u201ca total disjuncture\u201d between how the society is moving ahead and how social structures and social roles are still playing out in the same old ways. She gives an example: \u201cOnce women become independent, they also get a mind of their own and want to marry of their own choice. This is seen as a major contravention of family boundaries.\u201d That explains why it has become acceptable that a woman can work to provide for her family but it is still not acceptable if she exercises choice in marriage. \u201cViolence then is likely. It is part of a control mechanism.\u201dShahnaz Rouse, a professor of sociology at the Sarah Lawrence College in the United States, has also written about social and political changes that have led to an increase in violence against women in Pakistan. In her book, Shifting Body Politics: Gender, Nation, State in Pakistan, she sees the crucial shift in attitudes towards women having resulted from the militarisation and progressively increasing masculinisation of society itself since the military regime of General Ziaul Haq. Freely available arms and ammunition and Pakistan\u2019s status as a frontline state during the war in Afghanistan and the drug trade are some of the contributing factors to the social changes she highlights. \u201cThe militarisation of the state and civil society [is] a result of the international/global politics of the last two decades, combined with the collapse of the liberalisation policies of regimes following Zia \u2026 the continued reliance by all three [regimes] on \u201cIslamic\u201d ideology as constructed by increasingly militant and conservative religious groups for \u201cstrategic\u201d and/or ideological purposes, have resulted in an alarming masculinisation of public space.\u201d \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA photo taken in Asma Jahangir's office in Lahore | Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe Other Side of Silence: Voices from the Partition of India by Urvashi Butalia goes another step backwards. Her book deals with one of the most brutal manifestations of the notion of shame and honour being linked to women and their bodies on a mass scale. Women were humiliated by being paraded naked in the streets or forced to abandon their religion and marry their rapists, never to see their families again during the cataclysmic events of 1947. Thousands of them died willingly at the hands of their own men to avoid bringing shame and dishonour to their families.  \u201cThey are straightforward murders, disguised as honour killings to escape punishment,\u201d Butalia said in an interview about some recent incidents of violence against women in India.  The word honour invariably appears in news reports covering violence against women. Maqsooda Solangi, who has been working for the Aurat Foundation for six years, believes that many crimes are seen as honour killings because the media portrays them as such. \u201cNews contents are spiced up,\u201d she says.  The situation is particularly bad at relatively small Punjab-based Urdu language newspapers. Whenever an honour crime occurs, it is covered in a way that focuses on the love marriage aspect of it, Solangi says. She adds that the coverage of crimes against women in local-language newspapers in Sindh is not as salacious as it is in Punjab.  It was during Zia\u2019s era that honour killing first entered the lexicon of the news media and human rights activists, Mumtaz says. It has its origin in a 1979 judgement by the Peshawar High Court that declared that Islamic concepts of qisas (retribution) and diyat (compensation) must be taken into account before deciding any cases involving the death penalty. Awarding capital punishment without any provision for forgiveness is un-Islamic, the court ruled. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGraffiti  against domestic violence along a road in Abbottabad |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nIn politics, this put Zia\u2019s self-professed Islamist regime in an uncomfortable position as far as hanging \u2013 without provision for forgiveness \u2013 of deposed prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was concerned. The verdict also raised alarm among women\u2019s rights activists. It will lead to impunity for those men who kill their women because they can benefit from forgiveness \u2013 which in such cases is the prerogative of their own next of kin \u2013 is how the activists looked at the possible impacts of the law. They were proved right. The next decades saw a spike in crimes against women but most of them did not lead to conviction and punishment. The accused, the police, the prosecutors and even the judges used family honour as an excuse to condone such crimes as crimes of passion,  committed on the spur of the moment by someone incensed by the injury to his or her own honour. This led activists to demand that the state and the courts treat murders in the name of honour as a separate category of crimes in which forgiveness, qisas and diyat did not apply. As a term, \u201chonour killing\u201d thus became a part of everyday language. In March 2015, after multiple failed efforts to reform the law, the Senate, the upper house of the parliament, finally approved a piece of legislation the activists have been asking for all along: honour killing became a crime against the state; the parties to it could not reach an out-of-court settlement in such cases. Women\u2019s murders became \u201cnon-compoundable\u201d \u2014 provided that the prosecution was able to prove that those were honour killings. Tabled by Senator Sughra Imam in 2014, the legislation, however, lapsed because it could not win approval from the National Assembly, the lower house of the parliament, mainly due to opposition from the religious political parties.\n\u201cEvery murder should be seen as a crime against the state, not a matter between two individuals that they can resolve mutually,\u201d\nJahangir believes the focus by activists on the term honour killing has hardly been helpful. Lawyers now spend all their energy and time on proving the crime to be an honour killing, she says. If they can\u2019t do that, she says, the parties to a case can still go and affect a compromise no matter how gruesome the murder.Additionally, qisas and diyat, as Islamic instruments to settle murder disputes, still stay on the statute books. The legal heirs of a victim also have the right to drop the charges at any point during the proceedings. Jahangir blames non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for this state of affairs. \u201cIf they can write in English, they think they can also draft laws,\u201d she says. Their advocacy has only added multiple layers of litigation that women face in courts, she says. Any benefit that could have come about in terms of stricter penalties for honour killing has been apparently cancelled out by these additional legal complexities, Jahangir adds. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA view of the bazaar in Murree | Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nMany in the NGOs seem to recognise these problems. A report commissioned by a group of women\u2019s rights organisations and development foundations in 2015 attributes major hurdles in justice for women to a number of legal and judicial problems. There are hardly any female judges; availability of a lawyer is as low as 2.5 per 100,000 people and there are not enough female police officers, says the report entitled The Laws of Honour Killing and Rape in Pakistan: Current Status and Future Prospects. The report cites surveys conducted by local human rights organisations that reveal a general lack of faith in the judiciary and very low levels of contact with the courts, especially among women. Most importantly, it points out that the reformed laws have changed nothing on the ground. The lack of sympathy encountered by survivors of rape and other forms of violence against women and the tendency among the police officers to encourage out-of-court settlements seem to have survived despite changes in the law, it says. Nafisa Shah, a long-time campaigner for women\u2019s rights and a member of the National Assembly affiliated to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), readily agrees that the criminal justice system needs reforms. In an interview at her residence inside the parliamentary lodges in Islamabad, she argues that the recent cases of women\u2019s murders are far more complex than they are made out to be. In the past, she explains, the manner of killing women was different. \u201cMost murders were spontaneous acts committed with such weapons as axes or clubs and they usually happened in rural areas,\u201d she says. \u201cNow there seems to be premeditation in these killings.\u201d The existing laws, she says, do not define honour killing in such a way as to cover cold-blooded murders. Shah is soon to publish a book, Honour Unmasked, which contains the results of her own field research on the subject. \n\u201cPatriarchy is violent against women. It is particularly violent against fearless women.\u201d\nShah, as well as Jahangir and Mumtaz, agree that distinguishing one type of crime from the other \u2013 as has been the case with honour killing \u2013 has created more problems than it has solved. Ideally, all three say, all crimes should be treated alike \u2013 investigated, prosecuted and adjudicated in the same manner regardless of the gender, caste, creed, ethnicity and the social status of both the perpetrators and the victims. \u201cEvery murder should be seen as a crime against the state, not a matter between two individuals that they can resolve mutually,\u201d says Mumtaz. Fauzia Azeem was a small-town girl from Punjab\u2019s southern backwaters of district Dera Ghazi Khan. Her father, Muhammad Azeem, was a tenant farmer in his native village of Shah Saddar Deen on the Indus Highway. Fauzia was married off at an early age \u2014 she later said she was less than eighteen at the time. She got a divorce after giving birth to a son. Next, she worked as a salesgirl and as a bus hostess in Multan. In 2013, she made her first media appearance, as a contestant for Pakistan Idol, a music show aired on television \u2014 not as Fauzia Azeem but as Qandeel Baloch. She was rejected in the auditions. She then chose social media platforms to post videos that, her critics said, were bold to the extent of being provocative by Pakistani standards. She dallied online with sports stars, politicians and, finally, with a mullah. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIllustration by Samya Arif\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nQandeel Baloch developed a mass fan following. Her videos were liked and shared by over 700,000 followers on Facebook and by more than 40,000 people on Twitter. One the night of July 15, 2016, her younger brother, Waseem, and cousin, Haq Nawaz, killed her (exact details of her murder are yet to be fully known). Their reason in a confessional statement: she was bringing dishonour to the family. In the First Information Report her father registered with the police in Multan -- where she was found murdered in her rented house -- he gave multiple motives: \u201cWaseem \u2026 used to stop Fauzia from working in showbiz \u2026 my son Waseem has killed my daughter Qandeel Baloch in the name of honour \u2026 he has done this for money\u2026Waseem has killed Qandeel Baloch on the instigation of my other son Muhammad Aslam Shaheen who is a subedar in the army.\u201d A week after her murder, The Second Floor (T2F), a meeting place for discussions on political, social and cultural issues, organised a panel discussion. Titled Bold Women, Bad Women: How to talk about Qandeel Baloch, the discussion moved from looking at her private and public life, her views on sexuality, independence and feminism and public reactions to her online activities, to the issue of violence against women in general and honour killing in particular. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe vehicle in which Ambreen was burnt |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nDr Nosheen Ali, who taught sociology at the New York University recently, said at the discussion that a limiting framework of morality divided women into good and bad. We need to ask who has created this divide, she said. \u201cHow is it enforced and who does this benefit?\u201d These questions, she said, take us from \u201ca framework of morality to a framework of patriarchy.\u201d She, then, observed: \u201cPatriarchy is violent against women. It is particularly violent against fearless women.\u201dAbira Ashfaq, a Karachi-based lawyer and another panelist at the discussion, agreed with Nosheen Ali but she added that all murders should be treated just like honour killings are so that people who are killed in the name of ideology or religion also get the justice they deserve. She gave the example of the murder of Zafar Loond, a leftist Seraiki activist living and working in Kot Addu town, less than 100 kilometres from where Qandeel Baloch was killed.He was shot dead outside his house only a day before her murder. It is not clear who killed him. What is known is that, fearing opposition from religious activists, his family did not bury him in his ancestral town of Shadan Loond, which, like Qandeel Baloch\u2019s ancestral village, is also in district Dera Ghazi Khan. There were allegations that he was an Ahmadi.   Loond\u2019s funeral prayers were offered in Dera Ghazi Khan city where he was buried in an unmarked grave.\nAn earlier version of this article was published in the Herald's August 2016 issue.

We are all shocked.\u201d Ida Sharapova, another employee at the radio station, said the suspect grabbed Felgengauer before he stabbed her.\n\u201cAt first I thought he knew her,\u201d she told reporters.The Investigative Committee, which probes serious crimes, said it has opened a criminal case against a 48-year-old man on suspicion of attempted murder.Citing preliminary information, Moscow police said the attacker was driven by \u201cpersonal animosity\u201d and that he was a \u201ccitizen of a foreign country.\u201d Waiting for operation\nVenediktov said he was told \u201cthere was no threat to life but she is in a serious condition,\u201d adding that Felgengauer had been able to get out of the building on her own two feet.\u201cWe are waiting to find out what will happen after an operation,\u201d he added.He also said that two more people had been hurt: the security guard downstairs who had the substance thrown at his face and another guard upstairs who was able to pin the attacker down.Radio station employee Vitaly Ruvinsky posted on Twitter a photo of the dishevelled man dressed in a black jacket and trousers seated in a chair. Police officer Yury Titov said the suspect tried to hide in the building after he stabbed the journalist but was found by the security guards.Venediktov said the man had a drawing of the office plan. \u201cHe had a plan of the office with names of rooms in English, I saw it with my own eyes,\u201d he added.Guard Aleksandr Usachyov, who had overpowered the man, also said the man appeared to be targeting Felgengauer. \u201cI grabbed his knife and pinned him to the floor,\u201d he said.Attacks on journalists\nFelgengauer is one of the radio station's deputy editors and a longtime presenter of a morning news programme. She is also actively involved in opposition rallies and has thousands of followers on her public Facebook page.The Echo of Moscow radio has been the mouthpiece of the country's liberal opposition since the Soviet era, with its editorial policy frequently putting it on political thin ice.The media outlet was founded during the perestroika era as the Soviet Union's first independent radio, going on air for the first time on August 22, 1990.Since then the Echo of Moscow has come a long way, becoming one of the top-cited media in Russia and by far the most popular talk radio station, with broadcasting in many of the country's regions.It is majority owned by Gazprom Media, the media arm of Russian natural gas giant Gazprom.Russia has a disturbing record of attacks on journalists, with 58 killed since 1992, according to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Threats made against journalists often go unaddressed and attacks are not investigated.Another Echo of Moscow presenter Yulia Latynina this year left Russia after a series of attacks on her car and home.\n", "title": "Russian journalist in 'serious condition' after knife attack", "author": "AFP"}, "1281138": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "BEIRUT: One of the militant Islamic State (IS) group's top leaders, Abu Mohammed al-Adnani, described by the US as the \u201cprincipal architect\u201d of the group's attacks on the West, has been killed in Syria, IS announced.The United States (US) said coalition forces had carried out an air strike targeting Adnani in Syria's Aleppo province on Tuesday and that it was still assessing the results of the raid, but that his death would be a major blow to the group.IS news agency Amaq said Adnani was killed \"while surveying operations to repel the military campaigns against Aleppo\" and pledged to avenge his death.In Washington, Pentagon spokesman Peter Cook said Adnani \"has served as principal architect of ISIL's external operations and as ISIL's chief spokesman,\" using another name for the group.\"He has coordinated the movement of ISIL fighters, directly encouraged lone-wolf attacks on civilians and members of the military and actively recruited new ISIL members,\" he said.Adnani, who had a $5 million US bounty on his head, was originally from the western Syrian province of Idlib and joined the militant movement in Iraq, where he served under late Al Qaeda leader Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.Aymenn Jawad Tamimi, an expert on jihadist groups, said his death was \"significant symbolically and in pointing to the wider decline of IS\".A US defence official described him as one of IS's most senior leaders and far more significant than simply being the group's spokesman.\"Most notably, he served as ISIL's chief of external operations, directing and inspiring major terrorist attacks outside of Iraq and Syria,\" he said, linking Adnani to a string of high-profile attacks that have killed hundreds.\"If confirmed, this is a very significant blow for ISIL, and will degrade its ability to direct and inspire terror attacks on the West,\" said the official who declined to be named.\n", "title": "IS claims top leader killed in coalition airstrike", "author": "AFP"}, "1363175": {"date": "Updated Oct 12, 2017 04:30pm", "article": "I love walking back home in Thamel, Nepal when the neighbourhood is shutting down, sleepy eyed, ready to rest.  Scattered music from a few bars reminds the passersby they can still while away the night; shopkeepers yell tired invitations: \u201cLook, shawls from Kashmir\u2026\u201d Outside the guesthouse where I am staying, three boys sit drenched on the sidewalk. Ram is in a white banyan and dhoti, the other two shirtless. They work all day, moving guests in and out, substituting as cooks, cleaners and waiters. \u201cWhy are you going inside?\u201d Ram yells to me. \u201cSit here a bit. It\u2019s a wonderful night.\u201dThe rain is heavier now, the sky flickering purple like a broken TV, but no static of lightning. The orange end of Ram\u2019s joint and the blinking signboard of the guest house are the only witnesses to our presence. \u201cSit here a bit,\u201d Ram insists. \u201cIt\u2019s a wonderful night.\u201d Until now, our interactions have been limited to daylight greetings. In the night\u2019s cover I feel free of judgement; I drop my bag and join him. \u201cWhere do you go every day?\u201d Ram asks me. I tell him about my day, then he tells me about theirs. He passes the joint to the lankier boy \u2013 his cousin, who then passes it to me. We sit in silence, watching the speeding rain; a drop hits my nose, then shoulder, and then that crevice where the skin joins two fingers; I marvel at how the joint remains dry. It is incredible to me how I don\u2019t know anyone in Kathmandu, but some kind of company always makes itself available, whether I put in the effort or not. The kind of company I can join casually or decide to leave without any complaints. I ask Ram to please wake me up at 8am\u2014which means, to promptly show up and bang at my door. This time he will forget because we will end the night smoking up together, too high to wake up in time. \n\nIllustrations by Marium Ali\n\n\nBy the end of my days in Kathmandu, my hands would reach unthinkingly inside my bag, pull out a cigarette and fire it on my lips in one swift movement. I had graduated from bumming cigarettes off friends to carrying my own packs. The habit had set.But back in Karachi, my instinctive muscle-movement had fled. Instead, each time I wanted to smoke outside, I\u2019d fiddle inside my bag hesitating, and the sea of faces surrounding me would rise to map themselves along my space according to perceived levels of threat \u2013 I felt like an animal navigating hostile territory. Each time I lit a cigarette, the streets also lit with paranoia. First, I decided to smoke only in public spaces that were distant from the roar of traffic, well-hidden from the throng of the street. Like tree-shades in parks and khokhas sheltered by concrete pillars. I wanted the air but I could not be seen beneath it. It was never strangers I feared, but relatives, some informant who might report my 'immoral' habits to my parents. Much of my family lived close to my loitering zone, and I did not want to think what would happen if they found me. My fear, like most others, was out of proportion. The relative who chanced upon my 'fallen' behaviour had the courtesy to call me up before my mother \u2013 so I had a heads-up \u2013 and my mother\u2019s own reaction was more an outrage rooted in concern than disappointment. Meanwhile my relative to this date teeters on that thin line between scolding and moralising.With the worst over, I rationalise that all the stress I\u2019ve been hoarding trying to smoke outside but in secret, is not worth it. The constant fear of being found ruins the very undertaking: I go out with the intention of calming myself with a walk and a smoke, but my edginess drags all pleasure out. Now that I know my family will only admonish me so much, I might as well start puffing at whim. Step two: I will smoke in open spaces. \n\nBy Syed Asif\n\n\nOnce at a dhaba, standing against a wall, not even in the main seating area where I am part of the activity; another time, on a sidewalk, a book in my other hand I have been reading for over half an hour; a third time outside a bus stop outside Islamabad; the same interjection, a different male voice: \u201cYou should not be smoking.\u201d Always an older, often fatherly man. Straight from the throng, a determined passerby who knows nothing about me interrupts his synchronised strides to inform me of my very serious transgression: I am a girl and I am smoking. He isn\u2019t concerned for my lungs. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look good, a respectable girl like you smoking.\u201d What has health got to do with anything? It is my image he is worried about and is adamant to protect. To illustrate his good intentions, he gestures towards the people watching us, a swish of his palm, this world I must tend to; the other customers at the dhaba, travellers waiting for the Daweoo. \u201cDo you see how everyone is looking at you?\u201dLike I have a shield pulled up around my body that keeps me from registering judgmental jeers and hostile eyes.\n\u201cI had no idea I\u2019ve been getting looks for almost forty five minutes now.\u201d My defense in these situations is sarcasm. Now Uncle is offended. \u201cI\u2019m just watching out for you. I don\u2019t think like these people. But I know how dirty their minds are.\u201d \u201cWhy don\u2019t you mind your own business.\u201d My mood is soured. Uncle-encounters always leave me thinking, maybe the stress isn\u2019t worth it. Of course I could just smoke inside, what\u2019s the big deal. But what\u2019s wrong with wanting this silly indulgence, as harmful as it to my lungs? I try to think about the other people on the street; the ones who don\u2019t bother reacting. Like the man reading a newspaper by the chai-station. He kept me from crushing my cigarette during Uncle\u2019s investigation. When I came he had paused briefly; he threw a curious glance my way but then promptly returned to his tea and paper. He did not feel the need to come up to me and express the deep personal offense he felt; he did not look my way again. \n\n\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s in your bag?\u201d But she does not wait for an answer. The bag is thrust off my shoulder and into the inspecting hands of a policewoman stationed at the entrance of the Lahore Railway Station. She pulls two packs of Marlboro Lights out, and her companion chirps: \u201cCigarettes.\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t you know it\u2019s illegal for women to smoke?\u201d \n\u201cWhere does it say that?\u201d \n\u201cDon\u2019t be smart with us. It\u2019s not allowed.\u201d \n\u201cAnyway we are not planning to smoke. We just came to buy tickets.\u201d \n\u201cTake these two in for a body search.\u201d Almost an hour later, my friend and I are shaken, bruised, and humiliated by the policewomen\u2019s behaviour. After dragging us inside the 'searching' booth, they assaulted us, took away our phones and passports, and forced us to pose for photos in our tank tops. They took away our money and the bottles of lotion and oil they found in our bags. We were slapped every time we told them we were not, in fact, sex workers, and slapped harder when we asked what sex work has to do with buying tickets. The policewomen\u2019s logic, as they explained it: They had significant evidence that we indulged in 'immoral' activities. The contents of our bags, the hickey on my friend\u2019s neck, the clothes we were wearing. Women like us \u2013 they altered accusation with blow \u2013 were responsible for 'dishonouring' our families\u2019 names, for 'corrupting' this Islamic Republic\u2019s streets, for the very 'moral decline' of our gender. Women like us, who came to 'seduce' men and 'corrupt' young boys, deserved to be punished and beaten.  Each time my friends hear the story later, they try to piece together a missing link. \u201cBut what did you do wrong?\u201d \n\u201cThere must have been something that gave them cause to suspect you so confidently.\u201d \n\u201cHow can things take such a drastic turn from a simple pack of cigarettes?\u201d \n\n\n\nThe railway station nightmare somehow sapped most of the fear out of me. If women can do that to each other\u2014well, why even be surprised by men anymore. Where I once used to seek shadowy street corners to smoke, I now start brandishing my rolled creations everywhere. And when men interrupt my solo dhaba time, whether to comment on my cigarette choice or my mere existence, I am not shaken. Depending on my level of bitterness and indifference, I respond with one of the following ripostes: I had no idea my lungs were made of a different material. \nWhen was the last time you interrupted a man like this? \nIf I ever find you smoking it will be your last day. Uncles are more difficult. This one is taking a different but familiar trajectory\u2014before anything else he wants to know whether I am a boy or a girl. Upon confirming his suspicions, that the creature before him (who until his arrival was pleasantly absorbed in her book and cup of tea) is indeed a woman, he now demands: \u201cAre you single or married? Does your father know you smoke?\u201dUncle\u2019s shadow looms and he is in no hurry to leave. He\u2019s annoying but I\u2019m also better prepared: I have learned that Karachi streets require a certain labour from feminine bodies, we have to sponge our comfort out of the air, we have to drain and wring safety out of the very breath of public spaces. A mixture of creativity and deception has never let me down: \u201cOf course my father knows. We smoke together.\u201dWide-eyed shock. There\u2019s nothing he can say to that. Next time I\u2019ll tell him our whole family smokes. Uncle retreats; with him, the tiny ball of fear I had been holding on to also rolls away. Now I can return to my reading. I light another cigarette, ask the dhaba wala for a maachis. I have begun to believe that my decision to smoke is part of my fundamental desire to roam as and how I want. In my head, the more people see women smoking or indulging in small pleasures outside, the less they will stop assigning moral values to our decisions. And the more they will leave us alone.  \n\n\n\nThat is not the case online. I am repeatedly surprised by the outrage that rains down on social media each time a woman poses with a cigarette. Several friends of mine have been guilty of this crime. Putting up photographs with their lips on fire. Only witches play with fire, and we are hunted like witches too. The pits of self-righteous hell can be found in these comment threads, under these photos.They come in droves: Comments, diatribes, entire essays by men and women alike, scolding the girl they do not know, for her wrongs, admonishing her for tainting the name of feminism. At dhabas and on the streets, only a few devils have the courage to actually come up to a smoking girl and say something; most leave their condemnations to their gaze. In online spaces the opposite is true: Most feel the need to comment, hiding behind their profile photos. Some are provoked by the photograph; they take it as a personal affront or as a projected sexual invitation. Others outright reject the smoker: \u201cThis is not what a feminist looks like! Is this what our fights have come to?\u201d Then there are those who insist their shock is not rooted in any impulse to preach; they just want girls to think about their families and how their choices might affect their mothers. But all agree that harming one\u2019s body is not progressive; feminism should not be mixed with nicotine. Except that damaging one\u2019s lungs has never been a feminist aim. Only the right to make a choice has \u2013 and if that choice is harmful to one\u2019s own body, what right has anyone else to comment?These intrusions are rooted in a social need to control feminine bodies \u2013 controlling our sexualities extends into controlling our physical movements, our attire, and now, what our bodies consume. To me there is little difference between a culture that considers it a personal affront if I get an abortion, and a culture that is shocked by my choice to smoke. In both cases it is my agency that is curtailed.Whoever sustains a vice does so in full knowledge of its consequences. I know I am harming my lungs. I know that men gape at me when I smoke outside. They gape at me even if I do nothing. But when I continue to smoke I am simply exercising my agency for a simple break; I am not interested in adding smoking to the list of global feminist goals.Trolls and well-meaning citizens on the interwebs miss this point and instead, interpret a personal choice as a collective aim. This is because they are not thinking about the cigarettes at all, they are thinking about the woman. The shape of her body distorts whatever else they see; the shape of her body does not fit with indulgence; the shape of the body allows her to be commented upon. The shape of her body does not belong to her; it would be a wonder if her lungs did. \n\n\n\nOnce I sat down with a male friend to dig deeper into this thoroughly male anxiety. What does it matter, really? Why must my choice to smoke a cigarette under the open sky or in a public space be such an affront to so many?\u201cBecause you are a girl.\u201d My friend is soon exasperated. He says it isn\u2019t about any logical reasoning really, it\u2019s just one of those things that society has ordained. \u201cSure men already smoke, but don\u2019t women have better things to demand rights for? And think of the impact it will have on her children\u2014at the end of the day it is immoral.\u201d He\u2019s rambling, growing angrier with each counter-question I pose. A few joints into our conversation the gems tumble out: \u201cWell, all your feminism and all is good, but think about it. Today women want the right to smoke, tomorrow they will want to be running in miniskirts down the road!\u201dI can\u2019t help laugh. Aside from my friend\u2019s obvious hypocrisy, there\u2019s this confirmed fact: We live in a strange world. In this world women\u2019s lungs are somehow weaker than men\u2019s. In this world nothing a woman does can be dissociated from its moral implications, even where there are none. In this world, men honestly think that the feminist revolution will begin with a cigarette and end up with women running naked on the streets.\nDisclaimer: Cigarette smoking is injurious to health.\nAre you a discriminated against due to your gender, ethnicity or religion?

And despite my recent lament about the shoddy way too many theaters seem content to display the movies they\u2019re showing to an extent that were it not for professional obligations, I would avoid theaters entirely, I still believe in the theatrical experience.Even in these dark days, the theatrical experience can still be revelatory. Christopher Nolan\u2019s Dunkirk, for instance, was a movie made to be seen in cinemas \u2014 its crystal clear images blown up to the biggest size possible, its bone-rattling bombing runs inspiring involuntary flinches of terror. Blade Runner 2049 is another example of a movie that needs to be seen on the biggest screen possible where its stunning vistas and complicated sound design can be seen and heard most effectively.But making sure that experience is good for everyone can be tricky. Warner Bros domestic distribution president Jeff Goldstein emphasised that when I asked him about the challenges involved with showing Dunkirk, a film distributed in six different projection formats, including actual celluloid in 70mm, which is relatively rare but allows the filmmaker to capture more detail in each frame.\u201cSo, the population of film projectors is really low. Most of those projectors have been taken out of theaters and replaced with digital equipment, either 2K, 4K or better equipment. The niche locations that have film are few and far between. So what was interesting, just from an operational point of view, was to figure out how to do this,\u201d Goldstein said. Theatre operators, perhaps recognising the opportunity Dunkirk presented to get casual filmgoers back in theaters, stepped up to the challenge.\nGoing to the movies ought to be special \u2014 here\u2019s how theatres can make that happen\n\u201cI have to say that exhibition embraced Chris and Warner Brothers in a really proactive and special way and said, \u2018OK, tell us how to do it. We don\u2019t have projectionists anymore .... In many cases, we don\u2019t have equipment or if we have equipment ... we don\u2019t know how to operate it and, quite frankly, it needs maintenance,\u2019\u201d Goldstein said. \u201cIt\u2019s all sorts of different issues that were involved, and we figured out logistically and operationally how you get in there and bring all the equipment up to speed, and then how do you operate it. So we provided projectionists in a lot of locations. We help train projectionists, and we used outside vendors who specialise in this very narrow field.\u201dGoldstein repeatedly highlighted the importance to Warner Bros of showing Dunkirk in the way that best shows off Nolan\u2019s vision as a filmmaker \u2014 a key concern for studios who remain committed to theatrical distribution even as streaming increases in prominence. Consider the case of Amazon, a studio that, in theory, has the infrastructure and the customer base in place to skip theaters entirely and stream straight to homes. Contrary to Netflix \u2014 whose executives openly sneer at theatrical exhibition \u2014 Amazon has stepped up their distribution efforts. This has a great deal of appeal to the people behind the cameras.\u201cFilmmakers want to go where they feel their work is respected and where a company has the resources to deliver on their vision,\u201d Christine Vachon, the founder of Killer Films, told Variety when the industry mag covered Amazon\u2019s increased efforts at distribution. \u201cAmazon is delivering on all counts.\u201dBut getting movies into theatres is only half the battle: you have to make the experience worthwhile for audiences. As Goldstein put it, \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to advertise a show time and have a patron go to a theatre \u2014 you want to make sure that they\u2019re seeing the perfect version every single time that movie\u2019s shown.\u201dEnter the team at IMAX, which has emerged as the gold standard in exhibition over the past decade or two. I\u2019ll admit to having been skeptical about IMAX\u2019s push into multiplexes \u2014 in large part because the screens are smaller than those we grew used to at museums \u2014 but over the past few years, IMAX has been the only format in which I\u2019ve yet to have a bad experience. In addition to properly training theatre workers and ensuring that the air quality in a screening room does not degrade the equipment, IMAX focuses on important-yet-oft-ignored technical matters such as bulb brightness.If something goes wrong at a theater, IMAX employees can fix it almost immediately because the company literally has a command center that monitors the quality of projection in real time.\u201cAll of our systems are connected to our INOC \u2014 our IMAX Network Operations Centre \u2014 and they\u2019re wired to that centre through the Internet,\u201d said Colin Smyth, IMAX\u2019s senior vice president of global theatre services. \u201cSo for example, if a system calibration failed in a theatre in China ... we would take action on that. And we would contact the theatre and perhaps remotely log in to find out why it failed and what we need to do to make sure that the system is being properly calibrated and that projectors are in alignment and the light output is, you know, right [and] it meets the standard and so on.\u201dThe goal is to ensure that every audience member enjoys the same experience no matter where in the world he or she is \u2014 a matter of some importance to the filmmakers who have come to rely on the IMAX brand.\u201cWhen you look at a filmmaker like Christopher Nolan \u2014 I think I can, I don\u2019t want to put words in his mouth \u2014 but you know we can guarantee filmmakers of that calibre, like J.J. Abrams, your Zack Snyders, they\u2019re not creating movies for you to watch them on a mobile phone or even a laptop. They are, we like to say, they dream in IMAX. They want to see their vision come to life in the biggest way possible,\u201d an IMAX spokesperson said.It is, perhaps, unrealistic to expect every single movie screen in America to be monitored in real time 24/7/365, as IMAX does. But if you want audiences to share the dream in a theatre, as the original dreamer intended, then ensuring the highest-quality theatrical experience possible needs to be a bigger priority for everyone in the movie industry.\u2014 By arrangement with The Washington PostPublished in Dawn, ICON, October 22nd, 2017\n", "title": "WIDE ANGLE: A WORTHWHILE EXPERIENCE", "author": "Sonny Bunch"}, "1366372": {"date": "October 29, 2017", "article": "\n\n\n\nWith the 2018 elections not too far away, a host of new political parties are being launched across Cliftonia.

The decision-making on these issues had been held up at forums led by former prime minister Nawaz Sharif and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar pending detailed institutional consultative process or politico-economic concerns. Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi is making sure these matters are settled fast.In recent weeks, Prime Minister Abbasi, while presiding over a meeting of the federal cabinet, decided to empower oil marketing companies (OMCs) to independently set the price of high-speed diesel (HSD) without an updated market study. Simultaneously, the commission for dealers and marketing companies on the sale of petrol was also increased by about 33 paisa per litre.On the other hand, he reversed the deregulation of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) after almost two decades through the federal cabinet even though it should have gone to the Council of Common Interests (CCI). The initiatives for gas sector reforms were also taken on a fast-track basis, along with changes in the exploration and production mechanism of the oil and gas sector, but have so far been stalled following serious question marks raised by the provinces over the intention, manner and expected outcome of the process.\nThe subject was taken up in a curious manner. The summary was moved in a rush without the advance mandatory circulation and the decision was not officially announced\nHSD has a predominate share in Pakistan\u2019s petroleum consumption, used mostly in transport, agriculture and power generation, and is a major source of revenue to the government with growing consumption patterns. The decision on the HSD price deregulation was allowed despite a study conducted by the Pakistan Institute of Development Economics (PIDE) \u2014 a public-sector institution \u2014 concluded two years ago that Pakistan\u2019s market was not fit for deregulation of two key petroleum products: HSD and petrol. Interestingly, the Planning Commission, Oil and Gas Regulatory Authority (Ogra) and Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) also opposed the move to give up the government\u2019s powers to fix HSD pricing.The prime minister overruled the opposition and ordered a three-month try to the new arrangement with a review at the end. He went on to add that the deregulation of petrol pricing would be next.The Ogra\u2019s role was contained to the extent that it would develop a mechanism to monitor the OMCs commercial stock position and the dealers\u2019 inventory system, knowing well the fact that Ogra\u2019s total human resources was no more than 200 staff and it lacked the technical capability to judge product quality.The Planning Commission and Ogra disagreed with the petroleum division\u2019s argument that the deregulation of diesel prices will lead to increased investment and creation of additional storage capacity. They believed the same argument for the partial deregulation of the oil sector involving healthy incentives of \u2018deemed duty\u2019 was misused in 2000 for minting billions of rupees in additional profits instead of increasing storage capacity and infrastructure.The PIDE had concluded that the argument that deregulation would unleash competitive forces in the petroleum industry could be negated as three main OMCs held more than 80 per cent of the market share, with PSO alone occupying more than 50pc.An indicator of market concentration \u2014 the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) \u2014 for Pakistan\u2019s petroleum industry was close to 0.35, which showed a high level of concentration in the industry. High concentration in any market implies greater chances of non-competitive behaviour and cartelisation, leading to inefficiency, among other things.On the other hand, the federal cabinet went ahead with reversing the deregulation of LPG prices even though it was expanding the sector through LPG air mix plants across the country. The federal cabinet appointed a price advisory committee comprising managing directors of all the public sector LPG producers amid criticism by LPG dealers and marketing companies. They saw LPG producers as the key reason behind high domestic prices.This would create a unique regulatory environment where the advice of the regulated entities (licencees) would be binding on the regulator. The manner in which the subject was taken up was also very curious. The summary was moved in a rush without advance mandatory circulation to the stakeholders and the decision was not officially announced. \u201cDue to paucity of time, the summary could not be circulated to the concerned ministries/organisations,\u201d the summary to the cabinet said, adding that \u201cLPG prices will be revised by the Ministry of Energy (petroleum division) from time to time based on recommendations of the LPG pricing committee\u201d and will be notified by Ogra. Ogra warned that without a private sector industry representative, the price committee would attract suspicion of conflict of interest and hamper efficient regulation.The regulator put on record that the government could issue policy guidelines under section 21 of the Ogra law only after cabinet approval but any guidelines issued by the price committee \u201cshall be inconsistent with the law\u201d.

With the dry weather looming in wake of La-Nina pattern, there is no prediction for rain until mid-November. But the dropping temperature will gradually enhance the foggy conditions across the country. The mercury level has already decreased to 11 \u00b0C and as a result the Met Office warned of mist and shallow fog on GT Road from Islamabad to Kharian on Sunday morning. A moderate fog would be witnessed almost all over Punjab from Gujaranwala to Bahawalpur in coming days. Fog forms when warm air meets colder air and the water vapour in the air is cooled to become dense liquid like droplets in the air. However, a dense fog is created in the central and southern Punjab along with northern Sindh in the winter due to the presence of large water bodies, including rivers, lakes and ponds in these areas. Due to the same reason, there is no fog on the motorway from Peshawar to the boundary of the Salt Range with central Punjab. At the same time, the Met Office predicted a dry and cool weather up to mid-November while two brief rainy spells are expected in the middle of the month. However, soon after that rainfall, foggy conditions will prevail across Punjab with heavy fog in the plains due to the added moisture in the air and on the land surface. \u201cCold, dry and foggy conditions will prevail in November as rains have been suspended due to La-Nina conditions,\u201d said an official of the Met Office. \u201cThese conditions also add to nasal allergies, respiratory problems as well as dryness of the skin.\u201d The La Nina pattern develops in the winter and is the opposite of Al-Nino pattern which develops in the summer. Both these patterns occur due to abnormal temperature variations in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Peru, South America. During La Nina, the sea surface temperature of eastern Pacific Ocean becomes lower than normal which triggers a global pattern and in South Asia the rain bearing clouds coming from Europe move towards the north. Instead of coming to Afghanistan, Pakistan and India, the clouds travel towards southern Siberia and the Chinese side of the Himalayas.

Federal Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordina\u00adtion Mian Riaz Hussain Pirzada told reporters at the National Press Club in Islamabad on Thursday that Shahbaz Sharif should lead the party \u2014 apparently since Nawaz Sharif was facing trial in corruption cases. Editorial: Nawaz or Shahbaz?Differences between the two brothers and their heirs apparent \u2014 Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shahbaz \u2014 became public knowledge when Hamza chose to air his concerns before media after he and his father failed to dissuade the elder Sharif and his daughter from adopting a policy of confrontation with institutions, particularly after the Supreme Court announced its verdict in the Panama Papers case ousting Nawaz Sharif from office. Now it appears that Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has been cementing his position for an impending behind-the-scenes battle aimed at taking up the reins of the party, as he met long-time friend former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Friday to discuss party affairs with him. And one of the Punjab cabinet members, Raja Ashfaq Sarwar, conceded that the party lacked a clear direction and most of its members \u201care confused\u201d. The meeting between Chaudhry Nisar and Shahbaz Sharif was being seen as of great importance since both have been on the same page since the Panama Papers controversy emerged. \u201cBoth want Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz to avoid a clash with the army and the judiciary and face accountability without much complaint,\u201d a PML-N leader said. A close aide to Nawaz Sharif said that even if the court had restrained the former premier from holding the office of the party president the post might not have been given to Shahbaz Sharif on a platter. \u201cDo not rule out Maryam Nawaz\u2019s chances to don the cap of the party president in such a scenario,\u201d he said, adding that Shahbaz Sharif\u2019s role would remain confined to Punjab even after the next general elections. In a related development on Friday, Railways Minister Saad Rafique telephoned Mr Pirzada and asked him about his proposal to replace Nawaz Sharif with his brother. \u201cI told him [Saad Rafique] that what I had said is in the best interest of the party,\u201d Mr Pirzada said. There were, however, some PML-N politicians who remained unconvinced.Minister of State for Interior Affairs Talal Chaudhry said there could be a difference of opinion in the party but \u201cthere is one leader in the PML-N and he is Nawaz Sharif\u201d. Had anyone asked Shahbaz Sharif if he was interested in becoming the president of the party, he raised the question. \u201cSimilar ideas were floated during the Musharraf regime,\u201d Mr Chaudhry said, adding that after Nawaz Sharif, his brother was the most senior leader in the party and he was always there to rescue the party when such a time came. \u2018Lost\u2019 lawmakers meet\nThe situation has left the party\u2019s parliamentarians worried. They want Nawaz Sharif to give them a \u2018clear road map\u2019 going into 2018 elections and tell them who will lead them in the election campaign. They are having meetings in groups to share their growing concern about the future of the party and its direction. In background interviews, some PML-N legislators said it was the time both brothers (Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif) sat with the party men and told them how they would go into 2018 \u2014 with confrontation mode with the judiciary and the army or the party\u2019s development agenda. Besides, who will lead the party in the election campaign when Nawaz Sharif and his children are facing the graft cases. A few of the PML-N lawmakers endorsed Riaz Pirzada\u2019s criticism of the election of the party head and termed his proposal to replace Nawaz Sharif with his brother a \u2018workable solution\u2019. \u201cAt the moment most of us (parliamentarians) are confused and want Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif to have a sitting with us to give us a clear direction leading to next year\u2019s election,\u201d Punjab Minister for Labour and Human Resource Raja Ashfaq Sarwar told Dawn. Mr Sarwar has recently attended a meeting of a group of over two-dozen MPAs, mostly from south Punjab, in Lahore in which the proposal of either forming a forward bloc to negotiate better terms with the Sharifs ahead of election or backing Shahbaz Sharif as party president was reportedly discussed. Answering a question, Mr Sarwar laughed off at the idea of forward bloc in the PML-N, particularly in Punjab, and clarified that he and some 20 MPAs were invited by MPA Shaukat Lalika at his residence, where they discussed growing unrest in the party because of having no \u2018future\u2019 direction. \u201cSimilarly whenever the party legislators meet these days they discuss the same things,\u201d Mr Sarwar said and added that Nawaz Sharif on his return next week would be requested to give them time and decide the future action plan. \u201cSo far the idea of replacing Mian sahib with Shahbaz Sharif is a non-issue in the party. Nawaz Sharif is important for us and he has vote bank. But the party men want to know how to move forward,\u201d he said. Mr Lalika told Dawn that he had hosted dinner for his uncle, Ashfaq Sarwar, who recently performed Haj. \u201cI also invited about three dozen other party MPAs to the feast. We discussed the party matters and the coming election.\u201d He said the party was united under the Sharif brothers. \u201cWe never demanded or discussed replacement of Mian sahib with Shahbaz Sharif,\u201d he said. Punjab government spokesman Malik Ahmad Khan said: \u201cThere has been consensus in the PML-N that Mian sahib should remain the party president as it is united under his leadership. The whole politics of the party revolves around him. However, it is the advice of the pragmatists to the party president to restrain the hawks to neutralise the \u201cPML-N G.T. Road political discourse and NA-120 by-poll campaign\u2019s strategy of confrontation. There should be no confrontation with institutions\u201d. About the concerns of the party legislators, Mr Ahmad said: \u201cOur party men want elections. Confrontational path may delay elections, they fear. And at the same time if they are not told about who will be candidate for the office of prime minister after the 2018 election, at least they should be told who will lead the election campaign,\u201d he said. Sheikh Rasheed foresees end of \u2018Sharif politics\u2019\nMeanwhile, Awami Muslim League (AML) president Sheikh Rashid Ahmed has predicted that the PML-N is a divided house and its parliamentarians will leave the \u201cPakistan Muslim League led by Nawaz Sharif\u201d in the coming days. \u201cEarlier, I said 40 parliamentarians are ready to leave the party but now I am sure that more than 70 will do so, including Prime Minister [Shahid Khaqan] Abbasi, Chaudhry Nisar and Saad Rafique,\u201d the AML chief claimed at a public meeting outside his residence Lal Haveli in Rawalpindi.

The petition cited secretary defence, chief of air staff, deputy chief of air staff and Air Intelligence director general as respondents. The petitioner Tanzeela Khan requested the IHC to form a joint investigation team (JIT) to investigate how her husband, Group Captain Rizwan Attique, died in August this year.

As time passed and I lost my sense of wonder, my feet also began to drag along for boring, predictable walks to the town centre where I had nowhere to go in particular. My steps adjusted to their new, relaxed stroll more in tune with the slow pace of my new home. Then, a couple of years later, like other new mothers I began pushing my stroller every morning, along the same cobbled lanes, chasing the fading sunshine to warm a little one, on those very short, winter days. The social pressure for a baby\u2019s obligatory daily voyage into the outdoors \u2014 catching the air and light \u2014 was new to me, and frankly, a bit inconvenient. I remember growing up mainly indoors. It was either the heat, the poor security situation, pollution, the lack of walkable roads or simply a combination of all that kept us kids (especially girls) locked into our houses in Karachi. I now live in a small town in northern Italy, less than 15 kilometres from central Milan, but in every other way, far removed from it. It\u2019s not a place for the young and restless. Those who want more from life graduate from high school looking forward to their next big step \u2014 getting out of here. What remains is a mix of those who will inherit local businesses, marry their childhood sweetheart and rely on an army of grandparents to mind the kids, or those who, like the town itself, find comfort in their known, unchanging reality. \nAs Italy grapples with an influx of migrants, people of a small town in the Lombardi region wonder what\u2019s going on\nMy town thrives on convention and predictability. On a walk around the neighbourhood, well dressed and stylish Italians will be able to point out the school their grandmother attended, and the butcher she used that the family continues to go to. They know their neighbours since childhood and are likely to have married lovers who grew up in an adjoining street. Most families vacation in the same summer beach town and cruise down the same ski slopes every year. There is great comfort in knowing that everything will continue to fall into its own slot without any surprises and an entire year\u2019s planning is done an entire year in advance.Imagine the nervousness then when things around my townspeople began to change. Just within the last couple of years, two Chinese tailoring shops have opened up on my walk leading to the unchangeable town centre. In the centre itself, dark skinned, poorly dressed men and some women stand at street corners begging for money or selling children\u2019s books or toys to passersby. They are more likely to be from Nigeria, Gambia, Ethiopia \u2014 migrants who have made it to Italy\u2019s shore in extreme desperation. In the evenings, Pakistani and Bengali flower-sellers go from restaurant to restaurant \u2014 surprisingly they are free to enter and disturb the clients;  imagine beggars walking into a restaurant in Karachi \u2014 interrupting the Italian dining experience. Hijab-clad women are now seen shopping at the local weekly fruit market, and groups of Middle-Eastern men stand suspiciously in corners, speaking in unknown tongues that invoke fear and danger. Towns people think they are most probably selling drugs. \n\nThe city centre reflects the rapid multicultural change across the region| photos by the writer\n\n\nThe people of my town are left wondering: \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201dThis was also the caption on a photograph that appeared on one of my town\u2019s group pages on Facebook. Usually, people share pictures of lost dogs, stolen bicycles and beautiful sunsets, but here was a poorly-taken photograph of a group of young men sitting on a ledge outside the main train station. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on?\u201d the post said. All the men in the photograph were African, poorly dressed, looking weak and exhausted, and perhaps to some, a threat. The comments were vitriolic. People ranted about the face of their town changing, and their sisters feeling unsafe walking back from the station in the evenings. They recounted their own interactions with \u201csuch people\u201d \u2014 one held a knife to an old lady\u2019s neck for money, another yelled out profanities to a passing Italian driver. Words like \u201cuncultured\u201d and \u201caggressive\u201d were used repeatedly. \n\nMany asylum seekers get housing and food but have nothing else to do all day\n\n\nSurely, this change is making many people uneasy. The influx of migrants is common discussion at gatherings, dinner tables, and even amongst mommies at playgroups. There is usually concern, bordering on political correctness, which readily turns into anger when the same people begin posting comments on social media. There is no doubt that the situation is complicated and it has changed many people. My town, the last bastion of left politics in the Lombardy region, recently elected an anti-immigrant centre-right mayor to replace the centre-left local government. The political discourse by the right throughout the mayoral campaign was about \u201csecurity\u201d, \u201cour families first\u201d, \u201cghettoisation\u201d and halting the inflow of migrants into the town. One acquaintance has declared himself a \u201cracist, from now on\u201d on public fora because of how he now feels about black people. Another acquaintance views the hijab-clad women now seen regularly at the fruit market to be challenging the culture of the city. A friend mocked that the best way of getting a job and a house in Italy now is to swim up the shore of Sicily and pretend to be an asylum seeker. The state even gives you money for three cigarettes a day, she said. And she is herself a migrant to Italy. \n\nA sunny autumn day in a north Italian town\n\n\nI\u2019m worried about where this will lead because the tension is rising in all of Italy. In this year alone, over 95,000 people have arrived in the country by sea. These are people without jobs, without money, without many skills and in a country that has still not recovered from the economic crisis, is culturally insular and where the state is reaching levels of exasperation on how to deal with the growing number of arrivals. The migrants are desperate and either live in state-sponsored temporary housing, or lie homeless on the streets, near train stations, begging for money and dignity. They have introduced a whole new reality to small Italian towns and the sheer number is testing the country\u2019s economic and cultural foundations. \nI\u2019m worried about where this will lead because the tension is rising in all of Italy.

I see despondent, defeated and exhausted faces of migrants who steal short naps under trees or on public benches and then abruptly get up and go back to selling books or toys to parents of happy children playing in the piazzas. They don\u2019t belong to this town and to its sounds of laughter and joy.All those five years ago, I landed at the Milan airport on a one-way ticket from Karachi, flying direct with PIA. The crew told me that every few years, the Italian government offers to \u2018legalise\u2019 those who are in the country without the proper paperwork. When that process took place, PIA had to increase its number of flights for some time because people were finally able to go back home with a visa allowing return to Italy. At the time, I knew only one Pakistani already living in the town I would then call home. He sold flowers by night and helped out with some work as a labourer during the day. On my previous visits, he had shown me pictures of his four children who he left behind with his wife in Rawalpindi. He hadn\u2019t been back in five years. He was one of many young Pakistani men I have found in various countries who walk around with photographs of their children in their pockets \u2014 old pictures with folds on them, perhaps looking nothing like the children do now. \n\n\n\nPIA now flies only once a week, on Fridays. Last Friday it took with it, the charred body of a broken-hearted young Pakistani man. \u2018GF\u2019 was a 33-year-old asylum seeker, living at a shelter  home provided by a local NGO just a few kilometres from me, in another small town of northern Italy. On a mid-September Wednesday afternoon, he stood at a small parking spot on a roadside, between a grocery store and the post office, doused his body with petrol and set himself on fire. Passersby must have stopped and looked in absolute horror. On late afternoons, a nondescript road in small town Italy only ever sees parents walking with their children to a neighbourhood park, or old people sitting on benches watching the same world go by every day, used to a predictable stillness in the air. And in the middle of all this mundaneness, was this incomprehensible display of despondency by a man succumbing to his insufferable pain. And perhaps the only person who could make some sense of this anguish was a 20-year-old Egyptian, himself an asylum seeker, who intervened and threw his jacket onto the burning man, putting out some of the flames.Help arrived, as it does when emotional suffering becomes physically apparent. A helicopter took \u2018GF\u2019 to a hospital in Milan. During the night between Wednesday and Thursday, he passed away, unable perhaps to deal with the pain of the death of his child back in Pakistan, a few months earlier. This was grief compounded by separation from family, and the agony of having covered this difficult journey thus far, only to realise that there\u2019s no way ahead and no way back.The writer is a former television producer now living in ItalyPublished in Dawn, EOS, October 22nd, 2017\n", "title": "MIGRATIONS: THE CHANGING FACE OF EUROPE", "author": "Aliya Salahuddin"}, "1363111": {"date": "Updated October 11, 2017", "article": "The US has flown two supersonic heavy bombers over the Korean peninsula in a show of force against Pyongyang, staging the first night-time joint aviation exercises with Japan and South Korea.Two B-1B Lancers based in Guam flew a mission in the vicinity of the Sea of Japan late Tuesday, the US Pacific Air Forces said in a statement.\u201cFlying and training at night with our allies in a safe, effective manner is an important capability shared between the US, Japan and the Republic of Korea and hones the tactical prowess of each nations' aviators,\u201d Major Patrick Applegate said in a statement.South Korean defence authorities on Wednesday said the bombers staged a simulated air-to-ground missile firing drill with two South Korean fighters over the Sea of Japan (East Sea).The four aircraft then flew across the peninsula and staged another round of a firing exercise over the Yellow Sea before the two B-IBs returned home, the South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) said.\u201cThis drill was part of a routine deployment training aimed at enhancing deterrence\u201d against the North's nuclear threats, the JCS said in a statement.\u201cThrough the practice this time, South Korean and US air forces showed off the allies' resolve for strong retaliation against North Korea's nuclear and missile threats,\u201d it added.The B-1Bs also conducted exercises with Japan's Air Force in what the US statement called a \u201csequenced bilateral mission\u201d.Tensions over North Korea's weapons programme have soared in recent months with Pyongyang launching a flurry of missiles and conducting its sixth and most powerful nuclear test last month.Its actions were in defiance of multiple sets of United Nations sanctions, prompting US President Donald Trump to threaten military action against the regime.The exercises came as a US nuclear-powered fast-attack submarine, the USS Tuckson, made a call in South Korea's southern port of Jinhae, the US Pacific Command said.It did not say when the Hawaii-based submarine with a crew of around 150 would depart the peninsula.The last flight by US bombers was 17 days earlier when four US F-35B stealth fighter jets and two B-1Bs flew over the peninsula.The North's missile and nuclear capabilities have made significant progress under leader Kim Jong-Un, who on Saturday told party officials that the country's atomic weapons were a \u201ctreasured sword\u201d to protect it from aggression.\n", "title": "US bombers fly over Korean peninsula in show of force", "author": "AFP"}, "1365840": {"date": "October 24, 2017", "article": "CLARK: A five-month battle against the militant Islamic State group in the southern Philippines that claimed more than 1,100 lives has ended following a final battle inside a mosque, defence chiefs said on Monday.The conclusion of the conflict ended immediate fears that IS would establish a Southeast Asian base in the southern city of Marawi.

In front of the building a weary woman sits on the ground leaning on her right hand for support, pain etched in every line of her face. All of a sudden, a shout rends the busy morning at Pims. An impassioned cry of: \u201cJeena ho ga, marna ho ga, dharna ho ga, dharna ho ga!\u201d (Life or death, the sit-in will continue.)   The cry for protest has come from a crowd of around 700 paramedics, doctors and support staff, who have been on strike for almost two weeks campaigning for their demand to separate Pims from the Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (SZABMU).Inside the OPD, patients wait in queues \u2014 men in their queue and the women in theirs. But there is no one behind the counter who could tell them where to go for treatment. A few yards away from the OPD, a young man with a fractured leg lies on a stretcher surrounded by anxious attendants awaiting treatment.   The situation inside the Emergency Ward is even more precarious. A few nurses run from one patient to the other trying to keep up with the number of patients they have to treat.  The patients will have to wait till 11am before they can be treated. For the last two weeks, the protesters gather in front of the administration department at Pims early in the morning and register their protest before getting back to work at 11am.Pims was merged with SZAMBU in 2013 when the university was established through a law passed by the previous Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government.The employees of Pims \u2014 one of the largest hospitals of the country and perhaps the only government-run state-of-the-art facility for patients in the entire northern region \u2014 say that this merger deprived them of basic rights such as gratuity, promotions, residence and other facilities offered to civil servants in federal departments.So they have decided to gather in front of their own \u2018Hyde Park\u2019 \u2014 the driveway in front of the Pims administration department \u2014 to demand a reversal of the decision. The protesters have given the government a deadline of Oct 18 to accept their demand for separation of the hospital from the university, and have threatened to escalate the protest if their demands are not met.  On this particular day, the protesters are charged up, rehearsing and bucking each other up to get ready for the final showdown.A dais has been set up for those who will make the speeches, while other staffers \u2014 some in uniform, others without \u2014 sit on chairs or stand in disciplined rows.     One of the speakers pauses mid-speech looking to catch a breath, and the warm air erupts with shouts of: \u201cVC ka jo yaar hai, ghaddaar hai ghaddaar hai. Hum sub aik hain, hum sub saath hain!\u201d(Whoever supports the vice chancellor is a traitor. We are one in our demand.)Raising his voice above the cacophony of sloganeering, Manzar Shah, a senior leader of the association, announces that they will set up beds and workstations in open air to treat serious patients in the OPD but will not work inside the hospital until their demands are met.Doctor Asfandyar Khan, another leader, suggests that they need to take the strike up a notch. \u201cEvery department has stopped working except one, the sanitation workers. We have asked them to continue working because that will be the final phase of the strike. The day they stop their work will be the day you will realise how far we can go,\u201d he says, while addressing the vice chancellor of SZAMBU and its senior officials.Then a song blares from the speakers: \u201cYe tera Pakistan hai, ye mera Pakistan hai, is ki bunyadon mein hai tera lahu, mera lahu.\u201d (This is your Pakistan and mine.

In Tests, Pakistan have handed out 229 caps, the latest being Haris Sohail. In One-day Internationals, Usman Khan was the 216th player to have received the privilege. Not all of them who were inducted made it, even though there were some outstanding talents among them. Consider Umer Akmal and Ahmed Shahzad, the latest to lose their places in the team. When they made their debuts, the great hope was that the two would anchor the next generation that was coming through. It wasn\u2019t to be. Both are now on the plate of katakut that will be swallowed whole, remembered only in passing as flavours of the moment or perhaps as analysts on the idiot box. But there were many others who lost their place despite needing more time to settle in or to sort their issues out. Below are seven batsmen who graced Pakistan cricket but were ushered out for one reason or the other, well before their Pakistan careers should have ended. \nUmer Akmal and Ahmed Shahzad have seemingly batted themselves out of contention but who were the other Pakistani batsmen whose promising careers were nipped in the bud? \nYASIR HAMEED\n\nYasir Hameed\n\n\nThere were murmurs that Yasir Hameed was addicted to naswar. Some believed the rumours, others didn\u2019t. But among the believers was the coach, Waqar Younis. Irked by having to constantly chide Hameed for his indulgences, Younis lost his cool when told that the batsman was now chewing naswar while on the crease.  The next time Hameed was padding up, Younis entered the dressing room and asked him to empty his pockets. Nothing there. Then the coach asked him to strip. Hameed did. Inside his undergarments was a packet of naswar, neatly stashed away from the prying eyes of his coach. That was the end of Yasir Hameed, a stylish batsman with a cover drive to die for but who became an advertisement for why professional sportsmen should stay away from drugs. ALI NAQVI\n\nAli Naqvi\n\n\nThe year was 1997 and South Africa had arrived in Pakistan for a tour that included three Test matches. Pakistan were searching for an opener and in came 20-year-old Ali Naqvi to partner skipper Saeed Anwar at the top of the order. Naqvi was so raw at the international level that the side match which got him selected was his first taste of first-class cricket in Pakistan (he had only played Grade-II cricket till then). The first match of the series was played in Rawalpindi. Pakistan handed debuts to three young men: Naqvi, Mohammad Ramzan and Azhar Mahmood. The first innings of the match was held together by two centuries, scored by Naqvi and Mahmood. While Mahmood batted supremely with the tail, Naqvi had been a constant as senior batmen around him came and went. The two ensured that Pakistan drew the match against a team led by Hansie Cronje and which boasted Alan Donald and Shaun Pollock in its bowling attack.But this sparkling beginning to his Test career proved to be a false start. He failed to score a 50 in the rest of the Test series, and although he was taken to tour Zimbabwe and South Africa in 1998, he didn\u2019t get a chance in the South African series and failed to impress in Zimbabwe. After playing five matches, Naqvi was dropped. He never returned to the team and another promising talent went to waste. MOHAMMAD WASIM\n\nMohammad Wasim\n\n\nThere was a time when the national selection committee was distributing Test caps like sweets, in the hopes of finding successors and backups to the batting line-up. Young Mohammad Wasim was the skipper of the Pakistan U-19 team, a technically correct batsman with style and elegance to boot. He got his chance against the visiting New Zealand team back in 1996, at the Gaddafi Stadium, after Wasim Akram pulled out of the match at the last minute. The 19-year-old\u2019s first outing bagged him a duck, but the second innings \u2014 a hundred in a losing cause \u2014 showcased the range of shots he could play in the \u2018V.\u2019 The on-drive in particular was divine as was his cover drive, both of which some believed were reminiscent of Zaheer Abbas. And while some of us believed that Pakistan\u2019s next big thing had been discovered, things didn\u2019t pan out that way. The 19-year-old got about a four-year look-in for the team, though never as a regular, but after 2000, he was summarily deemed not good enough. The numbers backed the selectors too: a Test average of just above 30 runs did not justify the bags of talent that Wasim had. His last Test was against Sri Lanka at Galle, where he scored a paltry 29 in what would become his last Test innings. Out of favour and perhaps out of luck too, Wasim headed to New Zealand in 2002 to play first-class cricket. With bags of runs under his belt, he was encouraged to return to Pakistan in 2005 so that he may be considered again for selection. But Inzamam-ul-Haq had become captain in 2003 and an air of religiosity now engulfed the team. The board and team management at the time believed that Wasim\u2019s dalliance with women fans and followers would inevitably drag the team into scandal. The captain\u2019s morality thus had the last laugh, depriving Pakistan of arguably the most aesthetic on-drives and cover drives since Zaheer Abbas graced the field.BASIT ALI\n\nBasit Ali\n\n\nHe was the second coming of Javed Miandad, while the original Miandad was still playing. On his day, he was as audacious as Miandad, could drag his team to victory from the jaws of defeat, and exasperated the opposition with his neat stroke-play. Ali was the like-for-like replacement for Miandad that Pakistan hoped would anchor the batting order for the next generation. But like many others, Ali scored a duck on his first outing against the West Indies in Port-of-Spain in 1993. The second innings saw Ali score a gritty 37 in a losing cause. Two more 50s followed in the remaining matches but over time, his inconsistency would go against him. But his debut series was also the one that arguably shaped his opinion about captain Wasim Akram as well as then vice-captain Waqar Younis. This was a time when there was no internet and news filtered through ever so slowly from other parts of the world. One morning, Pakistan woke up to news that Akram, Younis, fast-bowler Aqib Javed and leggie Mushtaq Ahmed had been arrested in Grenada. They were accompanied by two women tourists and a local man, on charges of \u201cbeing in possession of a controlled drug\u201d believed to be marijuana.Diplomatic intervention saved the Pakistanis of any major embarrassment but later on, the golden generation of Pakistan cricket became embroiled in match-fixing controversies. Ali eventually handed the following statement to a 1998 probe into match-fixing allegations: \u201cIt is absolutely false that I made some statement before Intikhab Alam confessing that I indulged in betting or match-fixing. It is also wrong that I retired because of the betting or match-fixing. As a matter of fact, circumstances created by the captain and the management were such that I had no option but to resign. Our team was divided into various groups after 1995. One comprising [Salim] Malik, Ijaz, Akram Raza, Ata-ur-Rehman and [Wasim] Akram and the other of Inzamam, myself, Mushtaq Ahmed and Waqar.\u201dBasit played his last Test in 1995 against New Zealand in New Zealand, and his last ODI in 1996 against South Africa in Sharjah. FAWAD ALAM\n\nFawad Alam\n\n\nDo you remember Graeme Hick? Yes the English batsman with 26 first-class centuries and widely considered to be a monster batsman at that level. Although Hick played 65 Test matches, his average of 31.32 was far below his 52.23 average at first-class level. The suspicion about him was that, as good a batsman as Hick was, he couldn\u2019t translate it on to international level because the standard of bowler at that level was a cut above the county level that he was used to. Many years later, in 2003, young Fawad Alam broke on to the first-class scene in Pakistan. His consistent scoring and handy left-arm spin would earn him a look-in at the national level in 2009, but as fate would have it, he never became a fixture in the squad let alone the team.In fact, under the captaincy of Misbah-ul-Haq when Pakistan\u2019s ODI team were struggling with their middle-order unable to rotate the strike, Alam remained in exile. Consider the talent that was introduced to the ODI team in Alam\u2019s place: Nasir Jamshed, Khalid Latif, Khurram Manzoor, Ahmed Shahzad, Umer Akmal, Umer Amin, Sohaib Maqsood, Mohammad Rizwan and Mohammad Nawaz to name a few. None of them could milk the bowlers for singles and doubles as effectively as Alam could. Perhaps it was Pakistan\u2019s desire to have boundary-hitters across their line-up. But it was a flawed strategy because often enough, the top would be wiped off by the opposition but not before the batsman had chewed up many overs in trying to get set. As a result, it came down to the likes of Misbah and Younis Khan to play the \u2018tuk-tuk\u2019 game to provide some respectability to the score. In the ODI game, in particular, Alam was and arguably still is a necessity. But his game isn\u2019t just restricted to ODIs, his Test average of 41.66 indicates solidity if not flamboyance. Alam was different to Graeme Hick in that he was translating his talent on to the international scene. And while Younis Khan in his brief stint as captain backed Alam, the selectors weren\u2019t convinced. Both his Test debut and his last Test came in the same year, 2009. His last Test, in New Zealand, was also Umer Amal\u2019s debut Test. The grapevine in the Karachi cricket circuit is that Alam\u2019s continued absence from the scene is because of his father \u2014 Tariq Alam made some friends in his playing days but seemingly made more enemies. Some also allege that a Karachi-Lahore rivalry is at play, with the Lahore-based PCB reluctant to hand over more Karachi-based players with responsibility. Notwithstanding the veracity of these claims, what we can all agree on is that one of Pakistan cricket\u2019s cult heroes has been hard done by. ASIM KAMAL\n\nAsim Kamal\n\n\nAt a time when Pakistan were struggling for some guts and consistency to the lower middle-order, they discovered Asim Kamal.  The year was 2003 and a gritty 99 on Test debut at the Gaddafi Stadium against South Africa proved that a special player had just entered the fray. He manoeuvred the field like Salim Malik, finding singles and doubles at will, and before the opposition knew it, Kamal was already batting on 30. The tour to India in 2005 confirmed that he was Pakistan\u2019s Wall. In a very short span of time, Kamal made a cult following. But Kamal was also a bit of a purist \u2014 given that he had established his credentials, he didn\u2019t take too kindly to the selectors putting him in the team for one series and dropping him the next. His last Test innings was also in Lahore, against England in 2005, where he scored a paltry five runs. A career average of 37.33 with no centuries in two years bear testament to another what-if story in Pakistan cricket. The worst part? So depressed was Kamal at his exclusion, at the Board, and at the system that he took a hiatus from cricket to rediscover his love for the game. He retired in 2015.ZULQARNAIN HAIDER\n\nZulqarnain Haider\n\n\nNever has a Pakistani hero gone out of limelight as quickly as Zulqarnain Haider did. The young wicketkeeper-batsman turned into a heartthrob overnight back in 2010 as he replaced Kamran Akmal in the line-up at Edgbaston and played a gritty innings of 88 in the second innings of his Test debut.The wicket-keeping mess seemed to have been resolved. But this was the summer of shame, as Pakistan cricket was buffeted by news that three of its superstars and match-winners were involved in fixing proceedings of a match. There was anxiety, there was fear, and there was suspicion. While Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were banned and put in jail, it was Haider whose career seemed to have nosedived the most.  Selectors believed he had more wicket-keeping potential than Kamran Akmal and stuck by him for a one-day series against South Africa in November. Midway through the series, however, Haider packed his bags, left the team hotel, and went to the United Kingdom in search of asylum. Nobody quite knows what transpired but the murmurs were that bookies had approached him and threatened him of dire consequences if he didn\u2019t relent. Much later, though, Haider said in an interview that he had \u201cspecific issues with a few players whom I won\u2019t like to name.\u201dHaider made his debut in the August of 2010.

Six flights per week from both Islamabad and Lahore were initially introduced with the premium service which included better meals and extended flight entertainment.In March this year, the department reportedly presented performance details before the lower house of parliament according to which, the premier service earned Rs1.8 billion in the first quarter against a spending of Rs3.9 billion. The service was closed down quietly in the subsequent month.\u2018Missing\u2019 aircraftSenator Rehman asked CAA and PIA officials about the circumstances in which an aircraft was moved to Malta for filming a movie and how it ended up in a German museum.The PIA authorities said the aircraft was grounded but was sold without mandatory approval of the board. Khursheed Shah said this is the first case that the PAC has referred to the newly appointed National Accountability Bureau (NAB), retired Justice Javed Iqbal.According to CAA documents, the flight-worthy plane was sold to a German museum for 57,000 Euros only. Lawmakers said this equals about Rs7 million and that one cannot even purchase a luxury car for this amount in Pakistan.CAA officials told the committee that this did not include the price of the engine and that efforts are being made to bring the engine back, which will be auctioned in accordance with the set procedure.Members of the committee said the engine may not be easy to retrieve and that the German company may also demand a parking fee.Outsourcing of airportsSecretary Aviation Division Irfan Ilahi told the PAC that the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is not going to outsource the airports of Karachi, Lahore and Islamabad since the Pakistan Air Force (PAF) also opposed the outsourcing of some vital services to private parties.He said that the National Aviation Policy allowed CAA to outsource certain services and the authority had invited bids from the interested parties. Mr Ilahi said that since PAF also utilizes CAA\u2019s facilities at some airports, it therefore opposed the outsourcing of services related to air traffic control and flight operations. CAA employees had challenged the outsourcing in the Islamabad and Lahore high courts.Mr Ilahi said the CAA had then decided to issue a licence for private operators to operate the car parking, restaurants and identical facilities. He said interested companies include Vinci of France, HNA of China and Turkish TAV and that the licence would be awarded one of them. He assured the PAC there will be no downsizing in the CAA\u2019s strength despite the handing over of certain services to private parties and surplus staff will be either posted at the new Islamabad airport or their services will be utilised by private contractors.Published in Dawn, October 12th, 2017\n", "title": "PAC special committee to probe sudden discontinuation of PIA Premier Service", "author": "Malik Asad"}, "1366246": {"date": "October 26, 2017", "article": "ISLAMABAD: Participants of a day-long conference on the Kigali Amendment on Wednesday stressed that getting rid of 13 ozone depleting substances (ODS) \u2013 including hydro chlorofluorocarbons (HCFC) and chlorofluorocarbons (CFC) - is imperative for protecting the ozone layer, which protects all life on earth and is a shield against the ultraviolet rays from the sun.Environmentalists, industrialists, manufacturers and academia pledged to work together with the climate change ministry to phase out the use of ozone layer depleting substances in Pakistan in according with the Montreal Protocol.The event was hosted by the Ozone Cell of the Ministry of Climate Change in collaboration with the United Nations Environment Program in order to discuss the various aspects and the way forward in regards to the use of ozone depleting gases in Pakistan.Participants deliberated over how harmful substances are splitting the ozone layer and that ozone depletion had led to a global concern as the thinning of the protective coat is letting harmful ultraviolet rays pass through, leading to many health hazards such as skin cancer, cataract and damage to plants.Participants were told that the ozone layer is a belt of naturally occurring gasses and sits 9.3 to 18.6 miles above earth. It serves as a shield from harmful ultraviolet B radiation from the sun. Ozone has a highly reactive molecule which contains three oxygen atoms. United Nations Environment Program Asia Pacific Regional Director Dechen Tsering, who was attending as chief guest, said ozone depleting substances generally contain chlorine, fluorine, bromine, carbon and hydrogen in varying proportions and are often described by the general term of halocarbons. Hydro chlorofluorocarbons, chlorofluorocarbons, carbon tetrachloride and methyl chloroform are important human-produced ozone-depleting gases that are used in many appliances including refrigeration, air conditioning, foam blowing, cleaning of electronics components and as solvents.She appreciated the commitment of Pakistan to phasing out ozone depleting substances under the Montreal Protocol, which was considered to be the most successful global environmental agreement setting out commitments by every country in the world to eliminate production and use of the chemicals that damaged the ozone layer. The Kigali Amendment was sealed during the 28th Meeting of Parties to the Montreal Protocol in the Rwandan capital and sought to phase down production and consumption of hydro fluorocarbons (HCFCs) to avoid up to 0.5 degrees centigrade of warming by 2100.Participants observed that Pakistan was able to reduce 10 pc use of HCFCs by 2015 under its HCFC Phase-out Management Plan (HPMP). The country is on track to achieve more than 35 pc reduction in HFC use in air conditioning systems, refrigerators and other appliances produced by the industrial sector in the country. Secretary Climate Change Ministry Syed Abu Ahmad Akif emphasized the need to rationalize or optimize the use of natural resources to protect humans, biodiversity and environment from devastating impacts of natural calamities including ozone depletion.He said using electric appliances, particularly air conditioning systems and refrigerators prudently would help reduce pressure on our energy systems and local heat impacts in our urban areas.Published in Dawn, October 26th, 2017\n", "title": "Industrialists, environmentalists to work jointly to phase out ozone-depleting gases", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter"}, "1364382": {"date": "October 17, 2017", "article": "THIS refers to Gilgit-Baltistan\u2019s issues related to education and travel.

I am struck by the overly positive read-out of the engagement in Pakistan\u2019s media. True, these efforts signify that the threat of an imminent breakdown of ties in the wake of US President Trump\u2019s unveiling of his administration\u2019s Afghanistan strategy has been averted. Still, we need to temper expectations. Ties remain in trouble. This won\u2019t change unless common ground is found on issues that really matter. One-off successes like the freeing of the kidnapped American-Canadian couple will offer breathing space \u2014 no more. For some years, Pakistan-US ties have been marked by persistent demands on both sides for the other to do more. However, there was also a recognition that they won\u2019t get nearly as much as they were asking for, and, more importantly, that there weren\u2019t any extreme measures worth the cost to force the other side to concede. The US has continued to press the issue of the Haqqani network and Afghan Taliban sanctuaries. Yet, previous administrations shied away from coercive measures against Pakistan, seeing these options as cost-prohibitive. Pakistani officials remained paranoid about America\u2019s long-term regional intentions. Still, there was no serious effort to pursue a regional policy without some sort of partnership with the US.  The desire to continue engaging remains intact on both sides. But the US ask that Pakistan eliminate Afghan insurgent sanctuaries has not changed. This is now a one-point agenda. Every conversation about Pakistan\u2019s long-term importance is in cold storage; the talk in Washington of employing coercive measures is louder than ever. Further, the current US foreign policy orientation holds a strong preference for quick, tangible results. \nThere\u2019s no room for complacency in Pak-US ties.\nThe dynamic on Pakistan\u2019s side doesn\u2019t instil much confidence in the future of ties either. Pakistani officials sense the delicacy of the moment and thus will want to work out feasible concessions to the US that signal positive intent and avoid harsh action. Beyond this though, acquiescing fully to the US ask regarding the Haqqanis and Taliban has never been seen favourably. If anything, the current environment will likely reinforce the reluctance to bite the bullet. I sense consensus within Pakistani officialdom on two points: the new US strategy is seen as one aimed at defeating the Taliban on the battlefield rather than politically accommodating them; and that this approach is certain to work to Pakistan\u2019s disadvantage (and to India\u2019s advantage). Corollary: all-out support to the strategy will continue to be seen as self-defeating. Also, while the aura of unpredictability around US foreign policy in general is making decision-makers nervous, it is also forcing some within the system to argue that Pakistan must proactively plan for a minus-US scenario. If so, Pakistan\u2019s current engagement with the US may signify a buy-time approach. Meanwhile, one could expect Pakistan to proactively try and influence US strategy, most likely by pushing for a politics-first approach that seeks to accommodate the Taliban sooner rather than later. Here\u2019s the problem. The US is set to remain focused on the sanctuaries and opposes any proposal that may detract from this. Pakistan will be hoping to use its initial flexibility (for example, by actions such as freeing the hostages) to pull Washington away from its maximum ask. Yet, the Washington policy community may interpret Pakistan\u2019s flexibility as evidence that Trump\u2019s tough talk is working. The inclination would be to hunker down further. But desired results on the US\u2019s principal ask will still not be forthcoming. At the same time, Pakistan\u2019s political appetite to absorb public rebuke would be limited in an election year. Any propensity by the political elite to respond emotively will further em\u00ad\u00adpower the Washing\u00adton voices who want to see Pakistan punished. And as temperatures rise, those within the Pakistani system advocating a minus-US formula will gain traction. This is a recipe for disaster. For things to work out differently, both sides must acknowledge the elephant in the room: a mutual feeling that each side\u2019s preferred endgame in Afghanistan is unacceptable to the other. Pakistan believes the US is pursuing a \u2018basing\u2019 strategy that will leave its troops and bases in Afghanistan indefinitely. The goal, as internalised by the policy enclave, would be to keep the region (Pakistan, China, Russia, Iran) off-balance; India would gain further ground. The US is convinced that Pakistan continues to provide active support to Afghan insurgents to prevent US gains and keep the Taliban strong to counter India. But the US does not buy Pakistan\u2019s take on India; it sees the military as paranoid in this regard. These deep divergences are not easily reconciled. Yet, till they are, the ties will remain on the brink.

border town of Jarabulus wrested from IS last week, the Turkish forces and their Syrian rebel allies on Tuesday engaged IS fighters west of the town, Turkish media said.Turkish warplanes later conducted air strikes against \u201cterrorist\u201d targets nearby, the state-run Anadolu agency said, referring to IS.Turkey sees the YPG as an offshoot of the rebel Kurdistan Workers\u2019 Party (PKK), which is waging a bloody insurgency against security forces in Turkey\u2019s southeast.In the past few months, Turkey has watched in alarm as the PKK\u2019s Syrian Kurdish allies advance on the other side of the border, fearing their territorial expansion will strengthen the PKK.However, the US-led anti-IS coalition has been backing the YPG with training and equipment.Washington described weekend clashes between Turkey and the Kurdish-led forces as \u201cunacceptable\u201d and urged the warring parties to stop fighting each other and concentrate on combating IS.Turkish media reported that Ankara summoned the US ambassador to protest the US criticism.A spokesman for the Turkish foreign ministry, however, told AFP that there was only a \u201cphone call\u201d to the ambassador, John Bass.Iran urges Turkey to end Syria interventionTurkey\u2019s offensive has also raised concerns that Ankara could be drawn even deeper into the Syrian conflict.Iran, a key backer of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime, urged Turkey to quickly wrap up its campaign, calling it a violation of Syrian sovereignty.Turkey has said Syria was informed in advance of the operation by Russia.Meanwhile, the Turkish army, which lost a soldier last week to anti-tank fire, suffered further casualties.Three Turkish soldiers were injured in a rocket attack on a tank near Jarabulus, according to Turkish television.On Tuesday, Turkish troops and their rebel allies came under attack in IS-held territory to the west of Jarabulus, with the jihadists claiming to have destroyed two Turkish tanks in a missile attack.The group also claimed to have carried out a suicide car bombing against Turkish-backed rebels in the same area and said it had killed \u201cdozens\u201d of Turkish soldiers and Turkish-backed rebels.Kalin said the Jarabulus operation had killed a \u201cmyth\u201d that the Kurdish militia was the only effective force on the ground in the fight against IS, adding: \u201cThe moderate Syrian opposition, if supported, could put up an effective fight.\u201dPublished in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "title": "Turkey denies truce with Syrian Kurdish militia", "author": "AFP"},

revamped ruling council, cementing his grip on power and setting the stage for him to dominate China for decades to come.In a highly choreographed event, Xi led the new members of the elite Politburo Standing Committee in front of television cameras at Beijing's massive Great Hall of the People after their selection by 204 party officials in a closed-door vote.Xi, 64, secured a second five-year term as general secretary of the Communist Party after his eponymous political theory was enshrined in its constitution, giving him an inviolable mandate to rule and possibly positioning him to retain power for much longer.He was also reappointed head of the country's Central Military Commission.Premier Li Keqiang, 62, retained his seat on the seven-member committee while five other men \u2014 all little known outside China \u2014 replaced comrades who had reached an informal retirement age of 68.\n\nThe Communist Party of China's new Politburo Standing Committee, the nation's top

more importantly make new accomplishments.\"But the new ruling council looked decidedly old, raising doubts that any could succeed Xi.\"Xi Jinping doesn't want to share power. He doesn't want someone breathing down his neck, preparing the succession,\" Jean-Pierre Cabestan, China specialist at Hong Kong Baptist University, told AFP. \"He wants to keep pressure on everybody and enjoy power for five or 10 years without having his hands tied.\"All the committee's members are at least 60 years of age. Under the current rules, they would be too old to serve the customary two terms as the party's leader at the next congress in 2022.Xi was elevated to the committee in 2007, when he was 54, and succeeded Hu Jintao as general secretary and president five years later.Anti-graft crusade\nIn the past two administrations, decisions were the result of horse-trading and consultation among members of the standing committee, the council of party elders which has led China since Deng's death in 1997.But with his name in the constitution, Xi has become the nation's ultimate authority, likely giving him the last word on all major decisions.The document's \"all-round embracing of Xi's thought reflects the high degree of consensus the Party has built around its leadership core,\" the state-run China Daily wrote in an editorial Wednesday.During his speech, Xi called for ever stricter management of the party, suggesting his grip on power will only increase.Over the last five years, he has waged a ruthless campaign on official corruption, but party discipline is \"a journey to which there is no end,\" he said, calling on members to \"rid ourselves of any virus that erodes the party's fabric.\"At least one important figure did not make the cut, as Xi's right-hand man Wang Qishan, 69, vacated his standing committee seat.Analysts had thought the leader of the country's anti-corruption campaign might be kept on in defiance of the party's unofficial guideline that cadres retire at 68.The BBC, The Economist, the Financial Times, The Guardian and the New York Times were denied invitations to cover the unveiling despite wide access granted to other news outlets, according to the Foreign Correspondents\u2019 Club of China.\u201cIt is hard to avoid the conclusion that these media organisations have been singled out to send a message,\u201d it said in a statement, adding that using access as a tool to punish journalists violated principles of press freedom.\n", "title": "China's Xi secures second term with no heir in sight", "author": "AFP"}, "1366695": {"date": "October 28, 2017", "article": "UNITED NATIONS: United Nations investigators on Thursday blamed a sarin gas massacre on Bashar al-Assad\u2019s regime, as the United States renewed its warning that he has no role in Syria\u2019s future.The expert panel\u2019s report and tough remarks by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson overshadowed the announcement that UN-sponsored peace talks will resume next month.More than 80 people died on April 4 this year when sarin gas projectiles were fired into Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the Idlib province of north-western Syria.Images of dead and dying victims, including young children, in the aftermath of the attack provoked global outrage and a US cruise missile strike on a regime air base.The UN placed the death toll at 83 while the UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said it was 87.\nSyria and its ally Russia had suggested that a rebel weapon may have detonated on the ground but the UN panel confirmed Western intelligence reports that blamed the regime.\u201cThe panel is confident that the Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Sheikhun on April 4, 2017,\u201d the report, seen by AFP, says.The report will increase pressure on Assad\u2019s regime just as Washington, in the wake of battlefield victories against the militant Islamic State (IS) group, renews calls for him to step down.Secretary of State Rex Tillerson\u2019s comments to reporters came during a visit to Geneva in which he met UN envoy Staffan de Mistura, who is trying to convene a new round of peace talks next month.The secretary said US policy has not changed, but his remarks represented tougher language from an administration that had previously said Assad\u2019s fate is not a priority.\u201cWe do not believe there is a future for the Assad regime, the Assad family,\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cI think I\u2019ve said it on a number of occasions.

The formalised neighbourhood watch patrols come out in full force during special events like the congress, which is being held mostly behind closed doors and will likely hand Xi a second five-year term when it ends on Tuesday. The civilians are just one piece of the comprehensive security apparatus for the conclave: from black-uniformed guards who stand sentry on pavements to identification checks at subway stations. While they see themselves as providers of a public service, their presence is a reminder of the scrutiny that the Communist authorities maintain over citizens. \u201cWe're in the business of improving people's quality of life,\u201d said Ma Shuying, a 60-year-old party member who was patrolling the area underneath a bridge in Beijing's city centre. Ma arrived at her spot at 7:00 am on the opening day of the congress on Wednesday, ready to look out for trouble. In her 17 years as a member of the patrol, Ma has witnessed few incidents, she said, because \u201cBeijing is so safe.\u201d \u201cWe're more here to give community members a sense of security,\u201d she beamed, undeterred by the grey smog and light rain. \u201cPeople see us and feel that they're being taken care of.

Despite their striking \u201cvolunteer\u201d armbands, many of the patrollers approached by AFP appeared not to be serving the people for free. One middle-aged woman standing outside a subway station looked up from her phone long enough to say that it was \u201ccompany policy\u201d not to speak to reporters. Another two armband-wearers who were helping to direct traffic in a busy commercial district appeared bewildered when asked whether they were volunteers. \u201cWe're working,\u201d said a woman who looked harried as she pointed a driver to a parallel parking spot. \u201cThey just gave us these armbands to wear.\u201d Even Ma, who also handles Communist Party affairs on her neighbourhood committee, earns 3,000 yuan ($450) a month for performing her duties. These range from telling people about their retirement benefits to helping them rid their homes of mice. \u201cAll my neighbours know me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives me a warm feeling inside.\u201d Several other volunteers declined to be interviewed, either because they were \u201con duty\u201d or were concerned that a foreign journalist would not lend \u201cpositive energy\u201d to their vocation. 'Hope for our country'\nSome of the neighbourhood patrollers were truly volunteers, claiming no benefits other than the joys of the job. Standing outside a shopping centre, a 68-year-old who only gave his surname, Ren, complained about the air pollution.While major political events in Beijing generally enjoy blue skies brought on by government-ordered factory shutdowns, the party congress has faced rainy weather and grey air. Ren's daughter lives in Vancouver, Canada, where the air is much better, he said. But he doesn't plan on moving there. \u201cMy whole life is in China,\u201d he said. Ren started volunteering during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. His main duty, he said, has been giving tourists directions. Like many volunteers, he was impressed by Xi's lengthy opening speech on Wednesday. \u201cThe problem of corruption has not entirely been solved, but the general mood is different,\u201d Ren said. \u201cIn the past, whenever you went to the supermarket during holidays you would see officials splurging, and everyone knew they were spending public funds.\u201d Ma proudly remarked that Xi's anti-graft campaign was going strong even in her small neighbourhood office, where she isn't allowed to use the computers to shop online or play video games. \u201cBecause of the president's efforts against corruption, there is hope for our party and there is hope for our country,\u201d she said. Yang Zhiling, 69, who was collecting rubbish around a bike rack, said she was inspired by Xi's stamina. \u201cPresident Xi remained standing for a whole three and a half hours!

Fallujah has fallen in the west and Iraqi forces have captured key approaches to Mosul, the ancient Tigris city whose fall in 2014 signalled the group\u2019s lightning rise.Meanwhile, advances by a US-backed coalition in Syria have all but cut IS off from the Turkish border, after the loss of the key town of Manbij, and started to press into its Euphrates valley heartland.Few people expect further advances against IS to be rapid or straightforward, but the group\u2019s enemies have built a clear momentum in both Iraq and Syria that has pushed it to adopt a strategy of attacks overseas.Adnani was the man behind that policy, demonstrating an ideological and tactical flexibility that allowed the group first to capitalise on its seizure of land, and then to adapt as it was forced to retreat.In doing so, IS has made a switch in emphasis from its dreams of unifying all Muslims under a single, militant caliphate, to an older jihadist strategy of striking terror into its enemies by attacking them in their own countries.But it has done this partly by harnessing shock tactics and social media to inspire and guide attacks by radicalised amateurs, rather than rely solely upon the highly trained but cumbersome militant cells of an earlier era. This, in part, was Adnani\u2019s legacy.Apocalyptic prophecy The IS said on Tuesday Adnani was killed \u201cwhile surveying the operations to repel the military campaigns against Aleppo. His presence in the Aleppo countryside may reflect its strategic and symbolic importance to IS. The northwest has become both the most active theatre of Syria\u2019s war and an arena for competing regional and global powers.The government and mainstream rebel groups, which between them hold most of Syria\u2019s western, most populous, regions, have focused on their battle for control of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s biggest city before the war, and a strategic prize.But to the north and east, a secondary conflict has played out as US-backed Kurdish fighters and Turkey-backed rebels, who are also fighting each other, have squeezed IS\u2019s once expansive tracts along the Turkish border and Euphrates basin.These advances have all but cut off IS from its last foothold on the Turkish border, its link to new foreign recruits, while a steady push from the north has brought its enemies to within 30km of its Syrian capital Raqqa.But these strategic setbacks are not IS\u2019s only interest in the Aleppo countryside: just 30km northwest of al-Bab is the village of Dabiq.A few streets surrounded by fields, it will be the site, says Islamic prophecy, of a final battle between Muslims and infidels that will herald the apocalypse.So important is this event in IS propaganda, of which Adnani was the chief, that Dabiq was the name chosen for its online magazine that sought to inspire new recruits to its militant cause and instruct them in the ways of global jihad.Hammered Hammered by two years of US-led coalition air strikes and military losses on the ground, Adnani increasingly called in audio messages for attacks against the United States and Western countries. His group said it was behind deadly attacks in Paris, Nice and Brussels.The shift was partly born of tactical necessity after Western and regional governments made it harder for would-be militants to travel to Syria or Iraq to join the group.\u201cIf the tyrants close the door of migration in your faces, then open the door of jihad in theirs and turn their actions against them,\u201d he said in an audio clip.Born in 1977 as Taha Subhi Falaha in Syria\u2019s Idlib Province southwest of Aleppo, he pledged allegiance to IS\u2019s predecessor, Al Qaeda, more than a decade ago and was once imprisoned by US forces in Iraq.He left Syria to travel to Iraq to fight US forces there after its 2003 invasion, and only returned to his homeland after the start of its own civil war in 2011, a person who knew his family said. A biography posted on militant websites says he grew up with a \u201clove of mosques\u201d and was a prolific reader.A US counterterrorism official who monitors IS said Adnani\u2019s death would hurt the militants \u201cin the area that increasingly concerns us as the group loses more and more of its caliphate and its financial base ... and turns to mounting and inspiring more attacks in Europe, Southeast Asia and elsewhere\u201d.Hisham al-Hashimi, a Baghdad-based security analyst that advises the Iraqi government on IS affairs, said: \u201cAs a military target, Adnani is less important than [ex war minister Omar] al-Shishani...(killed earlier this year in Iraq). His death is mainly a blow to their morale, he is the one who inspires the fighters to join in Syria.\u201d-ReutersPublished in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "title": "Death of IS tactician comes at critical moment", "author": "Angus McDowall | Samia Nakhoul"}, "1368016": {"date": "November 03, 2017", "article": "BAHAWALPUR: Pakistan Tahreek-i-Insaf (PTI) Chairman Imran Khan on Thursday warned of increase in pollution and smog in the country and urged the youth to come forward to control it.

It states, amongst other things, that the incidence of pollution is changing: concerns about ambient air, soil and chemical pollution are now greater than apprehensions relating to impure household air and water. This type of pollution is produced by \u201cindustry, mining, electricity generation, mechanised agriculture, and petroleum-powered vehicles\u201d, each of which is growing in Pakistan. The fastest-growing polluters in the world are developing countries with high rates of growth coming from sectors that rely on these activities. This poses serious health risks to the most vulnerable populations, the poor, minorities and children. Beyond health, the study points out that pollution has consequences for the economy as well, and in some cases can reduce the growth rate of an economy by up to two percentage points. This is important to bear in mind for a number of reasons. First, winter brings with it the smog that usually engulfs parts of Sindh and Punjab, causing a spike in respiratory ailments amongst much else, besides disrupting travel and business. Second, our future growth is heavily dependent on some of the industries listed in the study as the crux of the problem, especially coal-fired power plants. It can be argued that we need these industries to secure our future economic growth, but it must be asked what is being done to assess and mitigate the pollution impact that they are going to have. Third, with our push towards large-scale thermal power generation as part of the capacity expansion plan these days, it must also be asked whether we are locking ourselves out of the revolution under way in clean renewable energy. That revolution is sweeping across the world, replacing power from dirty fuels and electric cars that reduce emissions, while we are investing further in 19th-century technologies that are not only expensive, but bring their own health hazards with them. In the case of climate change, Pakistan\u2019s argument has always been that it is not a major contributor of carbon emissions, and the impact is felt globally. But that cannot be said for pollution. We are already suffering from high levels of pollution, with some of the worst urban air quality in the region and the seasonal winter smog engulfing several areas of the country \u2014 and, in large part, the driver for this is local.

The situation was particularly alarming in south and central Punjab. It was not good in Lahore either. But the Environment Protection Department (EPD) officials said control over local pollution contributions thinned the lower layer of smog though its upper layer further thickened because of enhanced incursion of smoke and ash of the crop stubble being burnt on a large scale in the adjoining Indian Punjab. Officials claimed emissions from the Sahiwal coal power project too were contributing to pollutants causing smog in the plains of the province. Smog had developed in Punjab last year too, irritating eyes and throat, and causing breathing problems for people outdoors. People in Lahore and other cities in the central and southern Punjab are once again facing the same problems for the past three or four days as the authorities try to grapple with the situation. The general perception is rain is the only hope which can clear off the phenomenon. Officials said SUPARCO spotted 2,620 fire incidents through satellite in Indian Punjab in the last 24 hours. There were just 27 in Pakistan\u2019s Punjab where torching crop residues has been banned under Section 144. The authorities have registered 151 cases and arrested 43 farmers for violations.

Crop stubble burning is also causing smog over a large area in India, and media reports say it has failed to control the pollution-causing practice despite public outcry and censure by courts. The EDP officials said smog was creating problems for people in Bhakkar and it has also reached KP\u2019s Dera Ismail Khan and Sindh areas adjoining Punjab. \u201cOnly rain and strong westerly wind can reverse the worsening situation,\u201d a Met department official said. He forecast dry weather in the next at least one week. An EPD official said more steel re-rolling mills were sealed in northeastern Lahore in the last 24 hours (Thursday), raising the number of such mills to more than 130. There are 350 mills in the city and the remaining have been allowed to function on the condition that they would not burn used tyres. As many as 11,203 smoke-emitting vehicles, mainly diesel, have been challaned and 1,145 impounded in Lahore and other smog-hit cities in the past few days.Published in Dawn, November 3rd, 2017\n", "title": "Punjab, other provinces grapple with debilitating effects of smog", "author": "Intikhab Hanif"}, "1367965": {"date": "Published Nov 03, 2017 03:50pm", "article": "\n\nNot always a Christian shrine\n\n\nA symbol of Partition\n\n\nThe smoke of the hashish spread through the air as Basheer took a puff from his cigarette, staring at me through kohl-smeared eyes. He had a thick, long white beard, though his hair was neatly trimmed. Through the open buttons of his kameez, I could see a taveez hanging from a black thread. Such an amulet usually contains verses from a holy book written on a piece of paper. I wondered what holy book Basheer had \u2013 the Quran, the Bible or the Granth Sahib? Sitting with his back to a small shrine in an open field, he handed over the hashish-filled cigarette to his young companions. Were they here just for a smoke or did the shrine represent something to them?Hashish and bhang (both made from cannabis) play a central role in folk shrines across the country. I call them folk shrines because most of them, despite their outward religious associations, do not strictly fall within the bracket of religious traditions. They represent an indigenous religiosity that connects the thread of diverse religious traditions of this land. Sufi malangs have in their poetry and literature referred to hashish as al-luqaymah (little green bite), musilat al-qalb (what binds with the heart) and waraq-i kheyal (leaf of insight). In several Sufi shrines across the country, one would come across devotees gathered around a fire smoking hashish or consuming bhang. Similarly, in ascetic traditions associated with Shaivism, the consumption of hashish is almost part of religious rituals. In Vedic literature, the use of cannabis is mentioned as a bestower of joy, a liberator.\u201cThis is the shrine of Baba Gur Baksh Masih,\u201d Basheer told me. Masih is the Arabic word for messiah, a title reserved for Jesus Christ. It is a word the Christian community uses today for its self-identification in Pakistan. However, it is not the word Muslims use for the Christian community \u2013 they use Isaai, followers of Prophet Isa, the name for Jesus in the Quran. While Isaai is now popularly recognised as the word for Christians in Pakistan, it is not a title the Christians necessarily associate with. However, power relationships between the two communities have forced this identification upon them, despite their reluctance. This is similar to Muslims being referred to as Mohammadens. Many Christians in Pakistan also use Masih as a surname.Not always a Christian shrine\nThe shrine behind us was a simple structure \u2013 a short boundary wall with no roof, with the grave of the saint at the centre, covered in green cloth, similar to the cloths used to cover graves at Muslim Sufi shrines. Like in Sufi shrines, a turban and garlands decorated the grave, symbolising the groom and bride-like relationship between the saint and the divine. Green, a colour usually associated with Islam, was used to paint the decorative niches and false architectural pillars. At the entrance, however, was a cross, identifying this as a Christian shrine. In fact, this shrine in the small village of Maraka, about 20km south-west of Lahore, is popularly known as Isaaian da mazaar (shrine of Christians). Once again, one can tell that this is not a name chosen by the devotees of the shrine.But this was not always a Christian shrine. \u201cBaba Gur Baksh Masih was a follower of Guru Nanak,\u201d Basheer said. \u201cHe lost his life in a battle. During combat his head was severed but his body continued to fight until it eventually came and rested at this spot, where later a shrine was constructed to commemorate his life and death.\u201d\n\nBasheer at the Isaaian da mazaar in Maraka village. Photo credit: Haroon Khalid.\n\n\nThe history told by Basheer and several others in rural Punjab who have not had a formal education is not measured in years but through events. In this framework, Partition becomes a pivotal point, the ultimate divider of eras. Basheer does not know exactly how old this shrine is but knows that it predates Partition. So, in its original form it would be fair to suggest that instead of a grave, this shrine must have hosted the smadh of Baba Gur Baksh. Perhaps it did not actually contain the remains of Baba Gur Baksh but was a symbolic shrine built to commemorate the legend of Bhai Gurbaksh Singh, who sacrificed his life to defend the Harmandir Sahib in Amritsar from the onslaught of the Afghan king Ahmad Shah Abdali. Whatever it was in its past incarnation, the shrine today serves as the central communal space for Christians of the village. They not only gather here for the annual festival of the shrine, much like devotees of a Sufi shrine, but also for conventional Christian celebrations such as Easter and Christmas.A symbol of Partition\nThe story of this shrine is the story of Partition. Maraka was a pre-dominantly Sikh village whose occupants fled to the other side of the border to escape the bloodshed. However, several of these wealthy Sikh landlords left behind servants to look after their property and belongings. Like millions of others, they felt the riots of Partition were a temporary madness and they would return to their ancestral homes as soon as the situation returned to normal.The majority of Christians who live in Maraka today are descendants of the servants of those landlords. Most of them were Mazhabi Sikhs, a title reserved for Sikhs who converted to Sikhism from lower castes. Sikhism in this case was no different from Islam in South Asia. Both these religions were principally against the caste system but in practice retained remnants of caste hierarchy. Lower caste Hindus who became Muslims came to be known as Musali or Deendar and in many cases continued to be treated as untouchables. In Sikhism, they became Mazhabi Sikhs.For as long as they could, these Mazhabi Sikhs retained their religious identity. But as soon as the fire of the riots approached, they cut off their hair, removed their turbans and embraced Christianity, a neutral religion, to stay alive. Christianity from Partition onwards became a part of their identity. The shrine of Baba Gur Baksh, too, eventually saw this transition. Similar to the name Isaai, the Christian identity, too, was forced on this shrine and the community.\nThis article was originally published on Scroll and has been reproduced with permission.\nHave you visited any places that promote social harmony?

Rozon, who also founded Montreal's prominent \u201cJust For Laughs\u201d comedy festival, is a jury member on \u201cFrance Has Incredible Talent,\u201d whose 12th season had been due to premiere October 26 until broadcaster M6 pulled the plug on Thursday. Nine women went public Wednesday with allegations of sexual misconduct by Rozon, triggering a shockwave in Quebec hard on the heels of the revelations targeting Harvey Weinstein, the disgraced movie mogul accused by dozens of actresses of sexual harassment, assault and rape. Rozen stood down later on Wednesday as head of Montreal's 375th anniversary celebrations and vice-president of the metropolitan Montreal Board of Trade, and later took to Facebook to apologise, while stopping short of admitting guilt. \u201cShaken by the allegations against me, I want to dedicate all my time to review the matter,\u201d Rozon wrote. \u201cTo all those who I may have offended in my life, I'm sincerely sorry.\u201d Rozon wrote that he was resigning \u201cout of respect for the employees and the families that work for these organisations as well as all our partners.\u201d Prime Minister Justin Trudeau spoke out on Thursday regarding the allegations, saying the issue of harassment \u201cmeans the world to me.\u201d \u201cI think we're seeing a moment of awakening, whether it's the news from Hollywood [...] or now what we're seeing in the Quebec cultural areas,\u201d Trudeau said. \u201cIt's unacceptable for anyone to feel insecure or harassed at work, at home, in the streets. And I think people are beginning to get it.\u201d 'Powerful man'\nMontreal mayor Denis Coderre also expressed his \u201cdismay and disappointment\u201d at the Rozen accusations while Quebec Minister for Women Helen David praised a \u201ccultural change\u201d that has resulted in more women speaking out.Canadian police have meanwhile encouraged other potential victims to come forward, saying in a Twitter message: \u201cWe are listening.\u201d Nine women interviewed by the daily Le Devoir and local radio station 98.5 FM claimed Rozon sexually harassed or assaulted them. Most worked in the arts, and some said they were teenagers at the time of the incidents, the latest having allegedly taken place in 2016. \u201cHe harassed me for several months,\u201d Anne-Marie Charette told Le Devoir. \u201cI felt really small, knowing that he was a powerful man. I had the strength to push him away, but not to go to the police.\u201d Others who accused Rozon of harassment or rape over the past three decades include television host Penelope McQuade, actors Salome Corbo and Sophie Moreau, director Lyne Charlebois, and entrepreneur Genevieve Allard. \u201cWhen this behaviour continues over decades and affects women of diverse backgrounds, I think it must stop,\u201d Corbo told Le Devoir. She alleged that Rozon sexually assaulted her when she was 14 years old. Rozon pleaded guilty in 1998 and was fined for sexually assaulting a 19-year-old woman at a \u201cJust For Laughs\u201d reception, but the record was later expunged. He reportedly tried to caress the woman and bring her back to his hotel room, but she fled and informed the venue's managers of the incident. Shining a light\nRozon, 62, is the driving force behind Montreal's annual \u201cJust for Laughs\u201d comedy festival. The event, which began in 1983, is billed as the world's largest international comedy festival. His resignation came after Quebec humorist Guillaume Wagner publicly accused him of being an \u201caggressor\u201d in the wake of the snowballing allegations. Wagner said he was encouraged to speak out after another Quebec celebrity, TV show host Eric Salvail, was suspended over allegations of sexual misconduct this week. The Weinstein case has shone a light on Hollywood's seedy underbelly, but has also prompted women in and outside the film world to go public with allegations of assault and harassment, most prominently in the #MeToo phenomenon on social media.\n", "title": "After Harvey Weinstein, Canadian producer hit by sexual misconduct allegations", "author": "AFP"}, "1362561": {"date": "Updated October 09, 2017", "article": "KABUL: The US forces are helping the militant Isla\u00admic State group in Afghan\u00adistan, Hamid Karzai, the country\u2019s former president, alleged in a controversial interview aired on Sunday.Asked whether he had suspicions that US bases were being used to aid the IS, he said: \u201cI have more than suspicions.\u201d he said.\u2018The former president claimed in an exclusive interview with Russia Today in London he had heard reports, albeit unconfirmed, that the IS was being supplied with helicopters.\u201c\u2018How unmarked non-military colour helicopters supply these people, not only in one part of the country but in many regions,\u201d Mr Karzai wondered. \u201cAnd this is a daily occurrence,\u201d He also claimed that the terror group has been able to spread its tentacles in the country just under the nose of the US forces and the CIA.Asked if he agreed with a notion that the IS was a US construct, he replied: \u201cAbsolutely.\u201d Hamid Karzai said Afghan extremism had grown stronger since the 9/11 terror attack, although the US had spent billions of dollars in the \u201cwar against terror\u201d.\u201cWe don\u2019t want our country to be bombed with huge, destructive weapons.

This will cause a sharp rise in the retail price of home appliances and electronics that have become a necessity today.

The economy grew 6.8pc in the third quarter of the year, and 6.9pc in the first half. Last year\u2019s growth rate of 6.7pc was a 26-year low.China\u2019s economy has surprised global markets and investors with robust growth so far this year, driven by a renaissance in its long-ailing \u201csmokestack\u201d industries such as steel and stronger demand from Europe and the United States.But economists with Societe Generale said in a recent note that the winter output cuts could slash industrial production growth by 0.6-0.8pcage points and GDP growth by 0.2-0.25pcage points in the next six months.Industrial growth slowed to 6.3pc in the third quarter, from 6.6pc in the previous period, data showed last week, with the services sector taking up much of the slack.Prices of commodities like steel, copper and iron ore have turned wildly volatile in China and in global markets recent weeks on fears of possible winter shortages.China\u2019s steel output dropped 3.7pc in September from a record high the previous month as mills reduced production in line with Beijing\u2019s campaign, and analysts predict further declines as winter curbs set in.However, Zhang Yong, vice-chairman of the NDRC, told reporters that the direct impact was likely to be limited.\u201cMeasures to fight pollution don\u2019t have a big impact on economic growth,\u201d he said. \u201cMeasures to treat pollution have a positive impact on economic development in the long term.\u201d The government has been pushing a restructuring programme designed to \u201cupgrade\u201d its heavy industrial economy, cut pollution and tackle profit-sapping capacity gluts in sectors like steel and coal.China says it has cut annual crude steel capacity by as much as 110 million tonnes over the last five years, with coal capacity slashed by as much as 400m tonnes, though some analysts say much of the outdated, inefficient plants are merely being replaced with leaner, cleaner ones.Ning Jizhe, vice head of the NDRC and also head of China\u2019s National Bureau of Statistics, said the country would continue to crack down on steel overcapacity, prevent obsolete plants from restarting and promote more mergers in the sector.Published in Dawn, October 22nd, 2017\n", "title": "China still on track to hit growth target despite winter smog war", "author": "Reuters"}, "1364703": {"date": "October 19, 2017", "article": "KARACHI: The first Karachi Biennale will be organised from Oct 22 to Nov 5 at 12 venues, announced the CEO Karachi Biennale Trust (KBT) Niilofur Farrukh at a press conference at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday. Ms Farrukh said biennales took place in more than 100 cities of the world, signifying their association and relationship with those cities. It\u2019s primarily an art exhibition held at different places in different ways. The first biennale in the world was organised in Venice more than a century ago after which it spread to other parts of the globe. In the last two decades it gained tremendous popularity in developing countries. One of the reasons was that people wanted their art to be shown in their countries. More than 140 local and international artists would be exhibiting their work at Karachi Biennale. Twelve venues were chosen for the purpose, six of which were, Ms Farrukh said, on Bandar Road (now M.A. Jinnah Road), and one of which was NJV School. Pioneer Book House, Jamshed Memorial Hall and Frere Hall were some of the other places she mentioned. There was also Capri cinema at which a film made by a Canadian artist would be screened. Apart from exhibitions, activities had been planned for schoolchildren and families.    Trade union activist Karamat Ali said for the last 30 years Karachi had been a victim of wear and tear (toot phoot). Extremism had taken its toll on the city. Art provided us with an opportunity to think, and helped us come out of the atmosphere of fear. Journalist Ghazi Salahuddin said Karachi was dubbed by some a \u201cdangerous city\u201d. It needed to be a living, breathing town. We must understand the importance of public spaces. Art inculcated in us a sense of belonging and introduced us to beauty. \u201cI hope it will make some difference,\u201d he remarked. Chief curator of Karachi Biennale Amin Gulgee said he and his team had been working on the project since August last year. He especially mentioned five of his young colleagues. He told the media they worked with no funding and everyone did their bit on a voluntary basis. \u201c[They say] Karachi is a dangerous, dirty city but everywhere in the world I went I received nothing but love. Everybody was willing to come to Karachi.\u201d Aquila Ismail said art education for children did not only mean that they were learning how to make art but also enabled them to see the beauty and ugliness of the environment. Chairperson KBT Almas Bana said even an illiterate person would be able to appreciate pictures, which meant that the language of art was there before we began to write and read. He highlighted that Karachi Biennale was Pakistan\u2019s first such event [not just Karachi\u2019s]. Asma Ibrahim said when their team set out to plan the event they had three objectives: how to take art to the common man; how to take it to the level of schools; and how to combine art and heritage. The event is free of charge and will be formally inaugurated on Oct 21 at NJV School.Published in Dawn, October 19th, 2017\n", "title": "Karachi Biennale from 22nd", "author": "Peerzada Salman"}, "1367468": {"date": "Updated October 31, 2017", "article": "We go to sleep at 1:45am on Saturday morning because after settling Pakistan\u2019s ecstatic win in the 2nd T20 against Sri Lanka, we watch the highlights until the ads refuse to stop running.

There is a novelty to this feeling that has been lacking for a long time, courtesy of the ugly politics, and horrible fitness levels that have marked Pakistani men\u2019s cricket for nearly a decade.  There is another reason I am grinning so widely. I\u2019ve had the chance to feel like a real citizen after a very long time: work hard, earn a modest income, set aside savings after pitching in with groceries at home, and with some time over the weekend, decently queue and purchase available match tickets to watch the amazing national team play in the city\u2019s stadium. This is my definition of good leisure, an important part of a \u2018good\u2019 life.

She is disappointed by the breaking news that we\u2019re going home, and that she won\u2019t be accompanying my father, khala, sister and me to the match the next day. I find myself promising her that cricket will be back to Pakistan soon, and when it is, I will take her to see every match we can. Does she want to do that? \u201cYes\u201d, she replies solemnly from the back. \u201cDo you know what cricket is?\u201d I ask her. \u201cYes, with the guy swinging on TV,\u201d is how she describes what she\u2019s seen my father and me watching almost every other night all of October. I am a proud aunt in that moment, and I want very much for my niece to grow up in a Pakistan that has its beloved sport back. Cricket in not just Lahore, but any city of Pakistan.

When we hit the road by 4:35pm, we instantly run into a sizeable traffic jam made more problematic by the helpless traffic wardens narrowly avoiding run-ins with fearless motorcyclists. My father has become so unaccustomed to getting to a live cricket match over the past decade that he begins demanding \u2013 to my horror \u2013 that my brother turn the car around and take us all back home to watch the match in peace on TV! I issue calm notes of dissent from the backseat; not only have I spent Rs12,000 on match tickets, I\u2019m tired of yelling victory slogans to the telly, not real players!

They jocularly open a cordoned section of the road, and wave us through, but this restriction is clearly working on cars alone. Motorcyclists are routinely jumping the concrete dividers to escape the chaos unfolding on the opposite side of Usmani Road, and they may or may not have the required match tickets to be accessing this route. The planning is spectacularly mismanaged so far, I have to admit, but from this point it is a two-minute dash to specially designated parking spots within the New Campus. We are so close to the match now, I just giddily laugh at how ridiculous everything looks. \n\nWomen cheer as they arrive to watch the T20 cricket match between Pakistan and Sri Lanka. \u2014AFP\n\n\nLights are strung across anything that won\u2019t move for the next seven hours (or until the Sri Lankans get on their flight home \u2013 who knows how our security strategies are developed?) I see wardens physically picking up, and throwing into the green belts, plastic road dividers that have demonstrated their futility in face of determined Pakistani drivers. Green and white start to colour everything as we get closer to the parking gate, and once inside, we end up in a large field akin to a marriage arrangement \u2013 cars lined up along one end, the other end occupied by hundreds of chairs lined up in neat rows under a traditional wedding canopy. We board a red bus, and watch a conductor yell at a young man to stand up to give his seat to my older lady.

We know this isn\u2019t how getting to a cricket match feels in any other part of the world, but the arrangements within the stadium seem top-notch. I\u2019m worried now my father will run out of patience again, but just in time, we enter through Gate 10 into the Fazal Mahmood enclosure. Against the arriving smog, Gaddafi is gleaming, the field is pristine green, the teams are coming out of the pavilion and we can see the pitch (as well as the stumps) at such a perfect angle, I cannot believe my eyes. * * *The stadium is electric. It is different to the World XI match. This is a real country-on-country contest, our boys in green, theirs in blue. We love the Sri Lankans, but we still want to win. The air is alive with the inexplicable reverie of people who are being rewarded with other people\u2019s faith in their ability to deliver \u2013 not just security arrangements or hospitality, but the swing that takes out an opening batsman or the calm half-century that jacks the run rate up by 12.5%. The ability to deliver on that fundamental cornerstone of the Pakistani identity \u2013 cricket. I feel incredibly fortunate. International cricket hasn\u2019t really been in Pakistan for a decade (barring a Zimbabwean tour, which was also affected by a foiled bomb incident), yet here I am, at my second match since returning to Lahore about three months ago.   \n\nThe Twenty20 against Sri Lanka took less than four hours to play but its significance will last far longer. \u2014AFP\n\n\nThe last time I came to see the World XI was because of sheer luck, and the generosity of one of my former students from Aitchison College with a spare pass into the Chairman\u2019s Box. I\u2019d queued numerous times unsuccessfully to get a match ticket so I was understandably over the moon when the chance came along. Afterwards, at the risk of looking a gift horse in the mouth, I told him I was never going to watch a match from the Box again \u2013 not only was most of the seating behind a wall of glass, the silence inside was eerily reminiscent of a very awkward viewing encounter with a boring old uncle. My student and I ultimately practiced all forms of contortionism, cramped along the floor of the tight balcony outside the Box, watching the match through a white grill. That\u2019s what hunger for live international cricket looks like, I suppose. \n\nMohammad Amir celebrates with team mates after taking the wicket of Dilshan Munaweera. -AP\n\n\nNow, having bounded up the Fazal Mahmood stairs to grab four seats at the top right of the stands, I am the happiest I\u2019ve been in years. This is not an exaggeration. I absolutely love cricket with a passion. If your team is in such form \u2013 and the Pakistani team is \u2013 there is no better treat in the world than to have it perform to its potential in front of your eyes. If your country is 65% young \u2013 and Pakistan is \u2013 live cricket is only improved by the disproportionate presence of young people, and their unrestrained energy. Match report: Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by 2 wickets in second T20Being broadcast live across the world, I know I am standing in the middle of a match that is making history. This is Pakistan telling the whole world it is more than a violent, terrorist maniac seemingly anchored in the South Asian region to singularly serve geostrategic ends. Tonight, we are the persistence of our cricketers; we are the children who have continued to play on Pakistan\u2019s streets when nobody was playing in our stadia; we are the entrepreneurial spirit that has held on to domestic cricket in the vacuum of eight years, and given the world Shadab Khan. \n\nPakistan team poses for photographs with the trophy after winning the T20 series against Sri Lanka. -AFP\n\n\nI will remember this match in different ways forever. I will remember that at about 17 minutes to 6pm, we were around 23,000 people huddled in a protective circle around international cricket at the Gaddafi Stadium, listening to the Sri Lankan anthem, then singing in soulful unison our own. I will remember that as I emerged back into the lights from a toilet break, I saw Amir announce his arrival with his unmistakable reverse swing ruthlessly flinging the bails off of Munaweera\u2019s wicket. I will remember the stadium\u2019s miserable attempts at sustaining a cycle of three waves to \u2018buck up\u2019 Sri Lanka because right in the middle of it, Hassan Ali got to Perera. Match report: Final T20 in Lahore: Pakistan beat Sri Lanka by 36 runs to claim seriesI will remember Imad Wasim turning to us in the stands from deep extra cover, signalling for us to noisily ring in the impending victory.

He said in view of the predicted alarming situation, which Pakistani Punjab witnessed last year, the department had written a letter to the Ministry of Climate Change requesting it to take up the matter of crop stubble burning with India authorities through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. \u201cWe can do this on the pattern of Asean countries which have signed an agreement to tackle smog caused by forest burning in its member countries,\u201d the official said. At present smog in Lahore remains thick in morning. Though it continues to persist throughout the day, in evening smog in the city causes eye and throat irritation. According to EPD and the Met department, people in Lahore are these days facing the same level of smog they had experienced last year due to burning of used tyres by nearly 350 iron and steel-rerolling mills, large scale construction of roads, underpasses and the metro train, and mainly crop stubble burning in Indian Punjab. Official sources, however, claimed that at present smog in the city was 50 per cent less than its recorded level during this season last year. But the situation was going to worsen in the coming days because of dry weather. \u201cRain is not expected in next 15 days, so smog is going to stay,\u201d an official said. An official said that Suparco, the national space agency of Pakistan, had through its satellite caught over 100,000 burning spots in Indian Punjab last year. The actual happening was much intensive because the satellite focuses Punjab just for five minutes thrice a day. The figure recorded on Wednesday was 5,000 and was bound to rise, he said. On its part the department has sealed 100 of the 350 steel factories and ordered every contractor in Lahore to sprinkle water on dirt or cover it with plastic sheets to reduce the level of locally generated pollution.Published in Dawn, November 1st, 2017\n", "title": "Govt urged to take up with India issue of crop stubble burning", "author": "Intikhab Hanif"}, "1366669": {"date": "October 28, 2017", "article": "\n\nThe writer is CEO of LEAD Pakistan, an Islamabad-based think tank specialising in environment and development issues.\n\n\nA NEWLY published report by the Lancet Commission has identified pollution as the biggest environmental cause of disease and premature death in the world. The report claims that almost 22 per cent of premature deaths in Pakistan are attributable to pollution \u2014 and this comes to about 300,000 deaths annually. This is more than the deaths caused by road accidents in the country, or three times the combined toll of tuberculosis, malaria and AIDS. These are stunning findings and have caused a global stir. A 2014 World Bank study, in a similar vein, pointed out that more than 22,600 deaths per year are directly or indirectly attributable to ambient air pollution in Pakistan. \u201cOutdoor air pollution alone causes more than 80,000 hospital admissions per year, nearly 8,000 cases of chronic bronchitis and almost five million cases of lower respiratory\u201d problems among children under five.The urban air pollution levels in Pakistan are amongst the world\u2019s highest, and intensely damaging for human health and quality of life. Pakistan is the most urbanised country in the South Asian region and the direct and indirect costs to our urban, peri-urban and rural standard of life are accelerating. This is degrading our environment, and eroding our economic growth rate. The pollution in low-middle-income countries like Pakistan is estimated to cost 2pc of GDP and almost 7pc of health spending. \nThe urban air pollution levels in Pakistan are amongst the world\u2019s highest.\nTo make things worse, most of this cost is borne by the poor. Marginalised groups, particularly women, children and the elderly, get disproportionately affected. Yet, the commission\u2019s economic analysis does not include the information about the cost of environmental damage caused by pollution, nor does it fully address the challenges and opportunities offered by climate change to address the root causes of pollution.  Despite adverse effects on human health, the pollution issue has traditionally been ignored by the policymaking community in Pakistan. National and provincial assemblies have not enacted any significant legislation to curtail pollution. The manifestos and platforms of political parties are silent about air pollution, industrial emissions, use of chemicals, or technology or fuel import standards. The ambient air quality or industrial emissions standards are inadequate, fragmented and poorly enforced. The capacity of environment protection departments in the provinces has evaporated over the years despite the 18th Amendment that devolved greater environmental responsibilities to them. Their budgets are negligible and enforcement capacities questionable.Pakistan has the highest greenhouse gas emissions intensity in South Asia \u2014 more than India. We emit more GHG emissions per unit of GDP than any other country in the South Asian region. This structural inefficiency adds to the cost of doing business as well as to the national health bill. Worse, Pakistan\u2019s overall trends indicate a steady increase in emissions per unit of economic output over the past few decades. This is expected to further accelerate owing to rapid increase in population, the growing number of mega and intermediate cities, inadequate public transportation and the absence of mass transit systems, heavy reliance on fossil fuels and recent investments in coal-fired power plants. According to the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) document that the federal government submitted to UNFCC Secretariat in 2015, the emissions are projected to more than double during the next decade. If the present trajectory of business as usual (BAU) continues, Pakistan, according to the NDC, will need $40 billion to offset these increases. Add to this the institutional complexity and their standard practice of working in silos. The regulatory agencies and research groups that focus on agendas for environmental health and pollution control operate in two distinct domains. Key sources of pollution-health nexus \u2014 air, water, soil, industry and chemicals \u2014 are regulated by different national and provincial agencies. This often results in competing policies, interests and fragmented understanding of the full scale of pollution and its share in the national burden of disease. The Lancet Commission report has provided a unique opportunity to our national, provincial and city governments to give deeper thought to how best to change this state of affairs.  Going forward, our commitment to Agenda 2030, also known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), provides a window of opportunity to curtail pollution over the next 15 years. Robust and long-term programmes to protect the health and lives of people through national pollution-control programmes are needed at the federal and provincial levels. The prime minister needs to set up an inter-ministerial commission to design and deliver Pakistan\u2019s pollution management programme. A series of targeted, well-integrated interventions should reach out to millions of Pakistanis through pollution-monitoring networks in the provinces, a consolidated regulatory framework for pollution control and using command-and-control measures that include ambient air standards, emissions standards and technology standards. For this to happen, the government must: a) link air quality to health indicators by focusing on reducing pollutants linked to higher morbidity and mortality, particularly fine particulate matter, sulphur dioxide and lead content that are several times higher than WHO air quality guidelines; and b) link with cleaner production by focusing in particular on such industries as cement, fertiliser, sugar, steel and power plants, and on brick kilns, plastic moulding, and other waste-burning industries.Curtailing pollution is essential for meeting the following SDGs: SDG-1 (poverty alleviation), SDG-3 (improving health), SDG-6 (access to clean water and sanitation), SDG-10 (promoting social justice), SDG-11 (building sustainable cities and communities), SDG-13 (climate change) and SDG-14 and 15 (protecting land and water). Their successful implementation will help curtail pollution that disproportionately kills the poor and vulnerable. Pollution control can benefit greatly from efforts to decarbonise economic development and mainstream renewable energy to slow the pace of climate change in Pakistan.The writer is CEO of LEAD Pakistan, an Islamabad-based think tank specialising in environment and development issues.Published in Dawn, October 28th, 2017\n", "title": "Kill pollution, save lives", "author": "Ali Tauqeer Sheikh"}, "1365211": {"date": "October 21, 2017", "article": "ISTANBUL: With focus on upgrading its communications and energy infrastructure and enhancing regional connectivity under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Pakistan on Friday sought enhanced trade and economic partnerships with D-8 member states through stronger rail, road, air and sea links. Representing Pakistan at the ninth summit of the Developing Eight Organisation for Economic Cooperation (D-8), Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi urged the members to focus on project implementation for development, progress and prosperity of the people. The ninth summit, hosted by Turkey, adopted the Istanbul Declaration 2017 and the D-8 Istanbul Plan of Action, reaffirming the group\u2019s commitments to establish peace, democracy, and solidarity among the member states. In the declaration, the D-8 leadership took stock of progress in various fields,  including energy and economy, while expressing mutual hope that implementation of development projects and programmes would make the partnership visible and tangible to the people of the member states. On the occasion, Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi handed over chairmanship of the organisation to Turkey. Addressing the opening session of the summit, Prime Minister Abbasi said Pakistan assumed the chair of the organisation in November 2012 at the eighth summit in Islamabad, which adopted two landmark documents \u2014 the D-8 Charter and the Global Vision. The documents provided the essential basis for joint endeavours, he added. The summit, whose theme was \u2018Expanding Opportunities through Cooperation\u2019, was attended by Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari, Azerbaijani leader Ilham Aliyev, Iran\u2019s first vice president Eshaq Jahangiri and the vice president of Indonesia, Jusuf Kalla. Pakistan, Mr Abbasi said, made every effort to proactively lead the group towards realisation of its objectives and vision. \u201cIt was a privilege for us to host the summit meeting, two sessions of the council and four sessions of the D-8 commission as well as a number of sectoral meetings since November 2012,\u201d he added. The premier said Pakistan was celebrating 70 years of its independence and had confronted many challenges over the last decade. \u201cWe faced unrelenting terrorism emanating from instability in our neighbourhood and the environment in the region and beyond,\u201d he said, stressing that as a result of a comprehensive strategy and unwavering resolve, the country successfully turned the tide. Prime Minister Abbasi said CPEC would further put Pakistan\u2019s economy on an upward trajectory of robust growth. \u201cPakistan\u2019s integration into the Eurasian Belt and road network will provide a firm foundation for [its] rapid economic development,\u201d he added. In his address, Mr Abbasi pointed towards the stagnation of intra-D-8 trade, after an initial increase, saying the apprehension that the target of $500 billion in 2018 \u2014 envisaged in the 2008 Kuala Lumpur Summit Roadmap \u2014 might remain elusive. \u201cIt is, therefore, important for us to implement various instruments and agreements aimed at facilitating trade amongst member states, especially those related to preferential trade, small and medium enterprises, customs, simplification of visa matters and civil aviation,\u201d he added. Sectoral meetings at the ministerial level had already chalked out the roadmaps, and now was the time for implementation, the premier urged the members. On the occasion, Mr Abbasi expressed gratitude for the hospitality extended by the Turkish leadership to the Pakistan delegation since their arrival. President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdogan also addressed the opening session of the summit and spoke on various challenges faced by the Muslim world in general and the member states in particular.Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2017\n", "title": "Pakistan seeks trade, economic partnership with D-8 countries", "author": "Agencies"}, "1363066": {"date": "Updated October 11, 2017", "article": "WASHINGTON: The number of US airstrikes in Afghanistan hit a seven-year high in September as the military acted on President Donald Trump\u2019s new strategy for the country, the US Air Forces Central Command reported on Tuesday.US forces dropped 751 bombs against the Taliban and the Islamic State (IS) targets in Afghanistan last month, an increase of 50 per cent from the 503 dropped in August and the most since the Battle of Sangin in late 2010, when more than 100 US and British troops were killed while fighting the Taliban.\u201cThis increase can be attributed to the president\u2019s strategy to more proactively target extremist groups that threaten the stability and security of the Afghan people,\u201d the report said. \u201cAdditionally, the recent addition of six F-16s at Bagram Air Base, coupled with more B-52 missions dedicated to Afghanistan, offer the additional strike capacity needed to target these groups.\u201dSince 2010, the highest number of bombs dropped in a month in Afghanistan by the US military was 589 in August 2012, still over 150 less than September 2017.The US has so far dropped a total 3,238 bombs in Afghanistan this year, more than two times the 1,337 dropped the year before.As part of the new US strategy, Washington is also trying to build up Afghanistan\u2019s nascent airpower capabilities.

But this has not been addressed properly as the level of education in our society is very low. Education plays a vital role in enhancing the mental abilities. The modern world\u2019s requirements are much greater than what conventional education provides. Our youth desperately needs to be de-radicalised and become visionary and liberal. But how is this to be achieved? Pakistan has limited resources when it comes to youth development programmes. Good strategies can bring better results, not merely the opening of more schools. Our schoolteachers, especially in the rural areas, teach only how to read or write, or how to calculate. This is just basic education, that too of a poor standard. Teachers are untrained, mostly closed-minded, radicalised, and even extremist.I firmly believe that we can utilise our electronic media with the help of the ministry of education, Pemra, universities and scientific research institutes. We have TV sets in almost every household. Different channels air lots of programmes. Drama serials are viewed by the largest number of households. But they only portray only in-law, marriage and divorce issues, or beautiful faces and fashion. This is not helping our youth in any way. The education ministry, with the help Pemra, must make it mandatory for every channel to devote 60 or 90 minutes of airtime every day to educational programmes. Further, the ministry can launch its own channel to promote intellectual curiosity.These channels, with the help of university faculties and students, can air programmes that open up our youth\u2019s mind. Interactive and interesting lectures and workshops must be televised.

The US has alleged that terrorist sanctuaries exist on Pakistani territory from where the insurgency in Afghanistan is being sustained. Mr Tillerson, during his visit to Pakistan, said that relationship with Pakistan would be conditional in terms of whether or not it acted on the \u201cspecific requests\u201d from US President Donald Trump\u2019s administration. \u201cWe have extended to Pakistan certain expectations we have of their government and their leadership to deal with, in particular these organisations, the leaders of these organisations \u2026action to be taken to begin to deny these organisations the ability to launch attacks against others,\u201d Mr Tillerson told journalists in Delhi. On Wednesday, Mr Asif told the Senate that Pakistan received a list of 75 wanted terrorists \u2014mostly belonging to the Haqqani network \u2014 from the US. At the committee meeting, the foreign minister, alluding to the decline in the number of drone atta\u00adcks in Pakistani areas, said it was not because the US had run out of missiles, but because there wasn\u2019t much here for them to target. Makhdum Khusro Bakhtyar, the new chairman of foreign affairs committee, observed that it was a moment of truth for the US in Afghanistan and urged the Trump administration not to turn the differences into disputes. He noted that Pakistan\u2019s response to President Trump\u2019s South Asian policy had been collective, measured and based on realistic assessment of the situation. Mr Bakhtyar, who has previously remained the minister of state for foreign affairs, emphasised the importance of engaging the US in promoting peace in Afghanistan. He expressed the hope that the US would stop seeing Pakistan through the Afghan prism and instead work on a broad-based relationship which would benefit both countries.

Except that on a recent day in August, not a leaf is stirring. The ride on a road that branches off Karachi Thatta National Highway and leads to Pakistan Steel Mills is as suffocating as it is bumpy.Right where the road enters the vast premises of Pakistan Steel Mills, a verse from the Quran is displayed on a billboard: \u201cAnd we have sent down iron, wherein is great military might and benefits for the people.\u201d A few feet away, close to 25 men can be seen sitting under a shamiana \u2014 they have been staging a sit-in here since August 3, 2016.Right next to them is the Mills\u2019 main entrance, named after Muhammad Ali Jinnah. Behind it lies 19,000 acres of land that houses various constituent parts of Pakistan Steel Mills: 20 different plants, including a thermal power station, forklifts, warehouses, conveyor belts, railway tracks, stockyards.Dozens of industries, including vehicle manufacturing factories and a steel mill, are located on a part of the same land. They were originally meant to draw their raw materials from Pakistan Steel Mills. \nNo machines whir, no plants hum, no furnaces radiate inside the Mills.All 20 of its processing plants are shut. In an area fenced off to block entry without permission, 5,000 tonnes of rusted metal sits untouched \u2014 or so it seems. This was produced when the plants were running. \nOperational furnaces produced so much heat that no one could walk\nunderneath them without protective gear. Now, they look like museum\npieces.\nAn insulated two-way conveyor belt \u2013 about 4.5 kilometres long \u2013 appears to be in perfect shape, even though it has not moved an inch for over a year. It used to carry raw material such as coal and iron ore from the docks at nearby Port Qasim and transported manufactured goods to the port. Its insulation ensured that those materials were not exposed to the elements and their surface temperature was maintained at a desirable level \u2014 a marvel of technology and architecture. Also read: Is privatisation the solution to Pakistan's financial problems?Large deposits of iron ore lie in an open yard. Amidst them sits a giant Soviet-era forklift. It is under maintenance. A similar contraption in the empty coal yard looks like it is still in the middle of finishing its last task. These machines are capable of shifting 1,000 tonnes of coal or iron ore in one hour from the yards to the conveyor belt that then carries them to different plants. Something written in Cyrillic script appears right on top of them. When these machines were operational, they kicked up a storm of dust so thick that no one could see them from a distance.Twelve railway coaches are parked inside a wagon shop. They once fetched molten iron ore from one part of the Mills to another. They are regularly maintained and can be put back to work at short notice. Two blast furnaces at the Iron-Making Department stand idly, held steady by their frames. The giant ladles that once shifted processed iron ore from the furnaces onto the railway coaches stand motionless and empty \u2014 like the outstretched hands of a beggar.\n\nInside Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nThe smell of gas that once fuelled the furnaces still pervades the environs. Insulation around the pipes that carried gas, compressed air and water to the furnaces is coming off. When the department was functional, this insulation required continuous maintenance. Operational furnaces produced so much heat that no one could walk underneath them without protective gear. Now, they look like museum pieces, with onlookers inspecting them from all possible angles, without the fear of any hazard or harm.    Also read: Plane truths\u2014How costly is it to keep PIA flying?The Mills has an integrated structure. All its plants and machines work in tandem. If one of its parts closes down, the rest also comes to a standstill. When the Mills shut down on June 10, 2015, it was not the result of any of its parts going out of order and gradually closing down the rest of the production process. Instead, all the plants and machines were shut down abruptly, at once.It was, however, not entirely unexpected. The Sui Southern Gas Company (SSGC), that supplied natural gas to the Mills, had been demanding that its bills of nearly 35 billion rupees be cleared. After sending a final notice to the management of Pakistan Steel Mills early last summer, SSGC cut off the gas supply, bringing Pakistan\u2019s largest steel producer to a sudden halt.  An eerie silence surrounds Pakistan Steel Mills today. Its machines and plants \u2013 that have the capacity to produce close to 1.1 million tonnes of steel in a year \u2013 run the risk of becoming permanently dysfunctional if they do not start running again soon. The longer they remain turned off, the costlier it will be to reboot them. \n\nThe master plan for Karachi Steel Mill Township\n\n\nManagement officials at Pakistan Steel Mills are waiting for a miracle that sets it rolling again. \nThey are waiting for an injection of money from the federal government to pay outstanding salaries and other dues of former and working members of the staff. They are waiting for a missive from the Privatisation Commission. They were told that the financial adviser appointed by the commission to supervise the sale of the Mills to some private buyer would soon contact them. Many weeks have passed since that information reached them, but they have not received a single phone call or a letter with the latest updates. They are not even sure if privatisation will ever go ahead, at all. This \u2018nothing happens\u2019 state of affairs did not develop overnight. It has been almost 20 years in the making. On May 29, 1997, the Council of Common Interest (CCI) approved the Mills\u2019 privatisation because, according to a petition filed at the Supreme Court, \u201cit could not prove to be a commercially viable project\u201d. Immediately after the approval, however, the government started having second thoughts. It dropped the idea of privatisation and, instead, decided to reform the Mills\u2019 financial and management structures to make it profitable. The restructuring was made possible by hefty injections of money (secured by the government as loans). The move worked and the Mills started earning profit 2002 onwards. Also read: Gridlocked\u2014How power is lost in Pakistan's distribution linesAudited accounts confirm the improvement. In 1999-2000, the Mills made an annual loss of 1.141 billion rupees, taking its total accumulated losses to 9.326 billion rupees. By 2005, the accumulated losses were all gone. On the other hand, the Mills had an accumulated profit of 4.866 billion rupees.The production capacity also increased in that period: from 76 per cent in 1999-2000 to 86 per cent (in 2000-2001); 81 per cent (in 2001-2002); 92 per cent (in 2002-2003); 94 per cent (in 2003-2004) and 89 per cent (in 2004-2005). \nManagement officials at Pakistan Steel Mills are waiting for a miracle\nthat sets it rolling again.\nOn April 11, 2005, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation again decided to privatise Pakistan Steel Mills. In light of this decision, the government published newspaper advertisements, inviting Expressions of Interest from parties interested in acquiring the Mills. Sometime later, 19 parties applied, seeking approval for their qualification to partake in the privatisation process. These included Al-Tuwairqi Group (Saudi Arabia), in partnership with Arif Habib Group (Pakistan), and Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works (Russia). During this time, the government appointed Citi Group as the financial adviser to evaluate the assets of Pakistan Steel Mills. The adviser submitted its evaluation report to the Privatisation Commission, which deliberated upon it and also took into consideration the replacement cost of some of the machinery. The commission then suggested that the total worth of the Mills stood at 500 million dollars. \n\nA man makes his way down from one of the blast furnaces at Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nBased on this calculation, the price for 75 per cent stake in the Mills was put at 375 million dollars. Since one US dollar at the time was equal to 60 rupees, the price of a single share in local currency was calculated to be 17.43 rupees (the total number of shares being privatised was 1,290,487,275).When the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation went through these statistics, it revised the shared price downwards at 16.18 rupees. The Arif Habib Group and Al-Tuwairqi Group \u2013 two of the parties the government qualified to take part in the privatisation process \u2013 formed a consortium to offer a joint bid for the purchase of shares. Magnitogorsk Iron and Steel Works also joined the consortium on the day the bids were to be made. This consortium, according to the petition filed at the Supreme Court, offered to pay 16.80 rupees per share, a price higher than those offered by their competitors. The government accepted the offer and issued a letter of acceptance on March 31, 2006. The successful bidders signed an agreement with the government representatives on April 24, 2006. They were all set to take over the Mills. Except that it never happened.    Days before the letter of acceptance was issued, a little-known group, Wattan Party, and Peoples Workers Union (the elected trade union representative of the Mills\u2019 workers at the time) challenged the privatisation before the Sindh High Court in Karachi. The petition claimed that there were \u201comissions\u201d during the privatisation process and that the Mills was being sold at a \u201cthrowaway\u201d price of 21.68 billion rupees. Also read: Mass movement\u2014Karachi's public transport woesThe Sindh High Court referred the petition to the Supreme Court on March 30, 2006. The apex court examined the privatisation process over the next few weeks and declared the letter of acceptance as null and void on June 23, 2006. This was the first time, according to Mohammad Zubair, the current head of the Privatisation Commission, that the privatisation process of a government-owned entity was completed and then reversed by the Supreme Court. When Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, the chief justice of Pakistan at the time, took the decision against the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills, it seemed like a victory for the workers. Later, events would suggest that it was a pyrrhic one.Zubair says 2006 was the best time to privatise the Mills. Today, it is in the worst possible shape, he says, making its privatisation a very slow process, with little interest being shown by prospective buyers. The Mills, for instance, ran at only six per cent of its production capacity between 2013 and 2014. Its accumulated losses reached 118.529 billion rupees by the end of the 2013-2014 financial year. In that year alone, the Mills made a net loss of 23.532 billion rupees.\n\nA Soviet built machine at Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nThe rot started much before 2014. Many blame it on the way the federal government of the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) \u2013 that came to power in the first half of 2008 \u2013 handled Pakistan Steel Mills. That year, the government appointed a new chairman, Moin Aftab Sheikh, to head the Mills\u2019 management. The same year, election for the Collective Bargaining Agency (CBA) \u2013 empowered to bargain with the management on the workers\u2019 behalf \u2013 were held. Peoples Workers Union, a labour organisation of the Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 workers affiliated to PPP, won that election. The combined impact of a PPP-appointed chairman and the victory of its affiliated union as CBA was far from benign. The two sides, instead of keeping an eye on each other as they ideally should, seemingly joined hands to the detriment of the Mills. The alleged collaboration between the chairman and the CBA has been recorded in a corruption case registered in 2010. The case was in \u201crespect of award of Canteen contract wherein it is alleged that Mr Moin Aftab Sheikh\u2026in connivance with other accused persons fraudulently scrapped the already floated tender.\u201d This, according to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), caused a loss of 81.041 million rupees. One of the co-accused in this case is Shamshad Qureshi, the chairman of the CBA. Even otherwise, Sheikh\u2019s tenure was extremely controversial. All kinds of allegations swirled around him. In 2009, a case was registered against him and three others for causing a loss of 49 million rupees to the Mills. He was alleged to have \u201cfraudulently manipulated a spot purchase of 50,000 [metric tonnes] of coal\u201d from Australia \u201con highly-inflated price and on extremely higher freight rates despite declining market rate.\u201d \nThe combined impact of a PPP-appointed chairman and the victory of its\naffiliated union as CBA was far from benign.\nThe same year, Sheikh, along with a few others, was booked in another case. This pertained to the \u201cmanipulation\u201d in the acceptance of 40,000 metric tonnes of metallurgical coke, which \u201carrived from China \u2026 without opening of [Letter of Credit] or obtaining necessary permission \u2026 on highly-inflated price and on extremely high freight rates resulting in loss of 1 billion rupees\u2026\u201d Again, in 2009, he was among those who had allegedly manipulated \u201c10 shipments of coal\u201d from Australia and Canada on a \u201chighly-inflated price and extremely high freight rates, causing loss of billions of rupees\u201d. In a case registered in 2010, Sheikh was among 13 individuals who had caused \u201cwrongful loss\u201d to the public exchequer \u201cto the tune of millions of rupees regarding the sale and purchase of various finished products, including billets\". A 2012 case accused him and 26 others of collusion that \u201ccaused wrongful loss\u201d to Pakistan Steel Mills in \u201csale/purchase of various finished products\u201d.  Sheikh\u2019s alleged involvement in large-scale corruption also allowed his subordinates to pocket public money at will. In one of the four other major cases of corruption pertaining to his tenure, the senior management staff at the Mills caused a loss of 3.65 billion rupees by selling 49,000 metric tonnes of steel billets below market prices. In the second case, senior members of the management \u201cextended illegal benefit of 90 days free credit without mark-up to Amrelli Steels Limited\u201d in Karachi. The third one was regarding the violation of Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 rules (which state that the same company cannot be a trader and a consumer dealer) by two traders who, in connivance with the Mills\u2019 management, sold products they had purchased as consumer dealers in the open market. The last case makes the same allegation against the representatives of Gujrat Steel Private Limited who sold products they had purchased from Pakistan Steel Mills for four of their registered consumers. Their main accomplice from among the management was one Ghafoor Pathan,  who worked as deputy manager of Customer Service Marketing at the time. \n\nPakistan Steel Mills workers head home after their day shift\n\n\nThese cases were registered after the Supreme Court took suo motu notice of the allegations of corruption at Pakistan Steel Mills. The court directed the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) to investigate those allegations. The public furor over stories of corruption in the Mills led the then Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani to sack Sheikh on August 18, 2009. Those responsible for investigating plunder at Pakistan Steel Mills, however, have failed to move briskly enough to ensure the prosecution and conviction of those involved. Three years after the Supreme Court gave the FIA the task of investigation, the judges became unhappy with the agency\u2019s progress. \u201cWe do not find any serious effort on the part of the FIA towards prosecution of the cases,\u201d they declared. In 2012, they handed over the investigation to the National Accountability Bureau (NAB), which, too, has failed to achieve any results. While forwarding the cases to the NAB, the Supreme Court had ordered it to take action within three months. More than three years later, that order exists more in disregard than in compliance. In June of this year, the Ministry of Industries and Production in Islamabad sent a letter to the NAB, calling for the \u201clatest/updated compliance report for the cases \u2026 pending with NAB.\u201d The letter has elicited no response so far. Even when anti-corruption institutions have failed to bring the corrupt to justice, the data vividly paints the disaster their activities wreaked on the Mills. In the financial years 2006-2007 and 2007-2008, it was running at a capacity of 82 per cent and 89 per cent, respectively. Its net annual profit stood at 3.159 billion rupees in 2006-2007 and at 2.081 billion rupees in 2007-2008. In the following year, there was a massive reduction in its production capacity, which fell to 65 per cent. The Mills incurred a loss of 26.526 billion rupees in 2008-2009. \nWhile forwarding the cases to the NAB, the Supreme Court had ordered\nit to take action within three months. More than three years later,\nthat order exists more in disregard than in compliance.\nAvais Hyder Liaquat Nauman, an audit firm that the Mills\u2019 management engaged on the orders of the Supreme Court to gauge the impact of Sheikh\u2019s tenure, made startling revelations: Pakistan Steel Mills suffered a loss of 9.99 billion rupees due to corrupt practices in that year; mismanagement and negligence caused a loss of 11.84 billion rupees; and business losses stood at 4.68 billion rupees. If Pakistan Steel Mills had not lost those 26.526 billion rupees under Sheikh, that money could have been sufficient to pay around 2.04 million rupees to each of the Mills\u2019 13,000 employees awaiting salaries. But even after Sheikh had left, the situation at the Mills went from bad to worse. Between August 2009 and July 2013, five people successively served as chairman of Pakistan Steel Mills \u2014 three of them held that position only in an acting position or as an additional charge. That, obviously, had a negative impact on the working of the Mills.In 2009-2010, its production capacity dropped to 40 per cent; in 2010-2011, it fell further to 36 per cent. By the end of 2012-2013, it had dipped to as low as 14 per cent. The Mills\u2019 accumulated losses at the time stood at a massive 94.997 billion rupees. In a span of only six years, between 2007 and 2013, the Mills not only eroded its previously accumulated profit of 9.536 billion rupees, but also added almost 10 times as much money in losses. That means that the total money Pakistan Steel Mills lost in this period stood at a staggering 104.533 billion rupees. With that kind of money, one can buy 5,226 two-bedroom apartments in a posh neighbourhood in Karachi, each costing 20 million rupees. \n\nThe iron making department inside Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif decided to resume the process of Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 privatisation in October 2013. It was included among 69 state-owned enterprises that the government wanted to sell to the private sector. Over the next three years or so, however, the Mills\u2019 privatisation made little progress. There were hurdles at every stage. Even the task of finding a financial adviser was not smooth. When the Privatisation Commission advertised in the press that it needed a financial adviser for the privatisation of Pakistan Steel Mills, no one came forward in the 30-day time frame given in the advert.The Privatisation Commission issued another ad after three months or so. Finally, towards the end of 2014, one consortium \u2013 comprising the Pak-China Investment Bank, the auditing firm PricewaterhouseCoopers and human resource consultancy Abacus \u2013 came forward. Even though the consortium is not the best adviser that the Mills should get, the commission \u2013 according to Zubair \u2013 had no choice. Another challenge for the Privatisation Commission was to make the Mills an attractive business for prospective buyers. Zubair decided to ask the federal government to inject 18.5 billion rupees into the Mills to improve its operational and financial status.When he took his plan to the Economic Coordination Committee of the federal cabinet in April 2014, he explained that his goal was to raise the production capacity from zero to 60 per cent (estimated to cost nine billion rupees) and pay the long-overdue utility bills and outstanding staff salaries (estimated to cost 9.5 billion rupees). His objective was to keep the Mills in working condition until the privatisation process was completed. The committee approved his plan.\nPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif decided to resume the process of Pakistan\nSteel Mills\u2019 privatisation in October 2013.\nIt also worked \u2014 at least initially. The production capacity did pick up and reached close to 60 per cent by early 2015.A few weeks later, came the biggest hurdle: disconnection of the gas supply shut down the Mills completely. Zubair and his Privatisation Commission have been unable to overcome that hurdle so far.He took another route to bypass it. The Privatisation Commission organised roadshows in September 2015 in Beijing and Shanghai to attract foreign buyers for Pakistan Steel Mills. Many Chinese companies showed conditional interest. The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation also approved the structure of the privatisation transaction on October 1, 2015, showing what assets were to be privatised and how many liabilities were to be transferred to the private buyer. While these developments were taking place, the government of Sindh showed interest in acquiring Pakistan Steel Mills. The Cabinet Committee on Privatisation directed the Privatization Commission to formally approach the provincial government to see if it was interested in acquiring the Mills with all its assets and liabilities. By the end of April 2016, the Sindh government said it was no longer interested. It said the federal government was not willing to provide even those financial incentives that any private buyer would have gotten anyway. A report published in the daily Business Recorder said that the Sindh government had sought financial assistance from the federal government, but the latter denied that request and told the former to buy the Mills on an \u201cas is, where is\u201d basis. For the next few months, the privatisation process was completely stalled. In June this year, the Cabinet Committee on Privatisation again authorised the Privatisation Commission to restart the process. A meeting was held in Islamabad on September 21, 2016, to finalise a new transaction structure. \u201cWe will go back to the cabinet committee for the approval of [the] transaction structure in a couple of weeks,\u201d says Zubair. Also read: Harvesting losses- Behind the trouble on Punjab's rice farmsThat approval will face many roadblocks. Firstly, losses are piling up, and so are the liabilities. Secondly, Zubair says, the interest shown by Chinese companies is no longer as strong as it was last year, when eight of them were ready to take part in the privatisation process. Now,  only three to four of them are willing to do so. Thirdly, frustration among the employees of Pakistan Steel Mills is growing by the day over non-payment of their salaries and other dues. They want to get their money back before the Mills is privatised. Zubair knows all this. Even the highest bid will be nothing compared to what was offered in 2006, he says. \u201c[The Mills] is non-functional and it owes 66 billion rupees to the National Bank of Pakistan and 40 billion rupees to the Sui Southern Gas Company,\u201d he says. Whoever buys the Mills, their ability to borrow money from banks will be limited because of this credit history, he adds. Zubair also argues it will be a wise move to sell the Mills at whatever price it attracts. That will, at least, ensure the resumption of its operations, he says. The first benefit of an operational Mills will be that money being given to it as a subsidy from the public exchequer will no longer be required. Secondly, the new owners will invest money to upgrade plants and machines. Thirdly, an operational Mills will absorb 8,000 to 9,000 of its existing employees, if not all of them. \u201cWe will at least save it from complete shut down,\u201d Zubair says, considering the government does not have the resources to restart its operations.  \n\nThe coke oven plant inside Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nPakistan Steel Mills has not paid salaries to its staffers since May 2016. It has not paid gratuity to its former employees who have retired since May 2013 and it has failed to give provident fund to retiring staffers since 2015 (the total number of employees in these two categories is 3,000, according to a trade unionist). The Mills\u2019 total losses and liabilities, according to one source, stand at 400 billion rupees. Its management acknowledges it is losing seven million rupees per day, even when all its plants and machines are shut down and its staffers are not being paid. The Mills\u2019 accumulated losses and liabilities are more than 150 per cent of the total expenditure on setting it up back in 1974. That expenditure was recorded at 25 billion rupees. That money is equivalent to 2.52 billion dollars (considering that the dollar was equivalent to 9.9 rupees in 1974). In today\u2019s dollar prices, the Mills\u2019 construction cost would be 264.6 billion rupees even by conservative estimates. Back in the day, Pakistan Steel Mills was the \u201cbackbone of the nation\u201d. At its official inauguration ceremony on January 15, 1985, General Ziaul Haq said it was \u201cthe greatest and most precious new year gift to the nation\u201d. Lieutenant General Saeed Qadir, then federal minister for production, declared the Mills as a \u201cmilestone on the road of economic freedom, all-around progress and national honour\u201d. Also read: Ziaul Haq\u2014Master of illusionAt the ceremony, Vitali S Smirnov, the Soviet Union\u2019s ambassador to Pakistan at the time, said that the Mills would become a symbol of friendship between the two states. The entire funding for setting up the Mills came from the Soviet Union \u2014 some in the form of cash for constructing the buildings, roads, railtracks, conveyor belts, etc, and the rest in the form of finished products. After the ceremony, Haq spoke to reporters and claimed that the Soviet Union had offered to set up a second steel mill in Pakistan. \u201cWe welcome this gesture and will consider it at the right time,\u201d he said. The irony is that Pakistan, at the time, was also waging a proxy war in Afghanistan against the Soviet Union. \n\nMetal scrap at the scrapyard inside Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nSometime in the 1950s, Ghulam Faruque, a senior bureaucrat, established the Pakistan Industrial Development Corporation (PIDC) with the objective of promoting industrialisation, both in the public and private sectors. His corporations would arrange money and technology for prospective investors. One of its earlier projects was building a steel mill because it was considered essential for the industrialisation of the country, says Haq Nawaz Akhtar, one of the first chairmen of Pakistan Steel Mills. The project was first proposed in the first five-year plan (1955 -1960), according to the Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 website. By 1956, Pakistan had received a proposal from the Soviet Union, offering technical and economic assistance to build the proposed steel mill, says a report by the Area Study Centre, a university-based think tank in Peshawar. In April 1965, President Ayub Khan visited Moscow. Subsequently, his government decided to set up a steel mill in the public sector. By July 2, 1968, reads an entry on the Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 website, \u201cPakistan Steel Mills Corporation was set up as a \u2026 company in the public sector in accordance [with] the Companies Act of 1913, with the objective to establish and run steel mills [in] Karachi and other parts of Pakistan.\u201d The following year in January, the corporation finalised an agreement with Tiajproexport, a company in the Soviet Union, \u201cfor the preparation of a feasibility report into the establishment\u201d of a steel mill. \nA couple of months later, Ayub Khan had to resign. \nThe interest shown by Chinese companies is no longer as strong as it\nwas last year, when eight of them were ready to take part in the\nprivatisation process.\nWhen Zulfikar Ali Bhutto became prime minister, he decided to set up the steel mill at its current location. He also approved the construction of Port Muhammad Bin Qasim, dedicated to fulfil the proposed mills\u2019 logistic requirements. Between 1972 and 1977, Bhutto visited Moscow twice. As pointed out by the Area Study Centre, there was an \u201cimprovement in economic and scientific relations\u201d between the two countries. In 1973, a number of Soviet economic delegations and steel experts visited Pakistan. On December 30 that year, Bhutto laid the foundation stone for Pakistan Steel Mills.  By the early 1990s, however, the Mills was already showing  signs of sluggish performance. Sabeeh Qamaruz Zaman was a serving lieutenant general at the time. He took over as the chairman of Pakistan Steel Mills in January 1992 and immediately embarked on a plan to cut costs. His first savings were in \u201covertime, incentive, medical, transport, financial expense and consumption of stores,\u201d according to a 1994 article written by defence and political analyst Ikram Sehgal and published in The Nation, a daily newspaper. Within 18 months of taking up his job, Zaman was able to bring down the total expenses from 223 million rupees to 165 million rupees per month. The medical expenses of employees would amount to 30 million rupees a month at the time, says a knowledgeable source. Some workers were applying for the reimbursement of their medical expenses, which were up to 25,000 rupees. Zaman set up a committee to address the issue: anyone who needed more than 5,000 rupees in medical expenses had to appear before the committee and justify the expense. The committee discovered that some employees were seeking reimbursement for money spent on cosmetics, house-building and repairing and other non-medical expenses. Within two months, the medical expenses dropped down to 10 million rupees.  \n\nSoviet built machinery at Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nAfter his retirement from the army, Zaman became one of the founding directors of The Citizens Foundation. He is now running a non-profit organisation for girls, Quality School Foundation, and lives a quiet life with his wife, children and grandchildren in Rawalpindi.Zaman managed to run the Mills in 1994, at its highest ever production capacity of 95 per cent, producing 1.04 million tonnes of steel in that year. In order to make that happen, he had to fight the unions, the Russian staff and even the government. He took on the Russians when they did not cooperate with him. After a Russian engineer declared a machine dead and demanded new machinery be bought from Russia, Zaman urged Pakistani engineers to rise up to the occasion and put the machine back to work. They passed the test with flying colours. He then told the Russian engineers to pack up and leave as they were no longer needed. Hundreds of them left as a result of his orders. These days only a handful of Russian engineers work at Pakistan Steel Mills. His next target were workers affiliated with political parties.  In the early 1990s, the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) had 15 registered trade unions in Pakistan Steel Mills and a total of 600 labour activists. They considered themselves exempt from work, but got salaries and overtime regularly, along with other benefits, Sehgal wrote. Zaman also discovered that 3,800 of the Mills\u2019 employees existed only on paper. They never came to work. He immediately removed them from the payroll. It was later discovered that their salaries went directly to Nine Zero, MQM\u2019s headquarters in Karachi, says a source, without wanting to be named.  Incensed by his move, MQM threatened to close down the Mills as well as the city of Karachi. Under pressure from the party, Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif called Zaman for a meeting and tried to convince him to take those people back on the payroll. Zaman refused to undo what he had done. He told the prime minister that he could sack him if he liked. Sharif, instead, decided to form a committee to tackle the situation. Before this committee could even begin its work, the government started a security operation against MQM in Karachi. Zaman never had to worry about the issue any more. \u201cI stopped all outside interference by the labour unions, government and political parties,\u201d he says, in an interview conducted in his home. \u201cAll decisions were made in-house, in the interest of Pakistan Steel Mills and not in the interest of anybody outside,\u201d adds Zaman. \n\nAn employee sits in his two bedroom house inside Karachi Steel Mill Township\n\n\nNaureen Farooq remembers the good old days fondly. A native of Faisalabad, she joined Pakistan Steel Mills as a volunteer in its education department in 1985. The schools within the area where Pakistan Steel Mills\u2019 workers lived were only up to the primary level at the time and were not in the best of conditions. In 1987, the management set up a committee to improve the quality of education. As recommended by the committee, the management gave full-time jobs to all those working as volunteers like Farooq. That gave a big fillip to educational activities.  Today, there are 21 educational institutions in the residential part of the Mills. These include primary schools, Sindhi medium schools, degree colleges and a cadet college. There are more than 5,000 children enrolled at these institutions. Farooq has albums containing photographs from her time as a teacher. In many of them, she can be seen standing confidently next to her colleagues and the Mills\u2019 management. Many pictures show annual school functions, stage performances by students, visits by Chinese delegations, sports events \u2014 and greener, brighter residential blocks. \u201cPeople keep complaining about what has happened to Pakistan Steel Mills,\u201d says Farooq, \u201cbut they never ask what part they have played in it.\u201d An industry does not reach point zero overnight, she adds.Farooq recalls how Muhammad Afzal, who worked as the Mills\u2019 chairman until his untimely death in 2003, once gathered all the employees of the education department and informed them that Pakistan Steel Mills was no longer running in losses. \u201cYou can proudly call yourselves the employees of Pakistan Steel Mills, because we have finally paid off all our debts,\u201d she quotes him as saying. \n\nThe Russian market inside Karachi Steel Mill Township\n\n\nInside Karachi Steel Mill Township, a residential neighbourhood built exclusively to house the Mills\u2019 staff, pride in the institution is the last thing one expects. Not a leaf rustles here on a suffocating August day. The streets that divide the workers\u2019 colony from the officers\u2019 residences are deserted \u2014 in tandem with the stillness at the nearby premises of the Mills. Built on approximately 715 acres of land, the township has 3,700 houses. It has its own schools, markets, recreational facilities, a dispensary, a mosque, a church and a temple. Many of the Mills\u2019 existing and former employees live here. The officers\u2019 residences that dot the streets all look the same: plain, concrete blocks with two floors, each marked by circular windows. Most have unkempt lawns. The paint on their walls is wearing off. In the workers\u2019 colony, houses are smaller. Some do not even have doors; curtains made of discarded bed sheets block off their entrances. The streets inside the colony look like they were abandoned years ago.  Public places and main roads in the township are a different affair. On one September evening, amateur footballers and cricketers from nearby areas are out  practicing their skills in the cricket grounds. The Mills\u2019 workers can also be seen there in the evening, returning home after finishing their day\u2019s work. Some of them take a stroll to Pakistani Market, a strip of grocery stores and teashops, to buy items of daily use; others gather at the nearby Russian Market, once meant to cater to the Russian employees of the Mills. \n\u201cPeople keep complaining about what has happened to Pakistan Steel\nMills,\u201d says Farooq, \u201cbut they never ask what part they have played in\nit.\u201d\nNow it is almost deserted, with just a few shops open. The proprietor of one of them has reportedly sold so many  groceries to the residents of the township on credit that his store appears abandoned, with empty shelves and a few items carelessly displayed.   According to some local residents, people in the township owe him as much as 5.5 million rupees. The sole reason why people are unable to pay him back is that they are no longer receiving their salaries and other dues as regularly as they should. Taj Begum knows what living without money is like. Inside the living area of her two-bedroom, single-storey house, her economic conditions are hard to disguise. A single couch bravely tries to fill space enough for a five-seat sofa set and its accompanying tables. It is time for the customary electricity outage. Begum\u2019s husband, Bashir Khan, is asleep, after having worked during the night shift at the Iron-Making Department. His job involves monitoring the casting process, which requires working right next to moulds that contain liquid iron with a surface temperature of nearly 1,200 degrees Celsius. These days, he spends seven hours at work, sitting with other workers and roaming around idle machinery.  Khan and Taj Begum have been married for nearly 30 years. They have seen better times. Taj Begum remembers the time when workers received their salaries as early as the 26th or 27th of the month, rather than waiting for the end of the month. And not just salaries \u2014 bonuses, too. Today, with no salary, she is finding it almost impossible to run her household. She has no money to send her four children to college and eventually marry them off. \n\nRetired employee of Pakistan Steel Mills, Shabbir Jumani, has been waiting for his provident fun and gratuity for nearly two years\n\n\nShe does not complain though and wonders out loud about the families of those workers who do not live in the township and, instead, reside in rented houses. Even when the workers get salaries, they do not know how much of it has been deducted in lieu of house rent and electricity bill because they are not being given their pay slips. Malik Waqas, a resident of the township and an employee of Pakistan Steel Mills, says his father\u2019s salary is around 65,000 rupees \u2014 but he received only 9,000 rupees the last time. The rest was deducted under various heads.Some workers complain that those living in two-bedroom houses are told that as much as 20,000 rupees have been deducted from their salaries as electricity bills. \u201cAn electricity bill of 21,000 rupees was deducted from the last salary I received,\u201d says Naimatullah, an employee of the Mills. Next month, the management again deducted the same amount as the price of electricity he had consumed. \u201cHalf of my salary is going into paying for electricity. I cannot pay this amount every month,\u201d he says.Shabbir Jumani, 63, cannot deal with such pecuniary anxieties. On the steps of the township\u2019s administration office, he breaks down.He joined the Mills in 1980 and retired in December 2014 as a machinist. \u201cI have not received a single penny after retirement,\u201d he says. He lowers his head every now and then, trying to hold back tears. Close to two years have passed, but he continues to wait for the receipt of his provident fund and gratuity. He does not know if he can get any other job. \u201cI am turned away from wherever I go looking for a job because I am too old to work,\u201d he says. Others complain that the Mills\u2019 management is failing to provide them health facilities at a time when they do not have the money to pay for them. Waqas, who has just returned from a visit to the Mills\u2019 hospital, sheds light on the healthcare facilities available to the workers. \u201cYou cannot even get an X-ray done there,\u201d he says. They have no syringes, no medicine; the doctors are there only to sign sick leaves. Health facilities are in a dire state mainly due to rampant corruption among the management. According to a recent story published in the daily Dawn, the FIA has found enough \u201cevidence\u201d against the senior management of Pakistan Steel Mills to prove that it was involved in misappropriating funds worth millions of rupees meant for procurement of medicine supplies. Medicine purchases were also \u201cmade from unregistered sellers of medicines and from \u2018freelancers\u2019 who were originally engaged in the supply of hardware, tools and general items\u201d to the Mills, the newspaper stated on October 1, 2016. \n\nImran Khan's stage at a protest in front of Pakistan Steel Mills, held on September 5, 2016\n\n\nA stage is being set in front of the Jinnah gate of Pakistan Steel Mills. Imran Khan, chairman of the Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI), is scheduled to arrive here to address the Mills\u2019 workers. Before his arrival, his party\u2019s activists grab as many PTI flags as they can and throw them towards the workers, waiting for Khan\u2019s arrival. Most of them are not PTI supporters. They, however, are here because they say Khan is at least showing up to express solidarity with them, unlike other political leaders who are least concerned about them. They are grateful to him. When Khan finally arrives, he does not speak to anyone and heads straight to the stage where he sits in a chair for a while as local leaders of his party and some of the Mills\u2019 workers deliver speeches. When his turn comes, he wastes little time in formalities and gets to the topic of Pakistan Steel Mills straight away. \u201cThis industry has been robbed,\u201d he says to a crowd of about 150 people. \u201cAnd those who have robbed it are residing as billionaires in big palaces.\u201d The crowd erupts in agreement and cheers him on. Khan continues: \u201cAnd who has paid the price for it? The workers of Pakistan Steel Mills.\u201dBetween his speech, some in the crowd chant \u201cGo Nawaz go\u201d, but their slogans are drowned by his voice blaring from the speakers. It is obvious that he knows very little about the Mills. \u201cToday, I am here with you because an industry that was making a profit of eight billion rupees in 2007 has been closed for five months.\u201d As he pauses, someone standing behind him tries to correct him \u2014 \u201cit has been closed 11 months,\u201d he says. Another person corrects him again. \u201cIt has been closed for 13 months,\u201d he intones.  \nIn the workers\u2019 colony, houses are smaller. Some do not even have\ndoors; curtains made of discarded bed sheets block off their\nentrances.\nFajar Ahmed, 62, is sitting among the audience. He is part of a labour organisation called the Insaf Workers Ittehad. It is not affiliated with PTI or any other party. It is just another group of workers, demanding their rights through a sit-in right next to the Mills\u2019 entrance. They have been protesting for close to two months now.  Ahmed has a large family \u2014 consisting of his wife, two sons, two daughters and his parents. He has worked at Pakistan Steel Mills for 26 years \u2014 first as a daily wage worker and, since 2010, as a regular employee. His job involves handling four different machines at the coke oven plant. He and others in his group took out a protest demonstration outside the Mills on August 3 this year. They marched from Pakistan Steel Mills to a nearby highway, demanding the release of their salaries, improvement in medical facilities and the clearance of post-retirement dues, among other things. The Mills\u2019 management did not bother to heed their demands. Instead, it sent show cause notices to all those workers who had participated in the protest, asking them to explain why they had marched on to the streets \u2014 as if everything was perfectly fine with the Mills and there was absolutely nothing to complain about.   It was perhaps under pressure from such protests that Finance Minister Ishaq Dar approved the payment of salaries for the months of April 2016 and May 2016, amounting to 760 million rupees, on September 7, 2016. He also approved the payment of gratuity and provident funds for some of the retired employees, amounting to 322.021 million rupees. \n\nWorkers of Pakistan Steel Mills protest on September 5, 2016\n\n\nIn the middle of last month, Ahmed and his fellow protesters are sitting in their sit-in camp. They are discussing problems that the workers and their families are facing. One of them says some shopkeepers around the Mills have placed signboards outside their shops telling Pakistan Steel Mills workers to stay away. The discussion then moves on to the role of the Peoples Workers Union: the CBA. A pamphlet issued by the Insaf Workers Ittehad gives details of the official vehicles being used by the CBA members \u2014 as well as the fuel and maintenance costs of those vehicles. According to a trade unionist, scrap stocked at a place called China Plant is being picked up illegally and sold at reduced prices. But what exactly is scrap? Since the Mills is not operational, it has tonnes of raw materials or half-finished products that cannot go into the next stage of production. These products are mostly in the form of metal slabs and rolled sheets kept outdoors in stockyards. Over time, rain and dew have corroded them, leaving them rusted and making them appear like scrap. Rehan Shah, a trade unionist and chairman of the Workers Welfare Trust, a non-profit organisation, recently wrote a letter to the Privatisation Commission after he came to know that the management of Pakistan Steel Mills had sought permission from the ministry of industries and production to sell those articles as \u2018scrap\u2019. When the management is given permission for the sale, it sells that \u2018scrap\u2019 to private buyers at the price of \u201cdust\u201d, he wrote. Since there is a history of selling scrap at extremely low rates, as Shah pointed out in his letter, it is likely that the raw material and half-finished products now lying around in the Mills can one day be sold in a similar way. \u201cThe sale of scrap is a form of corruption,\u201d Shah noted.\nAccording to a trade unionist, scrap stocked at a place called China\nPlant is being picked up illegally and sold at reduced prices.\nOther workers allege that a large racket is operating in the Mills to illegally transfer the raw material and unfinished products out of the Mills and then sell it at reduced rates. The workers say those involved in the theft take the materials out of the warehouses and leave them out in the open to rust. These are then loaded on to mini-trucks, which take them out of the Mills for sale. All of this, the workers allege, is taking place with the connivance of the CBA, the management and the security staff.These allegations are almost impossible to substantiate. Firstly, it is not easy to lift those very heavy articles without cranes and forklifts. Without a concerted activity by a good number of people and without the help of machines, loading them onto trucks that then take them out of the Mills\u2019 premises seems impossible. It must involve commotion at a scale that cannot go unnoticed. The management adds that the entrances and exits to the Mills are well-guarded and no vehicle can move in and out without official permission.   The account of at least two incidents of theft on a much smaller scale, though, can be found in a police record. On the morning of March 31 this year, various types of cable wires \u2013 including telephone cables and polyvinyl chloride wires used to make flexible tubing, upholstery and flooring \u2013 were stolen from two different stores located close to the Mills\u2019 transport department. Ikramuddin, son of Alauddin, an employee of Pakistan Steel Mills, had a police report registered about the theft on April 3, 2016,  at Bin Qasim Police Station, \u201con the direction of his senior officers\u201d. The length of the stolen wires was reported to be 2,370 metres for one type and 164 metres for the other. \n\nA dispensary inside Karachi Steel Mill Township\n\n\nRehan Shah has invited all the serving and recently retired employees of Pakistan Steel Mills to attend a court hearing on September 2, 2016. He filed a petition at the Sindh High Court on March 18, 2015, for the payment of staff salaries. \u201cIt is mandatory for all employees to be present at the Sindh High Court at 8 am,\u201d reads the text message that he has sent around. Nobody shows up, except one former employee: Muhammad Akram. Shah is agitated. With a file full of documents in one hand and his phone in the other, he is nervously walking in and out of the courtroom. The rest of the workers, Shah tells me, are getting on the buses and will soon be heading to the court. His hopes do not materialise.  Shah is known among the workers as Comrade Rehan. A soft-spoken, simple and unassuming man, he began to fight for the rights of labourers when he joined Pakistan Steel Mills in 1993 as a junior assistant. He initially worked in the accounts department, but once the management discovered his union activities, it transferred him to the coke oven plant. When you work there, he says, the black dust from the coal is so thick around you that it covers your entire body. When the Mills had been operational, the coke plant could generate enough electricity to pay off the salaries of all the workers, he claims. And not just electricity, Shah says, but three different types of gases that then help run the thermal power plant. (That plant once generated 165 megawatts of electricity. After fulfilling the Mills\u2019 needs, the management would sell the surplus for distribution in other localities.) Shah\u2019s transfer did not stop him from doing what he had been doing. New employees were hired at the time and Shah discovered that they were not receiving any hazard benefits. He helped all of them fill in a form to claim those benefits. That is how he came to be known as Comrade Rehan. From then on, Shah stepped in where and when workers\u2019 rights were being compromised. He has received 20 show cause notices for his activism, he tells the Herald, laughing. \n\nInside the iron making department of Pakistan Steel Mills\n\n\nSince Rehan filed his petition, there have been about half a dozen hearings. There has been no substantial progress in the case though. As the judges rise to leave for Friday prayers at 12:30 pm on September 2, Shah and his lawyer, Nadeem Shaikh, go to their desk and plead for a hearing. This is a matter of life and death for 13,000 employees of Pakistan Steel Mills who have not been receiving their salaries, Shaikh quickly tells the judges (who are scheduled to hear over 30 other cases that day). The judges listen to him briefly and give him the date for the next hearing: September 21. On that day, too, no more than two workers join Shah at the court. The judges hear the case for a few minutes and adjourn it to October 25. The only development that day: the court summons the Mills\u2019 chief executive officer (CEO) to be present at the next hearing. That will only start substantial proceedings \u2014 provided the CEO turns up. How many more hearings will the court take before it issues a verdict is anyone\u2019s guess. And it is not certain if the verdict will be in the favour of the workers. The vague promise of the petition\u2019s outcome inspires no one back at the Mills. More importantly, the machines will not whir, the plants will not hum, the furnaces will not radiate \u2014 even if the judges decide the case tomorrow. \nShamshad Qureshi, Chairman of the Peoples Workers Union (CBA), Pakistan Steel Mills, responded to the story after it was published, in a letter to the Herald. Here is the edited version of his reponse:This refers to the article \u201cBurnt Out: The demise of Pakistan Steel Mills\u201d, that appeared in the Herald\u2019s October 2016 issue. The article stated that I was accused in the Pakistan Steel Mills canteen case, which is incorrect. The reporter never contacted me or took my point of view and made allegations against me that are totally baseless and untrue. As CBA chairman, I have no role to play in the award of a canteen tender. I was never implicated or nominated in the First Information Report (FIR) as mentioned in the article. Peoples Workers Union won the 2008 referendum, held under the supervision of NIRC, with a substantial margin. The registration of all seven of its opposing unions was cancelled by the government.To imply that PPP appointed Chairman and CBA is in any way responsible for decline in performance of the Mills is incorrect. It is the job of the federal government to appoint the management of steel mills and monitor their performance.  The chairman was sacked on corruption charges by the then Prime Minister at the floor of National Assembly on 18-8-2009; the case was then directed to the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) for further investigation. Peoples Workers Union won the referendum for a third time in a row in November 2013 during the tenure of the present PML-N government. This proves the confidence of the workers in the union.\nThis article was originally published in the Herald's October 2016 issue.

The shipment, an Indian gift for Afghanistan, was sent from the western seaport of Kandla. It will be taken by trucks to Afghanistan from the Iranian port. The new trade route follows an air freight corridor introduced between India and Afghanistan in June last year to provide greater access for Afghan goods to the Indian market. In his new Afghanistan strategy unveiled in August, US President Donald Trump asked India to do more to help Afghanistan\u2019s development. Pakistan currently does not allow India to transport goods through its territory to Afghanistan because of hostility in their ties. It sees no role by India in Afghanistan. Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj said on Sunday the shipment marked the convergence among India, Afghanistan and Iran to spur an unhindered flow of commerce and trade throughout the region. \u201cI believe that this is the starting point of our journey to realise the full spectrum of connectivity from culture to commerce, from traditions to technology, from investments to IT, from services to strategy and from people to politics,\u201d Ms Swaraj said.

The Israelis were not much interested in accepting a ceasefire set to begin the previous day, and, according to Anatoly Chernyaev, a Soviet official present at the talks, Brezhnev wanted to encourage the Israelis to keep the truce by offering a Soviet guarantee of Israel\u2019s borders. Gromyko replied that the Arabs would take offence \u2014 but Brezhnev burst out that \u201cwe have been offering them [the Arabs] a sensible course of action for so many years. They wanted war and they are welcome to it \u2026 To hell with them.\u201dIt was a view long shared by Soviet military officers. I recall the remaining anger of a former Soviet instructor in Yemen during the 1962-70 civil war, who, showing me Red Square one cold afternoon, made a remark almost as contemptuous as Brezhnev\u2019s. \u201cWe helped to train the Arabs [against the monarchists] and they were useless and I think they should be on their own. Let someone else save them. Why should it be us all over again?\u201dIn October 1973, Brezhnev was saying the same thing. He swore at Gromyko, said Chernyaev, for \u201cwanting to keep our flag and bases in the Middle East\u201d. And Brezhnev then shouted out: \u201cWe will not let these .... people involve us in a world war!\u201d According to author and former British intelligence official Gordon Barrass, who wrote one of the best books on the Cold War eight years ago, the Soviet airlift of military equipment to Syria stopped that very day.How lucky now are the Arab potentates and dictators to have a Russian rather than a Soviet to talk to, and a fit \u2014 some might say almost too fit \u2014 Vladimir Putin to rely on, rather than a Brezhnev. A vacillating Obama and a lunatic Trump, of course, do the impossible: they make Putin look like a Roosevelt or an Eisenhower \u2014 perhaps even the swashbuckling Theodore Roosevelt with his Rough Riders.Putin\u2019s Rough Riders in Syria are crushing the militant Islamic State group threat \u2014 and any other threat \u2014 for Bashar al-Assad\u2019s government. The Russians are not just bombing Assad\u2019s enemies and re-arming the Syrian army but helping to arrange ceasefires. I watched them escorting al-Nusra and other still-armed Islamist fighters from Homs all the way to the Turkish front line at al-Bab (inside Syria). Russian armoured vehicles stood on both sides of that line this year \u2014 I saw them with my own eyes \u2014 alongside both Syrian and Turkish occupation troops.Putin has learned a few tricks from the Brezhnev days. Just as the bankrupt Soviet president put Tajik Muslim Soviet military units into bases west of Kabul, so Putin has deployed Chechen Muslim Russian soldiers into Palmyra. But these Russians are not the Soviets of Afghanistan infamy. Many of the officers speak fluent Arabic (and, please note, pretty good English). Putin knows how to measure Russian power in the Middle East, happy to keep Moscow\u2019s \u201cflag and bases\u201d in the region. And playing Bismark across the Arab world, even in Turkey and Israel.Egypt\u2019s field marshal/president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi took Putin to a Verdi performance in Cairo. Iran will host him before the end of this year. Putin welcomes both Assad loyalists and Syrian rebels to Astana. He invites both Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and his racist (and Soviet-born) defence minister Lieberman \u2014 who once advocated drowning Palestinian prisoners in the Dead Sea \u2014 to the Kremlin. And of course, he won the cachet of a visit from King Salman of Saudi Arabia to the Kremlin.Undemocratic, brutally suppressing his own internal political opponents, hateful of all Muslim extremists \u2014 he suggested that Moscow doctors could emasculate them \u2014 careless of what others say of his air force\u2019s bombing in Syria and we must not forget Ukraine and Crimea and Western sanctions, in the Middle East he can wear the mantle of an international statesman. It might all come to grief for Putin. Failing to foresee the outcome of his actions was regarded as his greatest fault when he was a KGB officer in Dresden. But he\u2019s been sending in groups of Russian military non-FSB intelligence men to Syria, some of them \u2014 in Aleppo \u2014 reporting directly to the Kremlin. Maybe he has learned a thing or two.And so we come back to King Salman\u2019s visit to Moscow. Here is a man whose kingdom maintains the same purist Wahhabi faith which inspires IS and the Taliban and Al Qaeda. He signed preliminary agreements to buy Russia\u2019s S-400 air defence missile systems. Of course, the king\u2019s long speech \u2014 he enjoyed his Kremlin banquet, they say \u2014 talked about the necessity of preventing Iran\u2019s destabilisation of the Middle East. Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov said Russia \u201csupports the efforts of the Saudi kingdom in trying to unify the Syrian opposition\u201d. Which particular opposition, one might like to know? So, I imagine, would Assad.Yet the king was, according to Russian officials in the Middle East, asked to participate in the rebuilding of Syria when its war finally peters out. Quite a role for King Salman if Assad \u2014 as all believe he will \u2014 remains the president (or in some similar role) in Syria. But of course, it would be Russia who does the rebuilding, Saudi Arabia who paid for it. So the two vast oil nations now seem to be set on a course of mutual collaboration. So much for Trump\u2019s $300 billion weapons deal with the King. Maybe Salman is smarter than we think. If Putin might, for Washington, be Ivan the Terrible, that\u2019s better than being Trump the Farcical for the Arabs.Putin knows the Saudi weaknesses; Riyadh\u2019s war in Yemen (not unlike the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan) and the attacks on the kingdom, not least the mysterious explosion outside the king\u2019s palace just before his visit to Moscow; after which the Saudi Press Agency admitted that three armed men had tried to enter the building. And beware, if the Saudis resist the Russian offer on Syria, Putin can always turn \u2014 and many there are in Syria who believe this \u2014 to Qatar, with which the Saudis still maintain their childish feud. The Saudis will remember how Putin encouraged an Islamic conference in Chechnya \u2014 but sent no invitations to Saudi clerics. Putin still keeps a Russian military base in the Caucasus \u2014 in formerly Soviet Armenia. The Armenian parliament has this month, quite unnoticed in the Western media, ratified a new military defence treaty with Russia. So, please note, Turkey \u2014 which still claims to \u201cprotect\u201d Turkish Azerbaijan against the \u201caggression\u201d of Armenia.And watch out to the Kurds south of Turkey\u2019s border (both the Syrian and Turkish variety), whose notional independence has received no support from Moscow. They will not be defended by Putin when the US betrays them again (Kurds having died in lieu of US ground troops in Raqa and Mosul). Putin knows who the major powers are. Yes, he would like to take over the pseudo-neutral peace-making role of the US in securing a Palestinian state but, as a Palestinian socialist (of whom few are left) says in Beirut, don\u2019t hold your breath. When Moscow agreed to sell Kornet anti-tank missiles to little Lebanon last month, Prime Minister Saad Hariri was apparently a bit stunned to be told that the Russians would not hand over the weapons on credit. Russian and Lebanese finance ministry officials are to discuss this matter. Readers will wait in vain for the outcome.Wearying clich\u00e9s about the Russian Bear or Putin the Fox \u2014 as he is actually called in Cairo \u2014 do no credit to any serious analysis of Russian behaviour in the Middle East. This is ruthless power politics, of course, only accentuated by Washington\u2019s inane and insane president. Everything must be in Russia\u2019s interest \u2014 militarily, economically, internationally and domestically. And amorally, too.But sometimes the Arabs \u2014 and the Iranians and the Turks, and the Israelis, too \u2014 must wonder if there is, here, just a little bit of Putin\u2019s own persona, the one he wants to show to the world: warrior, peacemaker, negotiator, friend of all who do not threaten Russia. And enemy of all those who do. Who will be the next, then, to offer Moscow another Russian air base or warm-water harbour, military facilities in the Mediterranean, even welcome Russian warships into Middle Eastern ports? And who will be the last to deny Putin?But he\u2019s not trying to solve the region\u2019s problems, whatever he may say. He\u2019s still taking risks, not least in Syria. To some extent he\u2019s playing with the people of the region. More importantly, however, he\u2019s establishing Russia in the Middle East. No one will do anything now without first thinking of Putin\u2019s reaction. That\u2019s what political power is really about.\u2014By arrangement with The IndependentPublished in Dawn, October 21st, 2017\n", "title": "Puppetmaster Putin tugs his strings in Middle East", "author": "Robert Fisk"}, "1281378": {"date": "Updated September 04, 2016", "article": "Once the most ubiquitous part of Karachi\u2019s heritage, Irani \u2018hotels\u2019 are fast disappearing from the urban landscape...The Irani cafes of Karachi\nby Asif NooraniSometime in the 1920s, Rustom Aspandiar Bahmani, a Zoroastrian, left Yazd, then a small desert town in Iran, with his companions. All of them perched on mulebacks trotted all the way to Zahidan, from where they took a painfully slow train to Quetta. A faster train took them to Karachi from where they boarded a sailboat to Bombay. After a six-day voyage, the vessel dropped anchor at the city\u2019s harbour. The city was not unfamiliar to Zoroastrians. Waves of Zoroastrians had migrated from Iran between the 8th and 10th centuries and had made their way up the social ladder as successful businessmen and industrialists. Quite understandably, they were supportive of their co-religionists. To cut a long story short, Bahmani, like other Zoroastrians, made their mark in the restaurant business. They were followed by Bahais, practitioners of the 19th century religion, and Muslims. The latter moved to the state of Hyderabad in large numbers.A good number of Iranis didn\u2019t go to Bombay, however; they decided to settle down in Karachi. There were more than a hundred Irani restaurants (Irani hotels in common parlance) in Karachi in the 1970s but today hardly 10 remain. After Independence, not many opened in the newer parts of the city. Caf\u00e9 Liberty and the one in Nursery market in PECHS (whose name nobody seems to recall) were among the exceptions. Areas such as Defence Housing Authority and North Nazimabad never had a single Irani restaurant.The middle class localities and commercial areas of the city were once punctuated with Irani restaurants. Most of them had \u2018cafes\u2019 preceding their names. Four restaurants were in close proximity in Saddar. Fredrick\u2019s Cafeteria was the haunt of punters who frequented the place after placing bets at the city\u2019s racecourse. It also had a pay phone which one could use after inserting two coins of 10 paisas each in the slots. Caf\u00e9 George, on the intersection of Victoria Road (now Abdullah Haroon Road) and Frere Road (now Shahrah-i-Liaquat) was known for its snacks, particularly its mutton patties and the accompanying chutney concocted by its cook (chef was a term that was yet to come in vogue). On the other side of the road was Eastern Coffee House, which was named India Coffee House until a few years after Partition. It was initially run by the India Coffee Board, (ICB), which ran a chain of coffee houses since the mid-1930s (it still does in India). India Coffee House in Saddar became Zelin\u2019s Coffee House but, soon after, an Irani took over, who christened it Eastern Coffee House. Mr Merchant, a coffee-taster turned manager at the ICB, then set up Pioneer Coffee House in what is now the Electronics Market. Eastern Coffee House was the haunt of writers and student leaders. Some people were regular visitors. Come rain or shine, they were there in the afternoons. Once the Marxist student leader Ali Mukhtar Rizvi, who was part of the Moharram zuljina juloos, climbed up the stairs, had a quick cup of tea before joining the tail of the long procession. Then there was one Mr Bilgrami, who never loosened the buttons of his sherwani even when mercury crossed the 110oF mark. In those days air conditioning in restaurants was a rarity. Only Shehzan and Pioneer had that facility. Fredrick\u2019s Cafetaria and Eastern Coffee House had sections for families as well. As you walked towards the Elphinstone Street (now Zebunnisa Street), you saw Caf\u00e9 Parisian (the septuagenarian Parisian Bakery is still there). Then as you proceeded towards the corner of Bohri Bazaar, you saw the plebeian Boman Abadon Irani Restaurant where ready-made tea was served. Outside the restaurant there was a row of shoe-shine men from what was then the NWFP (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). You would place your foot on a pedestal and the man seated on a stool would live up to his promise of making your shoe shine like a mirror. \u201cSheesha banaiga\u201d used to be their slogan.Diagonally opposite the Parisian was Caf\u00e9 Gulzar, which had its loyal clientele too. The Karachi-born singer C.H. Atma, who had migrated to Bombay, visited his native city sometime in the \u201960s. He made it a point to visit two places \u2014 Abdullah Shah Ghazi\u2019s mazaar and Caf\u00e9 Gulzar. In an interview with a local journalist he said that whereas he got spiritual satisfaction at the mausoleum, the food in his favourite restaurant gave him gastronomic satisfaction. \u201cIt still tastes as delicious as it did before Partition,\u201d he said.At the other end of Victoria Road, opposite Hotel Metropole, was Caf\u00e9 Victoria, which was spacious and comfortable. It had a number of delicacies listed on its menu, but to a friend, who frequented it in the \u201960s, the piece-de-resistance was the Mahi Kabab \u2014 \u2018mahi\u2019 being the Persian word for fish. Caf\u00e9 Subhani, close to Fleet Club, was widely known for its Chullu Kabab, an Iranian specialty kabab served over a bed of buttered rice. It closed down a year or two ago. It is now owned by locals, who have refurbished it and renamed it Chullu Kabab Sistani.Two Irani restaurants which are still there are adjacent to each other. Pehlvi Restaurant, at the intersection of M.A. Jinnah Road and Zebunnisa Street, offers tea in cups and also has a small stall which serves tea in chainaks \u2014 small metallic teapots. Next to it is Caf\u00e9 Durakhshan, owned by the same family, where tea is served in teapots, accompanied with sugar in a pot and milk in a small jug. Its fastest selling dish is the Spicy Pulao. It retains the feel of old while Pehlvi seems to have morphed into a more modern fast food joint.Almost invariably all Irani restaurants, not just in Karachi but also in Mumbai and Pune, are located at street corners, a testament to their early-mover advantage in real estate. They are open on two sides. It seems Pehlvi and Durakhshan were once one restaurant but were later divided between two siblings, so the latter does not enjoy having entrances from two sides. The present owners simply refuse to comment on this subject.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKhairabad now and then: (Left) present day; (Right) 1947 as M.A. Jinnah\u2019s motorcade drove past (Photo from State Bank Museum)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe only Irani Restaurant which was not in a corner was Caf\u00e9 Gloria in the small lane which is still called Capitol ki Gali. Capitol was one of the two cinemas owned by the Mobed family, who were Parsis. Flamingo, a snazzy restaurant on the first floor of the cinema, was particularly known for its cold coffee. While Flamingo was owned by a Zoroastrian, Caf\u00e9 Gloria\u2019s proprietor was a Bahai. Capitol Cinema and its twin, Paradise Cinema, have vanished like many other movie houses in Saddar. Caf\u00e9 Yasmeen near the Police Head Office on I.I. Chundrigar Road was the latest Irani restaurant demise and the one to suffer the most is the paanwallah outside \u2014all Irani restaurants have paan shops tucked in small spaces outside the premises. The paanwallah has lost his clientele and now closes shop at 6pm.Not too far from Cafe Yasmeen was Caf\u00e9 Victory on what was South Napier Road, which was renamed Altaf Hussain Road after the founding editor of Dawn. With the offices of the Dawn Group and Millat Publications being there, journalists thronged the caf\u00e9 at lunch hour. It was known particularly for its succulent beef steak and the sauce that topped it. Perhaps the only Irani restaurant which is faring quite well is Khairabad Tea Shop (see interview). It has its loyal clientele, some of whom keep returning even after years. Syed Abdullah Shah, the chief minister of Sindh from 1993-1996, paid a visit to have tea there after assuming the top office in the province. He recalled that Khairabad was his usual haunt while studying at the nearby S.M. Law College.    But why are so many Irani restaurants closing down despite their being a part of Karachi\u2019s heritage? Young Abbas Ahmed of Caf\u00e9 Durakhshan, an MBA, has the answer. \u201cFor one thing, the trend has changed,\u201d he says. \u201cNow there are fast food joints as well as eateries which specialise in items such as nihari, biryani or barbecue. Secondly, there is much hassle in running restaurants, particularly when the profits have dipped. You would be better off selling the restaurant and putting the money in fixed deposit.\u201d Why have the marble top tables that were the mark of Irani restaurants disappeared? \u201cSimply because they were too space consuming,\u201d explains Ahmed.  \u201cBut the bentwood chairs are still there. In fact, you are sitting on one. The large mirrors which give the impression of extra space have not disappeared either.\u201dThe Iranis are still very much into selling tea leaves. \u201cTwo of the leading shops, Islamia Tea and Iranian Tea are doing quite well,\u201d Ahmed points out. Irani restaurants may be vanishing but they have left their mark on their city. Proof, if proof be needed, is that the Tariq Road and Allama Iqbal Road intersection is still called Caf\u00e9 Liberty and the area near Fleet Club is known as Lucky Star, after the restaurants which dropped shutters years ago.\n\u201cThere were close to 100 Irani restaurants in the 50s and 60s, now there are less than 10.\u201d \u2014 Abbas Ali the proprietor of Khairabad Tea Shop\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAbbas Ali\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAbbas Ali, the proprietor of Khairabad Tea Shop, mans the counter of the restaurant at the intersection of I.I. Chundrigar Road and Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road for at least six to eight hours a day. He greets you with a cheerful Khushamdeed (\u2018Welcome\u2019). However, if you wish to interview him, he politely asks you to see him after the peak hours \u2014 12 noon to 4pm. I talk to him when he is relatively free. AN: When was this restaurant set up? AA: In 1932 by my grandfather, who had migrated from Iran. My father was then a young man. AN: How come you call it a tea shop? I don\u2019t recall seeing an Irani restaurant in Karachi or Mumbai, not even Pune, where any restaurant bore that description. They are all called \u2018cafes\u2019, even though coffee is not a popular drink in our country, nor in that part of India. AA: That\u2019s a question that you should have asked my father, but he is up in the heavens. However, if you look at our menu displayed under the glass, you will find that we have renamed the restaurant. It is called \u2018Caf\u00e9 Khairabad (Tea Shop) and Food Centre\u2019. It\u2019s too long a name to be painted on the board fixed on top of the entrances so we have continued with the original name. AN: Why Khairabad?AA: That is where my family hails from in Iran. You will see quite a few restaurants named after the towns from where their owners belonged to. [There were also Caf\u00e9 Meharabad and Caf\u00e9 Ispahan, to name just two.] Sadly, they are among the many Irani restaurants that have dropped shutters. The latest casualty is Caf\u00e9 Yasmeen, which was on this very road. There were close to a hundred Irani restaurants in the 50s and 60s, now there are less than 10.AN: What\u2019s the reason for closures on such a vast scale?AA: The business is not that good. The electricity and gas charges are prohibitively high. The prices of meat and vegetables, not to mention cooking oil, have risen considerably. Wages have gone up too. We can\u2019t raise the food charges accordingly because there is strong consumer resistance.AN: The owners of Irani restaurants that I have met complain that extortion by members of political parties is a major cause of dropping the shutters. What do you have to say on that issue?AA: I wouldn\u2019t like to comment on that. You are a journalist. You should know better. (Smiles) AN: What business do the Iranis who close their restaurants do after selling the premises which are invariably on prime locations? AA: They go back to Iran. There is no future for us here. Even those Iranis who were born here have not been given Pakistani nationalities. AN: How come Khairabad is a longish-shaped restaurant, unlike others?AA: My grandfather bought a shop and turned it into a tea shop. My father bought two more [which he combined], which is why you get that impression.AN: You have a fast food joint very close to Khairabad. Fast food joints are not your cup of tea. They are different from Irani restaurants. Then there is Ramzani Bakery which is a few steps ahead of Agha Fastfoods.  How will you explain this diversion?AA: We have to keep pace with the changing times. And as for the bakery, may I remind you that bakeries have always been a part of the operations. Many restaurants have bakeries next door.AN: Why does Agha Fastfoods remain closed on Sundays?AA: There are no clients on Sundays and public holidays because this is a commercial area. Even Khairabad has many empty seats on the second half of Saturdays and whole day on Sundays.  \u2014 AN.\nMemories of Avalon\nA regular customer shares memories of his favourite haunt in the 60s\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe traditional bentwood chairs of Irani \u2018hotels\u2019\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nKhan Sahib (not his real name) in his late seventies but his memory of his college days is surprisingly quite sharp. He used to bunk his classes when he was studying for his B.A. For this reason it took him six years after matriculation to complete his graduation, which otherwise he could have done in four years.When I, his junior, approach him for his views on Avalon, the Irani restaurant, where he used to hold his \u2018darbar\u2019, he sounds reluctant. \u201cI shall talk to you only if you promise me that you won\u2019t publish my name because I don\u2019t want my grandchildren to know that their grandpa used to bunk classes,\u201d he lays down just one condition.I recall that there were always some freeloaders who wanted free cups of tea and often \u2018maska bun\u2019 (buttered bun). Khan Sahib, the son of an affluent jeweller, was never short of cash. More than that, he was quite generous and never hesitated to loosen his purse strings.Drifting down memory lane, Khan Sahib says, \u201cAlmost all Irani restaurants were quite spacious but Avalon was perhaps the largest in terms of space. A table in one corner, from where I could watch college girls going to Sind Muslim College and DJ Science College, was unofficially reserved for me. Let me be honest, I never had the guts to talk to them but, on the other hand, I served as Agony Aunt to boys whose \u2018crush\u2019 for girls was never reciprocated.\u201dKhan Sahib further says, \u201cAvalon was a second grade Irani restaurant where readymade tea was served in tea cups. They were never full or else tea would have spilt in saucers. Payments were made at the counter and the waiters were not given tips. However, I did reward them occasionally, which was why I was given what was known as \u2018VIP treatment\u2019. For instance, I was never served tea in a chipped cup. Like other restaurants of their type, they also served what was known as Sulemani Chai, which was light tea, devoid of milk. Green tea came in vogue much later.\u201d Admiring the servers\u2019 memory, Khan Sahib says, \u201cThe waiters would remember what they had served on which table and how much money was to be collected. Surprisingly, when a bearer [as the waiter was called in those days] had to hand over the charge to his successor at the end of his shift, he would tell them how much money was to be paid by every customer. \u201cIn those days one could share a table with a stranger, without bothering to take his permission,\u201d he recalls. My table was an exception. My flashy moustaches \u2014 now no more, thanks to my wife \u2014 kept the intruders away. \u201cTwo notices were displayed prominently on the premises. One instructed the customers to refrain from discussing politics and the other advised them to check with the person manning the counter if he could handle a 10-rupee note, which was equivalent to a present day 1,000-rupee note,\u201d Khan Sahib reminisces.\u201cI wasn\u2019t keen to graduate, but I feel that the examiners were generous when I managed to get pass marks in maths, which was my weakest subject. That was in 1964. A couple of years later when, out of sheer nostalgia, I went to have a cup of tea, I found much to my dismay, that Avalon had been replaced by a bank. The proprietor, I learnt from his neighbour, had moved back to Iran,\u201d he says. Incidentally the bank too is no more there.\u201cTo me, Avalon would have been a heritage site, had it not vanished,\u201d concluded Khan Sahib, in a wistful tone. \u2014 ANPublished in Dawn, Sunday Magazine, September 4th, 2016\n", "title": "The vanishing Irani restaurants", "author": "Asif Noorani"}, "1366574": {"date": "October 27, 2017", "article": "SARGODHA / PESHAWAR: Chief of the Army Staff Gen Qamar Javed Bajwa visited PAF Base Mushaf on Thursday and witnessed the ongoing multinational exercise ACES meet 2017 at the Air Power Centre of Excellence (ACE).

It comes as no reassurance, then, that while Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal insisted people would be allowed to air their political opinions on social media, he also announced that the FIA would spearhead the creation of a framework to monitor its use. There is a long history of politicians and dictators asserting that the state is being \u2018maligned\u2019 or \u2018belittled\u2019, and using this claim to crush dissent and enforce obsequience in both public and private realms. Given that his government passed the draconian Prevention of Electronic Crimes Act, 2016, as a PML-N member Mr Iqbal bears some responsibility in this erosion of rights. And with all the baggage of his predecessor\u2019s tenure, the onus is squarely on him to assuage any misgivings of his ministry\u2019s intentions.To do so, rather than developing a framework to monitor social media, the existing framework of digital legislation ought to be critically examined, and Peca amended so that cybercrimes are strictly and narrowly defined. The IT experts and digital rights activists the minister wants to consult had made recommendations for Peca, but were sidelined; their advice must now be incorporated. As an investigative body, FIA has no jurisdiction to define what constitutes appropriate use of social media, and there should be severe limits on its ability to monitor citizens\u2019 online activities. True, emerging threats of \u2018fake news\u2019 and foreign attempts to influence elections, which the minister cited, require careful, transparent inquiry. But what is not needed is the securitisation of the one space where it is the people who wield power. Increasingly, we have seen their power affect real change; social media has helped topple dictators, brought corruption to light and exposed sexual predators. If this upsets the status quo, so be it \u2014 the people\u2019s reckoning has been a long time coming. Published in Dawn, October 27th, 2017\n", "title": "Stifling social media", "author": "Editorial"}, "1367767": {"date": "Updated November 02, 2017", "article": "\n\nThe writer is a member of staff.\n\n\nPlanning minister Mr Ahsan Iqbal has finally confirmed that the CPEC Long Term Plan (LTP) is about to be finalised on Nov 21 at the seventh Joint Cooperation Committee to be held in Islamabad. Some might recall that details from the LTP in question were published by Dawn in a long detailed report in May, and the same minister had reacted sharply at the time, saying that the details are \u201cfactually incorrect\u201d and the real plan will be made public once it has been finalised. It looks like that moment is at last arriving, if the minister lives up to his promise of releasing the full document. If they do what they did earlier in the year, and produce a shortened, sanitised and general summary of the main LTP, and release that claiming that it is the original document, we will know that an effort is being made to conceal the real details of CPEC from the public. To recap the conversations that took place around the time when the Dawn story revealed the details of the plan, there were four main areas of focus identified by the Chinese side and a few from the Pakistanis. The Chinese appeared primarily interested in agriculture, industrial zones and tourism, along with a digital strategy to expand fibre optic connectivity and build a submarine cable landing station in Gwadar to carry some of their digital traffic from the western provinces out via Pakistan rather than routing it through servers in Europe.\nCPEC is about preparing the country to receive massive amounts of Chinese investments, personnel and culture.\nIn addition, there was a detailed financial strategy, which called upon the government of Pakistan to expand the role of the yuan in its economy, turn more to raising debt from the markets in Hong Kong, and dedicate increasing resources from its own budget, as well as provincial and local bodies\u2019 budgets, towards CPEC-related priorities.Since then, we have seen something odd happening. Many of the priorities identified in the LTP have indeed been pursued since, but without any of the fanfare associated with the inauguration of roads and power plants. For example, the national food security policy announced in July contained an entire section dedicated to the creation of CPEC-related agriculture development zones as one solution to the country\u2019s future food security issues. Many of the details in that policy document sound almost identical to the priorities highlighted by the Chinese in their LTP document, produced by the China Development Bank under the auspices of the National Development Reform Commission.In other examples, a recent news item highlighted the fact that a Chinese company has entered into an MoU with the city of Karachi to build an elevated road, almost four kilometres long, from Clifton Beach to Hawkesbay. A closer read of the actual MoU shows that the road is in fact being built to carry traffic to a Chinese resort to be built in Hawkesbay beach, possibly one of the first of the many tourist resorts to be built along the coastal strip from Badin to Gwadar identified in the Dawn report.There are innumerable examples now. Land acquisition is under way in various areas around KP to build housing for Chinese personnel who will reside in the province in the years when CPEC-related investment begins pouring into the country. The basic point here is simple: we have all been led to believe that CPEC is about connectivity, roads and power plants. In reality, it is about much more than that. It is about preparing the country to receive massive amounts of Chinese investments, personnel and culture. None of this implies that CPEC is a bad thing, as some people are ready to conclude without reflection. It is only to imply that the real details of what is being negotiated under the CPEC umbrella need to be publicly known, and efforts to hide these details from the public in a democratic country like Pakistan, where transparency and debate around issues of national importance are the norm, are bound to fuel adverse commentary and conspiracy theorising.When the minister issued his sharp response to the Dawn story about the LTP, he was given a clear stage upon which to air his grievances with the story. When has asked for more time to be allowed to make the details of the LTP, he was given the time he said he required. But now that he has confirmed that the LTP is about to be finalised, it must be insisted that the time to deliver on his commitment has also arrived.It is worth bearing in mind a couple of tricks that the government could resort to in order to try and wiggle out of this commitment without appearing to do so. Early in the year, when it needed provincial government assent for the plan, it generated a shorter, edited draft of the original LTP and circulated that to the provincial governments. Later, the government tried to argue that the edited version is the real one, and the longer, detailed draft was only a \u201cworking document\u201d. A few people fell for this gimmick, thinking that somehow there are multiple drafts of the plan in play. In reality there was only one, and the shorter one was only a summary meant for public consumption with all vital details removed. Such gimmickry must not be resorted to this time. The LTP is one of the most important documents in the arena these days, far more than the LNG contract that members of the opposition parties are clamouring for access to. It is bewildering to see the same members of the opposition parties holding their silence regarding the disclosure of the LTP. How has the silence of the opposition parties been obtained? Have they seen the LTP to be satisfied that no further discussion is required? The demands for CPEC transparency are more consequential for Pakistan\u2019s long-term prospects, especially for its economy, and silence does not serve that interest well.

In her 17 years as a member of the patrol, Ma has witnessed few incidents, she said, because \u201cBeijing is so safe\u201d.\u201cWe\u2019re more here to give community members a sense of security,\u201d she beamed, undeterred by the grey smog and light rain. \u201cPeople see us and feel that they\u2019re being taken care of. And when government officials see us during important political events, they know that we\u2019re supporting their work.\u201d Dama duties There are 850,000 registered public security volunteers in Beijing, the city announced this summer, organising under neighbourhood tags like the \u201cFengtai Persuaders\u201d, the \u201cChaoyang Masses\u201d and the \u201cXicheng Dama.\u201d (In Chinese, \u201cdama\u201d is a colloquial term used to describe rambunctious elderly women who congregate in loud groups, dance in public squares and mind other people\u2019s business.) Despite their striking \u201cvolunteer\u201d armbands, many of the patrollers approached by AFP appeared not to be serving the people for free.One middle-aged woman standing outside a subway station looked up from her phone long enough to say that it was \u201ccompany policy\u201d not to speak to reporters.Another two armband-wearers who were helping to direct traffic in a busy commercial district appeared bewildered when asked whether they were volunteers.\u201cWe\u2019re working,\u201d said a woman who looked harried as she pointed a driver to a parallel parking spot. \u201cThey just gave us these armbands to wear.\u201d Even Ma, who also handles Communist Party affairs on her neighbourhood committee, earns 3,000 yuan ($450) a month for performing her duties.These range from telling people about their retirement benefits to helping them rid their homes of mice.\u201cAll my neighbours know me,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives me a warm feeling inside.\u201d Several other volunteers declined to be interviewed, either because they were \u201con duty\u201d or were concerned that a foreign journalist would not lend \u201cpositive energy\u201d to their vocation.\u2018Hope for our country\u2019 Some of the neighbourhood patrollers were truly volunteers, claiming no benefits other than the joys of the job.Standing outside a shopping centre, a 68-year-old who only gave his surname, Ren, complained about the air pollution.While major political events in Beijing generally enjoy blue skies brought on by government-ordered factory shutdowns, the party congress has faced rainy weather and grey air.Ren\u2019s daughter lives in Vancouver, Canada, where the air is much better, he said. But he doesn\u2019t plan on moving there.\u201cMy whole life is in China,\u201d he said.Ren started volunteering during the 2008 Beijing Olympics. His main duty, he said, has been giving tourists directions.Like many volunteers, he was impressed by Xi\u2019s lengthy opening speech on Wednesday.\u201cThe problem of corruption has not entirely been solved, but the general mood is different,\u201d Ren said. \u201cIn the past, whenever you went to the supermarket during holidays you would see officials splurging, and everyone knew they were spending public funds.\u201d Ma proudly remarked that Xi\u2019s anti-graft campaign was going strong even in her small neighbourhood office, where she isn\u2019t allowed to use the computers to shop online or play video games.\u201cBecause of the president\u2019s efforts against corruption, there is hope for our party and there is hope for our country,\u201d she said.Yang Zhiling, 69, who was collecting rubbish around a bike rack, said she was inspired by Xi\u2019s stamina. \n\u201cPresident Xi remained standing for a whole three and a half hours!

Iraqi forces shelled Kurdish military positions north and south of Altun Kupri, a town of about 9,000 people just outside the country's autonomous Kurdish region, a day after Brigadier Gen Raad Baddai gave warning he was going to enter the town. Organised Kurdish forces, known as the peshmerga, as well as irregular forces, responded with rocket fire. By mid-day, Iraq's defence ministry said anti-terrorism forces, the federal police and the country's Iranian-backed Popular Mobilization Front (PMF) militias had taken the town. But the peshmerga's general command disputed that claim, saying Kurdish fighters fought off the advance and destroyed 10 Humvees and an Abrams tank. Ercuman Turkmen, a PMF commander, said from inside the town his forces were being targeted by sniper fire. Speaking to the AP by phone, he said he had no orders to enter the Kurdish autonomous region. There were no casualty reports but AP reporters saw ambulances outside the town. The boundaries of the country's Kurdish region have long been disputed between Baghdad and Irbil, the Kurdish capital, but Kurdish forces this week withdrew in most areas to positions they last held in 2014, effectively restoring the contours of the map to the time before the rise of the militant Islamic State (IS) group. They pulled out of nearby Kirkuk after brief clashes and handed over surrounding oil fields nearly without a fight, but they held on to Altun Kupri, making a symbolic last stand in front of the vastly more powerful Iraqi army. \u201cThe Kurdistan peshmerga forces have resisted heroically in this confrontation and have recorded a great honour,\u201d the peshmerga general command said in a statement released mid-day. Altun Kupri is the last town on the federal side of the border on the road between Kirkuk and Irbil. Kurdish forces entered Kirkuk in 2014 when Iraq's army melted away ahead of the Islamic IS' blitz across northern and western Iraq. The city, home to over one million Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen, emerged at the heart of the dispute over whether Kurdish authorities should return the territories it acquired during the war on IS. They have lost an important stream of oil revenues with the loss of the city, dealing a serious blow to aspirations for independence. Kurdish leader Masoud Barzani championed a non-binding vote for Kurdish independence in September. Baghdad condemned it and instead demanded the return of the disputed territories, precipitating the crisis. The peshmerga are vastly outmatched by Iraq's federal armed forces and the Iranian-sponsored militias that fight alongside them. Both the Kurds and the federal forces are accustomed to calling and receiving coalition air support as part of their shared war on the IS group. \u201cThere's nothing we can do about it, honestly. I'm urging the coalition forces to come and help us.\u201d said peshmerga fighter Ibrahim Mirza. \u201cNo doubt we have martyrs.\u201d Kurdish authorities sent reinforcements to the front lines. An AP team saw a convoy of dozens of armoured vehicles arriving at the Kurdish side of the front, and fighters waiting in the town of Kustepe, on the Kurdish side of the border. Thick black smoke rose from a checkpoint north of Altun Kupri after it was hit by a shell, and ambulances rushed from the front lines into Kurdish areas. Altun Kupri is 40 kilometres northwest of Kirkuk. \n", "title": "Kurdish forces clashes with Iraqi military after Kirkuk surrender", "author": "AP"}, "1363851": {"date": "October 15, 2017", "article": "\n\nBorn on Oct 17, 1817, Syed Ahmad bin Muttaqi Khan began his career in service of the East India Company. After the war of 1857 he started working for educational reforms for the Muslims of India. In 1888 he was made a Knight Commander of the Order of the Star of India and became known as Sir Syed Ahmad Khan\n\n\nSir Syed Ahmad Khan emerged as a key leader of the Indian Muslim community in the aftermath of the War of Independence of 1857, as a thoroughly modern Muslim in a thoroughly pre-modern age. He is credited for originating the two-nation theory, founding the Aligarh Movement and being a founding father of Pakistan, but less celebrated are his achievements in providing a modern, scientific and rational interpretation of Islam and the Holy Quran, as well as his debates on culture that \u2014 in the face of stern opposition from fundamentalists and detractors \u2014 sowed the seeds of enlightenment and progress.  HIS VIEWS ON CULTURESir Syed was probably the first intellectual to present the meaning of culture as it was prevalent in the West in the 19th century. When defining the aims of his journal Tehzeeb-ul-Akhlaq in its first edition, he wrote: \u201cThe objective of issuing this journal is to persuade Indian Muslims to adopt a complete degree of civilisation, meaning culture, so that the hatred with which the civilised (cultured) nations view them should go away and they may also be said to be [one of the] exalted and cultured nations of the world.\u201d\nOctober 17 marks the bicentennial of the birth of Sir Syed Ahmad Khan, who exerted a defining influence on Indian Muslim thought. It is instructive to understand how his thinking evolved and the \nstrong oppositions he faced during his time\nExpounding on this, he wrote two detailed essays in Tehzeeb-ul-Akhlaq, \u2018Culture and its Definition\u2019 and \u2018Civilisation or Sophistication and Culture\u2019, based on a book by British historian Thomas Buckle. Buckle had tried to write the history of human civilisation in the light of scientific knowledge and also fashioned a few \u2018laws\u2019 based on inductive reasoning; for example, the law of seasons, that showed that the physical environment greatly affected human culture. Although Buckle\u2019s \u2018ideologies\u2019 went against historical facts (the physical environment of the ancient Indus Valley, Nile River Valley and Mesopotamia was different from Europe, but no one can deny the greatness of these cultures), the West enthusiastically welcomed them because Buckle had fashioned the dominance of the white nations and slavery of Asian nations into a natural law, thus presenting an ideological justification for Britain\u2019s imperialist interests. What Sir Syed wrote about man and human culture 150 years ago continues to hold true. For example, he said, \u201cThere is a close relationship between human actions and the laws of nature,\u201d meaning that the laws of human society and the movement of nature are identical. Then, \u201chuman actions and the work of their mutual milieu are subject to some predetermined law and not coincidental.\u201d Third, \u201cMan\u2019s actions are not the results of his wishes, but the results of past events.\u201d Fourth, \u201cAny human society is not free of culture\u201d and fifth, \u201cMan changes nature and nature changes Man and all events are made from this mutual exchange.\u201dIn mentioning the specific qualities of man, Sir Syed wrote that man\u2019s \u201corgans and body are ... not his only superiority, but the work he is able to do with the help of his intelligence, as well as with such hands, because of them he is able to live a happy, comfortable life ... able to make his self into an artificial existence and, compared to the status of his natural life, is able to provide it with a lot of luxury.\u201d A comprehensive review of Sir Syed\u2019s intellectual services is beyond the scope of this essay. However, we must admit that he was the first Indian Muslim thinker to explain changes in the world and human society in terms of the laws of motion of society itself and its creation. He did not include the intent or desire of any supernatural force.\n\nA photocopy of the front page of the first issue of Tehzeeb-ul-Akhlaq, dated Shawwal 1, 1287 Hijri, corresponding to Dec 24, 1870 | Wikimedia Commons\n\n\nHIS OWN EVOLUTIONWhen Sir Syed was compiling the Aaeein-i-Akbari in 1848, and later when he was writing Asar-us-Sanadid, Mirza Asadullah Khan Ghalib wrote asking what was of worth in the ancient texts. He desired to know why Sir Syed was engaged in nourishing the dead. He demanded Sir Syed to come out of worshipping the past and see the amazing scientific inventions the savants of the West had pioneered, such as the steam-powered ship and other machines, the electric wire, the matchstick and \u2014 even greater than these \u2014 a code, a law and a system. \u201cPut aside the Aaeein, and parley with me/ Open thine eyes in this old world/ And examine the life of the Englishmen/ Their style, their manner, their trade and their art,\u201d wrote Ghalib, greatly upsetting Sir Syed. Yet 20 years later, the very same Sir Syed set up the Scientific Society of Aligarh, earning the epithets of kafir and zindiq from representatives of the ancient ruins. This internal intellectual revolution was caused by the Western-style administration, lifestyle and education; had Western influence not been so dominant, perhaps Sir Syed would still be engaged with the ancient ruins.One of Sir Syed\u2019s ardent disciples, Maulana Altaf Hussain Hali, wrote in Hayat-i-Javed, his biography of the former, that at a time when Raja Ram Mohan Roy was demanding the English language and modern education, the Muslim ulema, by means of 8,000 signatures, proclaimed that the new infidel education was not needed; teaching Farsi and Arabic was enough. Sir Syed expressed his embarrassment at this organising of Muslims against modern education in which religious scholars played a prominent role. Sir Syed viewed the intellectual changes taking place at a level further than Ghalib. He understood that without engaging in the new form of scientific education, Indian Muslims would not only be left far behind, but might not even be able to maintain their identity. When he set up the Scientific Society \u2014 the basis of which was rationalist, or using reason \u2014 he was denounced as an Anglophile and an apologist for the colonial masters. From the fundamentalists came fatwas, while the nationalists called him a lackey who, in his passion for adopting new visions, had become an ally and propagandist of the British government.This objection was, to a great extent, true. Sir Syed was politically conservative, believing that India\u2019s security lay in British rule and instead of reconciling himself with India\u2019s national aspirations, he saw Muslims as a separate nation. But from a social perspective he was progressive. He ran a proper campaign to organise views in favour of modern ideas and against the worship of superstition. His own viewpoint had changed; from his 1848 essay Qaul-i-Mateen Dar Abtaal Harkat-i-Zameen in which he tried to refute the theory of the movement of the earth, his thought had adopted a scientific turn.In religion, his basic inference was that there could not be a contradiction in the Word and Work of God. He meant that nature could not be against the Word of God and if it appeared to us as such, we were definitely making a mistake somewhere in understanding the Word. That was why we needed to have commentary and exegeses of the Word of God on new lines.\n\nThe Muhammadan Anglo Oriental College was founded in 1877 as one of India\u2019s earliest residential educational institutions. It was affiliated first with the University of Calcutta and then with the University of Allahabad. By 1920 the college had grown and expanded into the Aligarh Muslim University | Dawn file photo\n\n\nConsequently, Sir Syed emphasised a new education of the Word (ilm-ul-kalaam). He opened educational institutions and schools, but \u2014 in what could be considered a flaw \u2014 kept Cambridge and Oxford as his models and gave the leadership of his institutions to the British. As a result, his policy for educational institutions was limited to being openly patronising of the British, which was undoubtedly a great defect in his scheme. But all this was part of his political thought. The second major flaw in Sir Syed\u2019s educational scheme was that he did not pay attention to the teaching of industry, handicrafts and technology, although a nation cannot progress economically without technical education. Until the 1930s and 1940s there was no arrangement at Aligarh for the teaching of technology, engineering and medicine. Even so, Sir Syed\u2019s role in our cultural and intellectual history has been undeniably unique. As for him being a British loyalist, that objection is not really significant anymore because he turned our intellectual current towards scientific thought, liberating us from a worship of superstition and religious preconceptions. His personality and intellectual steadfastness drew groups of enlightened people round him \u2014 even today we refer to them as the Sir Syed School. The man proved to be much more than an individual; he was a movement unto himself. OPPOSITIONIt has been observed above that Sir Syed was politically conservative and socially progressive. But the movement he started also had both political and social effects that led to reactions both against and in favour of the former. In the literary domain there was a notable reaction against him, for example, from the Lucknow school that included Pandit Ratan Nath Sarshar and Munshi Sajjad Hussain and which supported old values. The whole Awadh Punch group disfavoured him and his comrades. Some detractors composed poems calling him a new prophet of naturism: \u201cHe [Sir Syed] is the messenger of \u2018natural religion\u2019/ This natural religion was indeed \u2018revealed\u2019 to him/ He alone knows the secrets of the Book, because/ All the esoteric knowledge has been vouchsafed to him/ The evidence of his prophethood is visible to all/ It is visible in the pages of his Tahzeeb-ul-Akhlaq.\u201dOther notable opponents were the distinguished Pan-Islamist thinker and activist Jamaluddin Afghani and the eminent humorous Urdu poet Akbar Allahabadi. According to Allahabadi: \u201cWhat our respected Syed says is good/ Akbar agrees that it is sound and fair/ But most of those who head this modern school/ Neither believe in God, nor yet in prayer/ They say they do, but it is plain to see/ What they believe in is the powers that be.\u201dOne of Sir Syed\u2019s disciples, Deputy Nazeer Ahmad, bitterly satirised his mentor in the novel Ibn-ul-Waqt [The Opportunist]. Another disciple, Shibli Nomani, abandoned his mentor and founded another institution, the Dar-ul-Uloom Nadwa. Much was written against Hali\u2019s Muqqadima-i- Sher-o-Shairi that, \u201cit is trampled like the field of Panipat.\u201d Writers and poets split into two distinct groups, one favouring enlightened, progressive thought while the other favoured obscurantist and past-worshipping ideas. As the noted Urdu poet Ehsan Danish observed in his tribute, Sir Syed Ki Ruh Se [To Sir Syed\u2019s Spirit]: \u201cWhat was lit by the sparks within your chest/ That secretly burning fire could not grow cold until now/ Your foresight has granted lamps to the future/ Despite which the air is polluted by the smoke of the past until now.\u201d*All translations from the original Urdu are by Raza NaeemThe writer is president of the Progressive Writers Association in Lahore, a social scientist, book critic and award-winning translator and dramatic readerPublished in Dawn, Books & Authors, October 15th, 2017\n", "title": "ESSAY: THE MAN WHO BECAME A MOVEMENT", "author": "Raza Naeem"}, "1281215": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "SANTA CLARA: The first regular commercial flight in more than 50 years from the United States landed in Cuba on Wednesday, as the two nations took the latest step in their efforts to boost ties.

The Kurdistan regional government president, Massoud Barzani, has called Hero a traitor, while Kurds loyal to Talabani have accused Barzani of bringing another calamity upon their people.But this is only part of the story. According to US, Kurdish, Iraqi and European officials familiar with the diplomacy, the US special presidential envoy for the global coalition to counter the militant Islamic State group, Brett McGurk, came very close to a face-saving compromise between the Kurdistan regional government and Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi over the weekend before Abadi ordered his forces into Kirkuk.These officials said that the McGurk compromise would wrest Kurdish control of a military air base outside of Kirkuk known as K-1, where many US special operators are currently stationed. Between 2014 and this week, the K-1 base was secured by Kurdish Peshmerga forces. Like the Kurdish fighters stationed in Kirkuk and the surrounding oil fields, they took up these positions after the Iraqi army collapsed in the face of an IS surge in 2014.The US compromise would have offered a joint administration of the military base for both Kurds and Iraqis with a US general (agreed to by both sides) to settle disputes. The theory was this would have allowed Abadi to save face after last month\u2019s Kurdish independence referendum while avoiding the trauma of Iraqi forces taking over a multi-ethnic city that Kurds have long considered their Jerusalem.But much like the last-minute effort to persuade Kurdish leaders to back off the independence referendum, the US compromise did not convince Abadi to avert the military operation into Kirkuk. According to one Western diplomat who was working on the deal, McGurk asked Abadi for another day on Sunday, only a few hours before he ordered his forces into Kirkuk. But Abadi did not oblige.The Kirkuk crisis began to boil as early as October 13. That is when Abadi gave Kurdish leaders a 48-hour deadline to remove their forces from Kirkuk and the surrounding areas. This prompted members of both major Kurdish parties \u2014 including relatives of Talabani \u2014 to frantically call US and British officials to put pressure on Abadi to back off.By Saturday, the Kurdish leadership recognised it had a major problem. Both the Talabani faction and the faction loyal to the current Kurdistan regional government president met at Lake Dokan for a summit to discuss Abadi\u2019s warning and the potential compromise to stave off the Iraqi military operation. The location was important because it is a midway point between the regional capital of Irbil, which is traditionally loyal to the Barzani family, and Sulaymaniyah, the seat of power for the Talabani faction.But the Kurdish summit did not reach consensus on the US compromise. McGurk pleaded for more time with Abadi. But time ran out. By Sunday, Talabani\u2019s widow travelled back to Sulaymaniyah with most of her clan. Later in that day they cut the deal with Iran\u2019s Soleimani. The rest is history.Now the Kurds have lost their Jerusalem, as Iraqi forces approach what Kurds voted last month should eventually be their independent state\u2019s national borders.\u2014By arrangement with Bloomberg-The Washington PostPublished in Dawn, October 22nd, 2017\n", "title": "US failed to stave off Iraq\u2019s advance on the Kurds", "author": "Eli Lake"}, "1367962": {"date": "Updated November 03, 2017", "article": "KARACHI: Despite being a clean and cheaper source of energy, compressed natural gas (CNG) has been unable to beat the use of petrol, which continues to post sale and import records. Petrol imports hit a record high of 549,968 tonnes in September while its sales stood at 642,000 tonnes. Petrol sales reached their peak of 684,440 tonnes in August. In October, petrol imports were 447,128 tonnes while sales stood at 595,000 tonnes, an official of the Oil Companies Advisory Council (OCAC) said. Petrol off-take has been surging owing to rising sales of two- and four-wheelers. Imports of used cars of mostly small engine power are also boosting petrol demand. Petrol sales may remain robust in coming years following the arrival of car assemblers from South Korea and China and the planned rollout of new models by existing automakers. According to the OCAC official, petrol demand is likely to cross 9m tonnes by 2020-21. Amid growing petrol sales, CNG station owners claim that their fuel still costs less than petrol. Yet consumers seem to prefer petrol to CNG because of various reasons. The official in charge of the All Pakistan CNG Association (APCNGA) Sindh Zone, Shabbir Sulemanji, said the consumption of CNG in the province has declined to 80 million cubic feet per day (mmcfd) from 85mmcfd last year. People shifted to petrol without realising that CNG offers higher savings, he said. \u201cCNG still costs 30-32 per cent less than petrol,\u201d he said. The petrol price went up by Rs2.49 per litre on Nov 1. He added that the saving level would further rise in case petrol became costlier. Consumers in Sindh have witnessed a jump of over Rs10 per kilogram in the CNG rate since December 2016 when its price was de-regularised. Its price in Sindh hovers around Rs77-78 per kg. APCNGA former chairman Ghayas Paracha said using CNG costs 28pc less than using petrol. In Punjab, the CNG price hovers around Rs53-55 per litre. The use of CNG in Punjab touched the peak of 200mmcfd in 2011-12 when almost 2,400 pumps were operational. Its consumption declined to 9mmcfd in the first half of 2015. After the introduction of re-gasified liquefied natural gas (RLNG) in June 2015, the consumption of CNG in Punjab increased and now it hovers around 70mmcfd, he said. Currently, 900 of 2,400 CNG outlets in Punjab are in operation. But they have been witnessing only 3-4pc growth in sales for the last three to four months, Mr Paracha said. He claimed that one of the reasons for heavy smog in Punjab was the falling use of CNG. Only 900,000 vehicles, including ones used in public transport, now run on CNG against the 2013 estimate of 3.7m vehicles. He said Khyber Pakhtunkhwa has 537 CNG stations, which consume 81mmcfd of gas. Balochistan has 25 CNG stations where 3mmcfd of gas is used. He said the introduction of electronic fuel injection (EFI) engines in imported and locally assembled cars in the last eight years has also encouraged vehicle owners to use petrol. \u201cPetrol sales are still going strong in Punjab despite cheaper CNG,\u201d he said, adding that the CNG body is in talks with the government to allow the import of new technology kits that will push up CNG savings by 10pc. The CNG association has also requested the government to allow cylinders with a capacity of 32kg instead of 55kg. New kits and cylinder imports will be for EFI car engines. Due to the improved supply of CNG in Punjab, Pakistan\u2019s LNG imports in July-September swelled to $397m from $253m a year ago. Total LNG imports hit $1.3 billion in 2016-17 against $567m in 2015-16. The country\u2019s total car sales were 50,640 units in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, up from 41,405 units a year ago. Total car sales in 2016-17 surged to 185,781 units from 118,830 units in 2013-14, according to the Pakistan Automotive Manufacturers Association. Pakistan\u2019s total local bike production reached 2.4m units in 2016-17 from 2.1m units in 2015-16, figures compiled by the Engineering Development Board show. Bike dealers believe two-wheelers consume over 60pc of total petrol used in the country.

I am struck by the overly positive read-out of the engagement in Pakistan\u2019s media. True, these efforts signify that the threat of an imminent breakdown of ties in the wake of US President Trump\u2019s unveiling of his administration\u2019s Afghanistan strategy has been averted. Still, we need to temper expectations. Ties remain in trouble. This won\u2019t change unless common ground is found on issues that really matter. One-off successes like the freeing of the kidnapped American-Canadian couple will offer breathing space \u2014 no more. For some years, Pakistan-US ties have been marked by persistent demands on both sides for the other to do more. However, there was also a recognition that they won\u2019t get nearly as much as they were asking for, and, more importantly, that there weren\u2019t any extreme measures worth the cost to force the other side to concede. The US has continued to press the issue of the Haqqani network and Afghan Taliban sanctuaries. Yet, previous administrations shied away from coercive measures against Pakistan, seeing these options as cost-prohibitive. Pakistani officials remained paranoid about America\u2019s long-term regional intentions. Still, there was no serious effort to pursue a regional policy without some sort of partnership with the US.  The desire to continue engaging remains intact on both sides. But the US ask that Pakistan eliminate Afghan insurgent sanctuaries has not changed. This is now a one-point agenda. Every conversation about Pakistan\u2019s long-term importance is in cold storage; the talk in Washington of employing coercive measures is louder than ever. Further, the current US foreign policy orientation holds a strong preference for quick, tangible results. \nThere\u2019s no room for complacency in Pak-US ties.\nThe dynamic on Pakistan\u2019s side doesn\u2019t instil much confidence in the future of ties either. Pakistani officials sense the delicacy of the moment and thus will want to work out feasible concessions to the US that signal positive intent and avoid harsh action. Beyond this though, acquiescing fully to the US ask regarding the Haqqanis and Taliban has never been seen favourably. If anything, the current environment will likely reinforce the reluctance to bite the bullet. I sense consensus within Pakistani officialdom on two points: the new US strategy is seen as one aimed at defeating the Taliban on the battlefield rather than politically accommodating them; and that this approach is certain to work to Pakistan\u2019s disadvantage (and to India\u2019s advantage). Corollary: all-out support to the strategy will continue to be seen as self-defeating. Also, while the aura of unpredictability around US foreign policy in general is making decision-makers nervous, it is also forcing some within the system to argue that Pakistan must proactively plan for a minus-US scenario. If so, Pakistan\u2019s current engagement with the US may signify a buy-time approach. Meanwhile, one could expect Pakistan to proactively try and influence US strategy, most likely by pushing for a politics-first approach that seeks to accommodate the Taliban sooner rather than later. Here\u2019s the problem. The US is set to remain focused on the sanctuaries and opposes any proposal that may detract from this. Pakistan will be hoping to use its initial flexibility (for example, by actions such as freeing the hostages) to pull Washington away from its maximum ask. Yet, the Washington policy community may interpret Pakistan\u2019s flexibility as evidence that Trump\u2019s tough talk is working. The inclination would be to hunker down further. But desired results on the US\u2019s principal ask will still not be forthcoming. At the same time, Pakistan\u2019s political appetite to absorb public rebuke would be limited in an election year. Any propensity by the political elite to respond emotively will further em\u00ad\u00adpower the Washing\u00adton voices who want to see Pakistan punished. And as temperatures rise, those within the Pakistani system advocating a minus-US formula will gain traction. This is a recipe for disaster. For things to work out differently, both sides must acknowledge the elephant in the room: a mutual feeling that each side\u2019s preferred endgame in Afghanistan is unacceptable to the other. Pakistan believes the US is pursuing a \u2018basing\u2019 strategy that will leave its troops and bases in Afghanistan indefinitely. The goal, as internalised by the policy enclave, would be to keep the region (Pakistan, China, Russia, Iran) off-balance; India would gain further ground. The US is convinced that Pakistan continues to provide active support to Afghan insurgents to prevent US gains and keep the Taliban strong to counter India. But the US does not buy Pakistan\u2019s take on India; it sees the military as paranoid in this regard. These deep divergences are not easily reconciled. Yet, till they are, the ties will remain on the brink.

He\u2019s introduced musical concerts and movies again and is seen as the force behind the king\u2019s decision to grant women the right to drive as of next year.Opposition to the changes has so far been muted, but some critics of the prince have been detained. When social openings in the kingdom were taking place four decades ago, Sunni extremists opposed to the monarchy laid siege to Islam\u2019s holiest site in Makkah.Prince Mohammed\u2019s agenda is upending the ruling Al Saud\u2019s long-standing alliance with the kingdom\u2019s clerical establishment in favour of synchronising with a more cosmopolitan, global capitalism that appeals to international investors and maybe even non-Muslim tourists.The prince grabbed headlines in recent days by vowing a return to \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d. He also suggested that his father\u2019s generation had steered the country down a problematic path and that it was time to \u201cget rid of it\u201d.In his sweeping \u201cVision 2030\u201d plan to wean Saudi Arabia off of its near total dependence on petrodollars, Prince Mohammed laid out a vision for \u201ca tolerant country with Islam as its constitution and moderation as its method\u201d.Prince Mohammed, or MBS as he is widely known, used a rare public appearance on stage at a major investor conference in the capital, Riyadh, this week to drive home that message to a global audience.\u201cWe only want to go back to what we were: moderate Islam that is open to the world, open to all religions,\u201d he said in the ornate grand hall of the Ritz-Carlton. \u201cWe will not waste 30 years of our lives in dealing with extremist ideas. We will destroy them today.\u201d His remarks were met with applause and a front-page article in the Britain\u2019s Guardian newspaper. In expanded remarks to the paper, the 32-year-old prince said that successive Saudi monarchs \u201cdidn\u2019t know how to deal with\u201d Iran\u2019s 1979 revolution that brought to power a clerical Shia leadership still in place today.That same year Saudi rulers weathered a stunning blow: Sunni extremists laid siege to Islam\u2019s holiest site in Makkah for 15 days. The attack was carried out by militants opposed to social openings taking place at the time, seeing them as Western and un-Islamic.Indeed, Sunni extremists have used the intolerant views propagated by the ideology known as Wahhabism to justify violence against others. Wahhabism has governed life in Saudi Arabia since its foundation 85 years ago.The ruling Al Saud responded to the events of 1979 by empowering the state\u2019s ultraconservatives. To hedge the international appeal of Iran\u2019s Shia revolution, the government backed efforts to export the kingdom\u2019s foundational Wahhabi ideology abroad.To appease a sizeable conservative segment of the population at home, cinemas were shuttered, women were banned from appearing on state television and the religious police were emboldened.Much is now changing under the crown prince as he consolidates greater powers and prepares to inherit the throne.There are plans to build a Six Flags theme park and a semi-autonomous Red Sea tourist destination where the strict rules on women\u2019s dress will likely not apply. Females have greater access to sports, the powers of the once-feared religious police have been curtailed and restrictions on gender segregation are being eased.Unlike previous Saudi monarchs, such as King Abdullah who backed gradual and cautious openings, Prince Mohammed is moving quickly.More than half of Saudi Arabia\u2019s 20 million citizens are below the age of 25, meaning millions of young Saudis will be entering the workforce in the coming decade. The government is urgently trying to create more jobs and ward off the kinds of grievances that sparked uprisings in other Arab countries where unemployment is rampant and citizens have little say in government.The prince has to find solutions now for the problems he is set to inherit as monarch.\u201cWhat MBS is doing is a must requirement for any kind of economic reform. Economic reform requires a new Protestant ethic if you will, a new brand of Islam,\u201d said Maamoun Fandy, director of the London Global Strategy Institute.This new Saudi version of \u201cmoderate Islam\u201d can be understood as one that is amenable to economic reforms; it does not close shops at prayer time or banish women from public life, Fandy said.In other words, Saudi Arabia\u2019s economic reforms require social reforms to succeed.Buzz words like \u201creform\u201d, \u201ctransparency\u201d and \u201caccountability\u201d all used by the prince in his promotion of Vision 2030 do not, however, mean that Saudi Arabia is moving toward greater liberalism, democracy, pluralism or freedom of speech.The government does not grant licences to non-Muslim houses of worship, and limits those of its Shia Muslim citizens.The prince has also made no mention of human rights concerns. If anything, dozens of the prince\u2019s perceived critics have been detained in a warning to others who dare to speak out.Some of those arrested were seen as critics of his foreign policies, which include severing ties with Qatar, increasing tensions with Iran and overseeing air strikes in Yemen that have killed scores of civilians and drawn sharp condemnation from rights groups and some in Washington.Meanwhile, Prince Mohammed faces a Saudi public that remains religiously conservative. That means he still needs public support from the state\u2019s top clerics in order to position his reforms as Islamic and religiously permissible.These clerics, many of whom had spoken out in the past against women working and driving, appear unwilling or unable to publicly criticise the moves. In this absolute monarchy, the king holds final say on most matters and the public has shown it is welcoming the changes.\u2014APPublished in Dawn, October 29th, 2017\n", "title": "Saudi promise of \u2018moderate Islam\u2019 shifts power", "author": "Aya Batrawy"}, "1363393": {"date": "October 13, 2017", "article": "KARACHI: \u201cClimate change affects us all.

About hydropower, she said that Pakistan already produced 21,100MW of electricity through it, yet power here is expensive due to corrupt practices. \u201cIt is sad that there are no big investments in the energy sources mentioned while the government invests instead in coal power despite being a signatory to the Paris Agreement on Climate Change.

We test the water every six months to make sure that it is potable and irrigation is carried out through a combination of pipes and channels,\u201d he shared. \u201cIn the past 10 years we have experienced erratic weather patterns, shortage of water and electricity after which we decided to bring in the method of drip irrigation, mandatory mulching and reducing the land engaged in vegetable farming while shifting some land to fodder production and organically raising broilers, egg layers and goats, as well as convert to solar power as the primary source of energy,\u201d he said. Tofiq Pasha Mooraj, another organic farmer, then spoke about how badly the city and its people are affected by pollution and yet turn a blind eye to it. \u201cThere are cars and motorcycles emitting smoke and the mother sitting at the back of such a motorcycle with her little baby won\u2019t even think about covering his nose and mouth with her dupatta,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is untreated waste being channelled into the sea, there are polythene bags burning in the garbage, there is littering on the beaches but if I start gathering the trash, I am asked why I do it?\u201d he said. \u201cOur water will finish, the glaciers will melt and we will depend on rainwater, but no one cares to conserve water here.

officials responsible for organising an independence referendum, in the latest salvo by the central authorities over the disputed vote.The decision ratchets up pressure on Iraqi Kurdistan just over two weeks after voters in the autonomous region overwhelmingly backed independence in the non-binding ballot slammed as illegal by Baghdad.Acting on a request from the National Security Council headed by Iraq's prime minister, a court in east Baghdad issued warrants against the chairman of the vote's organising commission Hendren Saleh and two other members, Supreme Judicial Council spokesman Abdel Sattar Bayraqdar told AFP.It ruled that the three \u201corganised the referendum in contravention of a ruling by the Iraqi supreme court\u201d, which had found the vote unconstitutional and ordered it called off.The supreme court ruling came one week before the September 25 referendum, but the organisers went ahead with it regardless.In retaliation the central authorities have already severed ties between the region and the outside world by cutting international air links, while neighbouring Turkey and Iran have threatened to close their borders to oil exports.'Political decision'\nThe court's arrest order is likely to prove toothless as Baghdad's security forces do not operate inside Kurdistan, but it could stop the officials leaving the region.Vote commission chief Saleh shrugged off the ruling as of \u201cno importance\u201d, insisting that it was a purely \u201cpolitical decision\u201d.Even if it does prove symbolic, the move still represents the latest step in a broader onslaught designed to tighten the legal and financial screws on Arbil.The National Security Council on Monday said \u201ca list of names\u201d of Kurdish officials who helped organised the referendum had been compiled and \u201cjudicial measures have been taken against them\u201d.Iraq has also launched a probe into Kurdistan's lucrative oil revenues and pledged to expose \u201ccorrupt\u201d officials in the region who might have illegally monopolised the market.Baghdad \u2014 which has already demanded to take over Kurdistan's airports and borders \u2014 is looking to reclaim control over mobile phone companies in the region, including two of the largest providers in Iraq.The authorities also announced Tuesday that they are looking to reopen a key oil pipeline to Turkey that would rival a competing Kurdish export route.The Iraqi pipeline was cut off after the militant Islamic State (IS) group seized swathes of the country in 2014, halting a flow of oil to Turkey of up to 400,000 barrels a day.The angry dispute over the referendum \u2014 also rejected by the United States \u2014 is the latest twist in the decades-long movement by Iraq's Kurds to break away from Baghdad.Iraq is pushing Turkey and Iran \u2014 which both opposed the ballot over fears of fuelling demands from their own sizeable Kurdish communities \u2014 to close their border posts with Kurdistan and stop all trade with the region.Washington warned the referendum could \u201cincrease instability\u201d in the region and have an impact on the battle against IS, in which Kurdish fighters have been a key

Trotsky played a major role in the Bolsheviks\u2019 seizure of power in 1917 but was subsequently demonised as an \u201cenemy of the people\u201d due to his opposition to Joseph Stalin.The brilliant orator and Marxist theorist was forced into exile in 1929 and became an idol for the Western radical left.In 1940, Soviet secret police stabbed him with an ice pick in Mexico City on Stalin\u2019s orders.The eight-part biopic series titled Trotsky is set to air the first week of November.The title role is played by 45-year-old Konstantin Khabensky, one of Russia\u2019s most popular actors who starred in the hit fantasy movies Night Watch and Day Watch and also appeared in Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.\u2018Bloody role\u2019\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to be objective a hundred years later, but we tried to produce a series based on real events,\u201d the show\u2019s main producer Alexander Tsekalo told AFP in a phone interview. \u201cTrotsky played an important and bloody role in the Russian revolution.\u201d In the first episode seen by an AFP reporter, an elderly Trotsky reminisces from his Mexico home about the 1917 revolution and the ensuing civil war between Bolsheviks and their opponents.Trotsky believes he is talking to a Canadian journalist but in fact this is Spanish agent Ramon Mercader, sent by Stalin to assassinate him.The series also shows his early life in the city of Odessa in present-day Ukraine.A prison warden beats him in solitary confinement and abuses him for his Jewish origins, telling him: \u201cRevolutionaries and Jews do not understand the Russian nation.\u201d Curiously, Trotsky subsequently adopted the prison warden\u2019s surname to replace his birth name of Bronstein.The series often makes reference to the Jewish roots of Russian revolutionaries, but the director denies it could be seen in any way as anti-Semitic.\u201cI am Jewish. We are not deciding the Jewish question, we need to decide the Russian question,\u201d Tsekalo told AFP.The show largely presents him as a ruthlessly calculating mastermind, however.In one scene, he orders every tenth deserter from the Red Army to be shot and hands a peasant his watch \u2014 before going back to his train carriage to put on another golden watch.An unwanted centenary\nTsekalo insists there was no censorship at Channel One \u2014 notorious for its exclusively pro-Kremlin news coverage \u2014 saying there was \u201cnothing to censor\u201d.Nevertheless he said he discussed scenes and the \u201cmessage\u201d of the show with Ernst.The series\u2019 take on history is that \u201cpeople should not be forced to take to the streets and revolution always means blood\u201d, Tsekalo said.This follows the Kremlin line.With Vladimir Putin in power for nearly 18 years, all talk of revolution is taboo and the Russian state seems unwilling to mark the 1917 anniversary.\u201cThe state is not participating in marking the centenary, it is only watching,\u201d said Russian historian Nikita Petrov from Memorial rights group. \u201cThe Kremlin\u2019s message is that all revolutions are bad \u2014 and especially those financed from abroad.\u201dThe Kremlin has condemned the popular uprisings in neighbouring Ukraine and Georgia that it alleges were orchestrated by the West.The Trotsky series is keen to portray the West as playing a key role in the events of 1917 too.In a scene from Trotsky set in Paris in 1902, a German agent asks Russian-born Marxist theorist Alexander Parvus how much he thinks it would cost to destroy Russia with a revolution. \u201cA billion marks,\u201d Parvus replies with a smile. Tsekalo says it is a \u201cwell-documented fact\u201d that the West wanted to destroy Russia because it was \u201cbecoming a strong capitalist country\u201d.Published in Dawn, October 19th, 2017\n", "title": "\u2018Rock n\u2019 roll hero\u2019 Trotsky gets Russian biopic for 1917 anniversary", "author": "AFP"}, "1363931": {"date": "Updated October 15, 2017", "article": "AIN ISSA: The militant Islamic State (IS) group is on the verge of defeat in Raqqa, once its de facto capital in Syria, and the city may be cleared of the militants by Sunday (today) night, according to the Syrian Kurdish YPG militia. A local official said tribal elders were seeking to broker a deal under which remaining IS fighters, including foreigners, would leave the city, taking civilians with them as human shields. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), backed by air strikes and special forces from a US-led international coalition, have been battling since June to oust IS from Raqqa, a base that it had used to plan attacks against the West. \n100 militants have already surrendered arms\nThe retaking of Raqqa will be a major milestone in efforts to roll back the so-called \u201ccaliphate\u201d that IS declared in Syria and Iraq, where earlier this year it was driven from the city of Mosul. \u201cThe battles are continuing in Raqqa city,\u201d YPG spokesman Nouri Mahmoud, whose group dominates the SDF, said by telephone. \u201cDaesh [IS] is on the verge of being finished.

Its spokesman, Col Ryan Dillon, said the coalition\u2019s stance was that IS fighters must surrender unconditionally, but added that he could not comment on who would be in the convoy.

The coalition believed the arrangement would  \u201csave innocent lives and allow Syrian Democratic Forces and the coalition to focus on defeating Daesh terrorists in Raqqa with less risk of civilian casualties\u201d, it said. Omar Alloush, a member of the Raqqa Civil Council, set up to run Raqqa after it is freed from IS, said the 100 IS fighters who had already surrendered had been convinced to do so during talks with the tribal elders. \u201cOthers didn\u2019t surrender, so now they\u2019re looking for a plan where they (IS) leave and take civilian hostages with them to another place far from the city, and then release the civilians,\u201d he said in an interview in Ain Issa, north of Raqqa. The IS fighters would go to remaining territory held by the group in Syria, he said. The deal could happen soon. A tribal leader said he expected the evacuation to take place on Saturday or Sunday. A group that reports on Raqqa, \u201cRaqqa is being slaughtered silently\u201d, said on its Facebook page that dozens of buses had entered the city overnight from the countryside to the north. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a British-based organisation that reports on the war, said Syrian IS fighters and their families had already left the city, and buses had arrived to evacuate remaining foreign fighters and their families.Published in Dawn, October 15th, 2017\n", "title": "IS on verge of defeat in its Syrian bastion", "author": "Reuters"}, "1281404": {"date": "September 02, 2016", "article": "KARACHI: Hosts Sindh opened their campaign on a winning note when they humbled Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) in straight sets in the National Women\u2019s Volleyball Championship which commenced at the KPT Sports Complex on Thursday.Drawn in pool A, Sindh won the duel 25-22, 25-23 amidst applause from the crowd.The match also marked the formal inauguration of the four-day championship which concludes on Sunday.

New Delhi experiences suffocating smog every year around Diwali, when farmers in north India burn the stubble left behind after the harvest and revellers let off smoke-spewing firecrackers. The onset of winter aggravates the problem as the cooler air traps the pollutants, a phenomenon known as inversion. The Environment Pollution (Prevention and Control) Board, a statutory body, made the ruling as levels of PM2.5 pollutants in the air reached around 200 micrograms per cubic metre \u2014 eight times the World Health Organisation safe limit of 25. \u201cDifficult situations demand tough responses and solutions and Delhi is faced with a really difficult situation each winter when air pollution levels spiral out of control,\u201d said its chairman Bhure Lal in a statement. The Board said the city's Badarpur power plant, which has a capacity of around 700 megawatts, would be closed until March. The plant is due to shut down for good next July as India seeks to move away from heavily-polluting fossil fuels. It also banned the use of the privately-owned diesel generators that many rich households rely on during India's frequent power cuts. The measures follow a temporary ban on the sale of firecrackers in Delhi introduced earlier this month by the Supreme Court to ease the pollution levels. Last year, levels of PM2.5 \u2014 the fine particles linked to higher rates of chronic bronchitis, lung cancer and heart disease \u2014 soared to 778 in the days that followed Diwali, prompting the Supreme Court to warn of a public health emergency. Levels of PM2.5 between 301 and 500 are classified as \u201chazardous\u201d, while anything over 500 is beyond the official index. The Delhi government then shut schools for three days, banned all construction work for five days to curb dust levels and temporarily closed the Badarpur plant. A 2014 World Health Organisation survey of more than 1,600 cities ranked Delhi as the most polluted. India's notoriously poor air quality causes over a million premature deaths every year, according to a joint report by two US-based health research institutes earlier this year.\n", "title": "New Delhi shuts coal-fired power plant ahead of Diwali smog", "author": "AFP"}, "1364483": {"date": "October 18, 2017", "article": "KARACHI: Scholars and academicians believe the economic disparities which were present between different regions of the USSR ultimately led to its collapse in 1991.They were discussing their views at the Shaheed Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Institute of Science and Technology on Tuesday at a conference titled \u2018Centennial Year of Russian Revolution: 1917-2017\u2019 to discuss the impacts of the Russian Revolution, an event which is widely embraced as well as rejected. Among the several speakers was historian Dr Mubarak Ali, whose paper \u2018Ulema Aur Russi Inqilab\u2019 was also read out.\nScholars, academicians discuss impact of Russian Revolution\nThe paper cited various historical examples of Russian revolutions that had taken place, the news of which had reached the Indian subcontinent.One example which had surprised the Indians was Russia\u2019s defeat at the hands of Japan in 1905. However, not much was known to the people of the subcontinent about internal strife and revolts that had taken place within Russia.According to Dr Ali, it was after the start of World War I in 1914 in which Indian soldiers had also participated, the news that the Russian Revolution had toppled the ruling elite and established power reached the subcontinent. Scholar Dr Naazir Mehmood, when speaking about the\u00a0collapse of the USSR, shared his personal experience of having lived there and was an eyewitness to some of the events that had precipitated its collapse.\u00a0\u201cI landed in Moscow in 1984 while I was a student political activist inPakistan. It was a period when the Soviet power was at its height but the negative thing was, that in two years from 1982-84, three senior leaders died.\u201cI was present when Gorbachev came into power and initiated his reforms. My first impression was very positive.\u201dDr Mehmood narrated how everybody living in Moscow had been provided their basic rights like security, education, health, water and sanitation, infrastructure etc. However, things began to change once he travelled out of Moscow.\u201cI travelled across the Soviet Union and interacted with the common people without any restriction. Outside of Moscow, there was shortage of food items and other facilities.\u201cI found out that if Moscow was the brighter side of the socialist system, the people of Azerbaijan were complaining about being exploited.\u201cThe feelings of discontent and dissatisfaction were very much present. And under those circumstances a breath of fresh air came for the people when Gorbachev came into power,\u201d said Dr Mehmood.However, in retrospect, said Dr Mehmood, \u201cGorbachev did not have a very well-thought out plan; he demolished the system without having a replacement which is one of the major reasons why the USSR collapsed.\u201dThe rise of fascism did not leave artists untouched as they were not only directly impacted but were also inspired by it.This was put forward by\u00a0Dr Talat Ahmed from the University ofEdinburgh\u00a0who presented her topic on the \u2018Impact of Russian Revolution on contemporary art, literature, and theatre\u2019. She charted out extensively the specific period in the early 1930s in which writers and other intellectuals, especially the All-India Progressive Writers\u2019 Association, were deeply inspired by the political occurrences in Russia.\u00a0Writers from the Urdu canon, as well as those writing in Hindi literature, she said, were very much inspired by Marxism. \u201cSajjad Zaheer, founder of the Progressive Writers\u2019 Movement, was a Communist Party member. And this was no accident. Another notable name, though not part of the Communist Party, was novelist Mulk Raj Anand whose trajectory shows the influence of the events of 1917.\u201dDr\u00a0Ahmed also spoke about a\u00a0conference held in Moscow in 1934 which had laid out the credentials of what the policy on art and literature should look like. \u201cAt that particular conference, the keynote speech was Maxim Gorky\u2019s, where he spoke about how writers have to be engineers for the society they are going to be forming,\u201d she added.The conference was well-attended by students who eagerly put forth questions to the scholars.Published in Dawn, October 18th, 2017\n", "title": "\u2018Economic disparity across USSR led to its collapse\u2019", "author": "Haneen Rafi"}, "1367623": {"date": "November 01, 2017", "article": "ISLAMABAD: Out of 58 brands of paints used in homes across the country, 60pc were found to contain more than the recommended 90 particles per million (PPM) of lead, according to a report launched by an international organisation, IPEN on Tuesday.\u201cOf the paints sampled, 24 have dangerously high lead concentrations of above 10,000 PPM.

A legal adviser of the department presented the draft of the policy before the court and shared its salient features. He said the air monitoring system would be expanded under the smog policy besides enforcement of the Pollution Charge Rules of 2001 and environmental laws. He said with the upgrade of the central laboratory a checks and balance system would be introduced in collaboration with the Lahore Chamber of Commerce & Industries on industrial units emitting green house gas emissions. The adviser said that public awareness campaigns on all media regarding protective measures would be launched and also in schools where children were likely to suffer from smog related issues. Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah adjourned hearing till Nov 8 and directed the law officer to present the notification of the policy before the court.Advocate Sheraz Zaka had filed a public interest petition last year after a dense smog engulfed the city and affected a large number of citizens. He submitted that in 1952 the smog was faced by London, which thereafter implemented environmental laws and introduced the Clean Air Act of 1956. He said the coal industry in Britain was shut down by then British prime minister Margaret Thatcher in order to curb air and noise pollution. The lawyer said that the Punjab government had created a misconception that the smog transpired due to burning of agricultural waste in the Indian province of Punjab. He said the reason behind the smog was the lack of enforcement of environmental laws and dysfunctional central laboratory in Lahore. He argued that the government had not taken any adequate awareness measures amongst the public.Law officers: The Lahore High Court (LHC) on Friday directed the advocate general of Punjab to apprise the court of the procedure for the appointment of the law officers in the province.Chief Justice Syed Mansoor Ali Shah was hearing a petition moved by two lawyers who had challenged the appointment process for government\u2019s law officers and sought directions for it to formulate a mechanism for the purpose beyond political considerations. Advocate Ch Shoaib Saleem argued that the law officers had been appointed on political consideration and they remained loyal to the ruling government instead of the state. He said the government\u2019s lawyers drew salaries from the taxpayers\u2019 money but defended a specific political government. Mr Saleem referred to a recent incident wherein an additional advocate general, belonging to lawyers\u2019 wing of the PML-N, had slapped a police officer outside a court of Islamabad during hearing of the National Accountability Bureau references against the Sharif family. He said the conduct of the law officer, who was later sacked, had established that the law officers had been appointed merely on political grounds. The petitioner-lawyer said appointment mechanism of law officers was not regulated by any rules or law and it was totally dependent on the will of the executive head of the government. He pleaded that professionalism could be introduced in the law officers if some procedure was adopted for appointments at the Advocate General\u2019s office through proper advertisements, written tests or interviews. Opposing the petition, Additional Advocate General Anwaar Hussain argued that the chief minister of the province enjoyed discretionary powers under Article 140 of the Constitution to make appointments at the Advocate General\u2019s office. He said the Supreme Court had already decided a similar matter and upheld the powers of the executive. The chief justice deferred further hearing till Nov 13 and directed the AGP to apprise it of the mechanism for the recruitment of the law officers.Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2017\n", "title": "Smog policy in the works, LHC told", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter"}, "1364401": {"date": "Updated October 17, 2017", "article": "ISLAMABAD: A ladder rests against the wall of the Out Patient Department (OPD) at the Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) where workers are adding a fresh coat of paint to the building. In front of the building a weary woman sits on the ground leaning on her right hand for support, pain etched in every line of her face. All of a sudden, a shout rends the busy morning at Pims. An impassioned cry of: \u201cJeena ho ga, marna ho ga, dharna ho ga, dharna ho ga!\u201d (Life or death, the sit-in will continue.)   The cry for protest has come from a crowd of around 700 paramedics, doctors and support staff, who have been on strike for almost two weeks campaigning for their demand to separate Pims from the Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University (SZABMU).Inside the OPD, patients wait in queues \u2014 men in their queue and the women in theirs. But there is no one behind the counter who could tell them where to go for treatment. A few yards away from the OPD, a young man with a fractured leg lies on a stretcher surrounded by anxious attendants awaiting treatment.   The situation inside the Emergency Ward is even more precarious. A few nurses run from one patient to the other trying to keep up with the number of patients they have to treat.  The patients will have to wait till 11am before they can be treated. For the last two weeks, the protesters gather in front of the administration department at Pims early in the morning and register their protest before getting back to work at 11am.Pims was merged with SZAMBU in 2013 when the university was established through a law passed by the previous Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) government.The employees of Pims \u2014 one of the largest hospitals of the country and perhaps the only government-run state-of-the-art facility for patients in the entire northern region \u2014 say that this merger deprived them of basic rights such as gratuity, promotions, residence and other facilities offered to civil servants in federal departments.So they have decided to gather in front of their own \u2018Hyde Park\u2019 \u2014 the driveway in front of the Pims administration department \u2014 to demand a reversal of the decision. The protesters have given the government a deadline of Oct 18 to accept their demand for separation of the hospital from the university, and have threatened to escalate the protest if their demands are not met.  On this particular day, the protesters are charged up, rehearsing and bucking each other up to get ready for the final showdown.A dais has been set up for those who will make the speeches, while other staffers \u2014 some in uniform, others without \u2014 sit on chairs or stand in disciplined rows.

We are one in our demand.)Raising his voice above the cacophony of sloganeering, Manzar Shah, a senior leader of the association, announces that they will set up beds and workstations in open air to treat serious patients in the OPD but will not work inside the hospital until their demands are met.Doctor Asfandyar Khan, another leader, suggests that they need to take the strike up a notch. \u201cEvery department has stopped working except one, the sanitation workers. We have asked them to continue working because that will be the final phase of the strike.

Women stayed at home; they mended clothes, cooked food and bore the men healthy children. That was what they were brought up for and that was what they were happy with. But Vasilisa is not like other women. She roams through the forest by herself, hunts animals and forages for berries and herbs. She can outswim and outrun many men and many demons. She is not as attractive as the other village girls \u2014 too thin, too proud, too outspoken \u2014 and, for what it is in her world (and ours), she hates marriage. But, she is magical. She can see the Chyerti \u2014 spirits and magical creatures of Russian folklore. The domovoi, for example, is a small, bearded, brown, gnome-like spirit that protects her home from evil in return for bread and milk. The spirit of the horses, the vazila, is similar in appearance (except that it is more rugged) and tends to the equines in her stable, giving them food and grooming them when need be. Many more similar spirits live scattered throughout the forest near her house. She can talk to them and learn from them. But the belief in the Chyerti is waning; Christianity has begun taking over as the leading religion and its propaganda is spreading, mystifying the people of Rus\u2019 through the churches, icons and priests that have been steadily migrating into the cities and villages. Vasilisa\u2019s role is manifold: she labours to protect her family, her faith and herself \u2014 who she is and what she believes in \u2014 but there are enemies working against her, demons and humans, sometimes both being one and the same.\n\n\n\nBut \u2014 and this is the best part \u2014 Vasilisa\u2019s magic is not the convenient plot device of the lazy writer. She has no easy way out, no miracles to fix everything in her life, no one-shot kill for the demons. Throughout the book, the greater magic manifests in how she strives for her friends and her family through no strength but her own.The prose is written in a fresh, Maximalist style, one that I haven\u2019t enjoyed reading so much in a very long time. Arden places an adjective or an adverb at every place she is able and it works, because she doesn\u2019t just stuff them in there; each word is carefully selected to be thematically relevant, and bring every bit of this fantasy world alive: \u201cThe wind sobbed. The trees whispered. The sun was a live thing, throwing its hot arms over their [the farmers] necks.\u201d In Arden\u2019s hands Rus\u2019 isn\u2019t fiction; Rus\u2019 is a world that once was real, and is now real again. Arden\u2019s novel breathes and lives and so does the world in it.The story often crosses genres, spanning historical fiction, fantasy and feminist literature. And surprisingly, it has one of the best horror segments I\u2019ve read in over two years now, passages that robbed me of my sleep and made me hear and see things crying and crawling in the dark.I completed the last hundred pages in a single stretch of night, pulling myself out of Rus\u2019s well near the chill of dawn. I thought a lot in that moment, when it was quiet and only my own breathing filled my ears, and I hoped I would dream that night, and I did, and then I continued dreaming for the many days and the many nights that followed.Perhaps Malik was right.Pakistan is a country for men. Maybe it wasn\u2019t made that way, but it exists that way now. And while growing up is difficult for all of us, it is even more so for the women. It is easy for men to say that we make an effort to sympathise with women\u2019s pains, with what it feels like to be birthed and raised in a country of oppression, in the same way we try to sympathise with the minorities, the ill, the poor. It is easy to say that we can imagine how it feels to lose out on equal opportunity, to be dictated to, to be unable to walk the streets and public places as we wish, not be allowed education or live life in a dozen or more ways as we wish to and others do. It\u2019s easy to say, but so much more difficult to live. But Arden\u2019s brilliant masterpiece does its best to try and emulate that; the beautiful prose and structural excellence help the reader slip into the shoes of the protagonist, and then walk a mile and then two and then a thousand in them, all through her birth and up till the novel\u2019s climactic finale. Vasilisa\u2019s struggle helped me understand the everyday plight of the Pakistani woman, of having to fight to be yourself, in a much better manner than any other medium had so far.It would be surprising if Arden\u2019s debut is not nominated for the World Fantasy Award. With exceptional skills at building a world and an evocative imagination, The Bear and the Nightingale is a performance worth admiring, and its themes make it a significant work of fantasy fiction that everyone should read. With this being just her debut, it\u2019s exciting to see what Arden will conjure next.The reviewer is a student at the Lahore University of Management Sciences and an editor at the LUMS Business ReviewThe Bear and the\nNightingale\nBy Katherine Arden\nDel Rey, US\nISBN: 9781101885932\n322pp. Published in Dawn, Books & Authors, October 15th, 2017\n", "title": "FICTION: SECRETS IN THE WOODS", "author": "Uzair Shahed Islam"}, "1367406": {"date": "October 31, 2017", "article": "BAHAWALPUR: The district administration has launched a campaign to control smog and to educate people on hazards of smog and the ways to protect themselves.

The condition of the field, which has been controlled by IS for three years, was not clear following intense coalition and Russian air strikes.The SDF, with air support from the US-led coalition, said it captured the field in a \u201cswift and wide military operation.\u201d It said some militants have taken cover in oil company houses nearby, where clashes are underway. The US-led coalition confirmed the SDF had retaken the oil field.After coming under heavy fire from IS, pro-government forces retreated from the area around Al-Omar field, according to the Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights. The SDF said government forces were 3 kilometres away from the fields.Syrian troops, backed by Russian warplanes and Iranian-sponsored militias, have retaken nearly all of the provincial capital of Deir el-Zour, as well as the town of Mayadeen, another IS stronghold, which is across the Euphrates River from the Al-Omar field.The SDF focused their operations in rural Deir el-Zour on the eastern side of the river, and have already seized a major natural gas field and other smaller oil fields.IS captured Al-Omar in 2014, when the group swept across large areas in Syria and neighbouring Iraq. At the time, the field was estimated to produce around 9,000 barrels a day. Its current potential is unknown.Syria had proven oil reserves of 2.5 billion barrels as of 2015, giving it the largest supply among its neighbours after Iraq. The oil industry was a pillar of the Syrian economy before the conflict in 2011.As IS advanced in Syria, it seized control of most of Syria\u2019s oil fields and made petroleum a major earner for the militant group, which sold it on the black market to other insurgents and the Syrian government.Since the coalition began operations against IS in 2014, the militants\u2019 oil production has been reduced from a peak of approximately $50 million per month to currently less than $4 million, the coalition said in a statement.The government lost the Al-Omar field to other insurgents in 2013.Al-Manar TV, operated by Hezbollah, said the fight for Al-Omar was still underway and denied the SDF\u2019s claim to have captured it. The militant group fights alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad\u2019s forces.The official Syrian news agency said troops regained full control of Khosham, a town on the eastern side of the Euphrates River that they lost a day earlier to IS. The Observatory for Human Rights said parts of the town remain contested. It\u2019s not clear how Syrian troops will respond to the SDF\u2019s seizure of Al-Omar. Assad has vowed to eventually bring all of Syria back under government control.The two sides have accused each other of firing on their forces in Deir el-Zour province, but a rare face-to-face meeting of senior US and Russian military officers last month appeared to have calmed tensions.Syria observers have said the race between the US-backed fighters and the Russian- and Iranian-backed Syrian government forces is likely to be a source of direct confrontation in the absence of a political agreement.IS has suffered a series of major setbacks in recent months, including the loss of the Syrian city of Raqqa, once the extremists\u2019 self-styled capital, and the Iraqi city of Mosul. Most of the territory the group once held has been seized by an array of Syrian and Iraqi forces.An estimated 6,500 IS fighters remain in eastern Syria and western Iraq, many concentrated along the Euphrates River valley straddling the border, the US military said last week.Published in Dawn, October 23rd, 2017\n", "title": "US-backed forces take Syria\u2019s largest oil field from IS", "author": "AP"}, "1367244": {"date": "Updated October 30, 2017", "article": "Qatar's emir in an interview airing Sunday accused Saudi Arabia and its Arab allies of seeking to topple his government with its nearly five month old political and economic embargo of the tiny Gulf state.\"They want a regime change.

Naqeeb Ahmad Atal, a spokesman for the governor of Paktia province in eastern Afghanistan, said 120 militants were also killed in the strikes in Jani Khil, a strategically located district at a crossroads on a major route into Pakistan. But Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid denied the report as \u201cbaseless\u201d, saying the air strikes had killed only eight people. He said 48 members of the security forces had been killed in fighting in the district. Insurgents overran the centre of Jani Khil late on Friday, a significant success after they had stepped up attacks across Afghanistan in recent weeks. Afghan army spokesman Fazlkhuda Ibrahimkhil said US drones carried out Monday\u2019s air strikes, hitting fighters gathered in the town. Colonel Michael Lawhorn, director of public affairs for Afghanistan\u2019s Nato-led mission, confirmed that US forces had carried out attacks in support of Afghan forces on Monday. He declined to provide details while the fighting was going on. \u201cI can confirm that US forces conducted four air strikes,\u201d he said in an emailed statement. Another Afghan official said several military vehicles captured by the insurgents were also destroyed. One senior Afghan security official said about 1,200 fighters, most from the Haqqani network, were involved in last week\u2019s attack on Jani Khil. The involvement of Haqqani fighters, whose traditional stronghold has been in eastern Afghanistan, underscores the group\u2019s important role in Taliban military operations following the death of Taliban leader Mullah Akhtar Mansour in a US air strike in May. \u2014Reuters\nUnlike Mansour, new Taliban leader Mullah Haibatullah Akhundzada, a religious scholar, is not believed to have much command experience. His appointment has led many analysts to suggest a growing role for deputy leader Sirajuddin Haqqani, commander of the network named after his father, a veteran Islamist who battled Soviet forces during the 1980s and later sided with the Taliban. The Haqqani network has been known for kidnappings and high-profile attacks in cities but is rarely known to take part in big attacks on Afghan government positions. One of the commanders killed in the air strike had been district chief in Jani Khil for the Taliban. Another came from the Waziristan region on the Pakistani side of the border and was suspected of involvement in the killing of 42 construction workers in Jani Khil four years ago, Atal said. After a lull following Mansour\u2019s killing, there has been heavy fighting in the southern province of Helmand as well as in the area around Kunduz, the northern city that briefly fell to the Taliban last year.\nPublished in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "title": "Four Haqqani commanders killed in Afghanistan", "author": "Reuters"}, "1365501": {"date": "October 22, 2017", "article": "\n\n'Crocodile tears'\n\n\nYoung generation unsure\n\n\nCitizens mourning the murder of Daphne Caruana Galizia are calling for Malta's deeply-ingrained tribal politics to be put aside so the shaken island nation can begin healing its wounds.The initial shock at Monday's car bomb assassination is now turning into demands for a united front \u2500 with tens of thousands, party allegiance aside, expected at a national rally on Sunday demanding justice for the journalist.Caruana Galizia's anti-corruption blog shone a light into the murky corners of Maltese politics, rattling the Labour government \u2500 and, more recently, their sworn enemies in the Nationalist opposition.On Saturday, the government offered an award of 1 million euros for information leading to the arrest of those responsible, saying it was \u201cfully committed to solving the murder\u201d and to \u201cbringing those responsible to justice\u201d.\u201cAs we are seeing protests develop, we become aware of what has been fought for in terms of maintaining democracy,\u201d said Geraldine Spiteri, one of many paying her respects to Caruana Galizia at a growing tribute of flowers, candles and messages in Malta's capital Valletta.\u201cPeople in Malta politicise every issue,\u201d the lawyer said, citing the \u201cdeep-rooted tribal mentality, which is very worrying\u201d.\u201cBut certain things go beyond that.

The expert panel's report and tough remarks by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson overshadowed the announcement that UN-sponsored peace talks will resume next month. More than 87 people died on April 4 this year when sarin gas projectiles were fired into Khan Sheikhun, a rebel-held town in the Idlib province of northwestern Syria. Images of dead and dying victims, including young children, in the aftermath of the attack provoked global outrage and a US cruise missile strike on a regime air base. Syria and its ally Russia had suggested that a rebel weapon may have detonated on the ground but the UN panel confirmed Western intelligence reports that blamed the regime. \"The panel is confident that the Syrian Arab Republic is responsible for the release of sarin at Khan Sheikhun on 4 April 2017,\" the report, seen by AFP, says. The report will increase pressure on Assad's regime just as Washington, in the wake of battlefield victories against the militant Islamic State (IS) group, renews calls for him to step down. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson's comments to reporters came during a visit to Geneva in which he met UN envoy Staffan de Mistura, who is trying to convene a new round of peace talks next month. The secretary said US policy has not changed, but his remarks represented tougher language from an administration that had previously said Assad's fate is not a priority. \"We do not believe there is a future for the Assad regime, the Assad family,\" Tillerson said. \"I think I've said it on a number of occasions. The reign of the Assad family is coming to an end, and the only issue is how should that be brought about.\" Russia, which is running a parallel peace process with Iran and Turkey in a series of talks in the Kazakh capital Astana, reacted coolly to Tillerson's remarks. \"I think we should not pre-empt any future for anybody,\" said Moscow's UN ambassador Vassily Nebenzia, who on Tuesday had vetoed a US attempt to extend the gas attack probe. British Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UN panel's report had reached a \"clear conclusion\" and urged the \"international community to unite to hold Assad's regime accountable.\"\"I call on Russia to stop covering up for its abhorrent ally and keep its own commitment to ensure that chemical weapons are never used again,\" he said. Civil war\nDe Mistura hopes to convene an eighth round of Syrian peace talks between Assad's regime and an opposition coalition in Geneva from November 28. These will be focused on drafting a new constitution and holding UN-supervised elections in a country devastated by several overlapping bloody civil conflicts. Assad's regime has been saved by Russian and Iranian military intervention and he insists that he will not stand down in the face of what he regards as \"terrorist\" rebels. But Western capitals, the opposition and many of Syria's Arab neighbors hold Assad's forces responsible for the bulk of the 330,000 people who have died in the conflict. In addition to chemical weapons attacks against his own people, his government is accused of overseeing the large-scale torture and murder of civilian detainees. The previous US administration often said that Assad's days were numbered, but then president Barack Obama decided not to use force to punish his chemical weapons attacks. His successor, President Donald Trump, did order one missile strike on a Syrian air base in response to a chemical attack. But US policy has otherwise focused solely on the defeat of the Islamic State jihadist group, driving it out of its last bastions in eastern Syria's Euphrates valley. Tillerson said, however, that he hopes a way to oust Assad will \"emerge\" as part of de Mistura's UN-mediated talks. 'Moment of truth'\nHe argued that the UN Security Council resolution setting up the peace process already contains a procedure to hold elections that Washington does not think Assad can win. \"The only thing that changed is when this administration came into office, we took a view that it is not a prerequisite that Assad go before that process starts, rather the mechanism by which Assad departs will likely emerge from that process,\" he said. Earlier, de Mistura had told the UN Security Council that with the defeat of IS, the Syrian peace process had reached a \"moment of truth.\" \"We need to get the parties into real negotiations,\" the envoy said. Seven rounds of talks have achieved only incremental progress toward a political deal, with negotiations deadlocked over Assad's fate. The opposition insists any settlement must provide for a transition away from Assad's rule but, as government forces make gains, there is little likelihood of a breakthrough.\n", "title": "UN report blames gas attack on Syria's Assad regime", "author": "AFP"}, "1365813": {"date": "October 24, 2017", "article": "WASHINGTON: Prior to Sunday\u2019s ceremony awarding the 20th Mark Twain Prize for American Humour to David Letterman, the red-carpet question on everyone\u2019s minds had to be: to Trump or not to Trump?Each of the funny famous folks making their way down the red carpet at the Kennedy Centre before the big show had all been tasked with a tough job: roasting the 70-year-old king of late night at a time when the comedic landscape seems riddled with political punchlines packed with names like Trump and Harvey Weinstein.Would the night get serious or stay silly? It depended on who you asked.And it just so happened that the first big name to pose in front of the step-and-repeat was none other than Jimmy Kimmel, the late-night host whose sharp, politically minded monologues criticising the Cassidy-Graham health-care bill had one attendee branding him a \u2018hero\u2019.\u201cI don\u2019t know that I am making a difference,\u201d Kimmel said, \u201cbut I am going to try. I think if everybody adopts that philosophy we will actually make a difference.\u201dKimmel, a self-described Letterman \u201cstalker\u201d (he had the birthday cake and vanity number plate to prove it), kept his material for the night close to the vest but remained characteristically candid about the state of the country.\u201cI feel hopeful but not necessarily optimistic,\u201d said Kimmel, who planned to hightail it out of Washington after the show. So no quick sit-down with President Trump then?\u201cOh, I have a million questions for Donald Trump,\u201d Kimmel said. \u201cI\u2019d need like three hours with him.\u201dThe next few hours, though, could very well be a Trump-free zone.\u201cNo politics tonight,\u201d Martin Short said definitively. OK then.Comedian Jimmie Walker, who hired Letterman as a writer when the future late-night host first moved to Los Angeles, said the two don\u2019t ever talk politics.\n\nJIMMY Kimmel and his wife, Molly.\u2014The Washington Post\n\n\n\u201cDave is not a political guy,\u201d said Walker, one of the honouree\u2019s oldest industry pals. \u201cHe\u2019s not that type of cat.\u201dSenator Al Franken, agrees \u2014 sort of. \u201cNo Trump jokes,\u201d Franken said. \u201cThis is about David.\u201dBut whether Letterman himself is political or not? That\u2019s up for debate, according to Franken, who joked that he tried to get the former TV weatherman to run for office in Indiana (for what position, we don\u2019t know).\u201cHe\u2019s very interested in subjects like climate change,\u201d said Franken, who also saw parallels between Kimmel\u2019s political comedy and Letterman\u2019s, pointing to the former Late Show host\u2019s Youtube-able 9/11 monologue as proof.\u201c[Letterman\u2019s] someone who takes the 60 minutes they have on TV five nights a week very seriously,\u201d Franken added.Speaking of taking things seriously, finally, here\u2019s the man of the hour himself, making jokes about some serious stuff.When asked by a reporter on the red carpet how he feels about the current state of affairs in Washington, Letterman deadpans: \u201cI\u2019ll tell you something, if I can be candid \u2014 I\u2019m beginning to lose confidence in the Trump administration.\u201dBut seriously, folks: how exactly is Letterman, who famously hates being complimented, taking all this \u2014 the praise, the roasting, the fawning?\u201cIt\u2019s uncomfortable,\u201d Letterman said. \u201cSo far I\u2019m having a very nice time, but I\u2019m afraid that will all diminish when people are on stage telling lies about me, and then I\u2019ll start to wither and become uncomfortable and sweat through my shirt.\u201dSo why do it? Why show up in a tux and subject yourself to a barrage of glittery tributes from the likes of Steve Martin, Amy Schumer, and last year\u2019s Mark Twain recipient, Bill Murray ?He\u2019s doing it for his 13-year-old son, Harry, who is somewhere in the building.\u201cWith every breath I take, I\u2019m trying to impress him,\u201d Letterman said. \u201cAnd every now and then I feel like I have to let the young man know that, in fact, his father, not just a dope, but someone in addition to being a dope, was in show business.

And irrespective of the result of today\u2019s match, the visiting Sri Lankans will definitely be regarded as very special guests by the entire Pakistani nation. Though the visiting squad will be in Lahore for just above 24 hours for the match, the tremendous gesture displayed by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) and the members of the touring party will definitely win the hearts and minds of tens of millions of Pakistanis who have not watched top-level international cricket action at home for years. More than eight years ago \u2014 March 3, 2009 to be exact \u2014 the bus carrying the Sri Lankan cricket team to the Gaddafi Stadium for a Test match, was ambushed by heavily-armed terrorists near Liberty Square. The deadly assault besides taking the lives of eight Pakistanis including six policemen, injured six Sri Lankan cricketers. The courageous driver, Mehar Mohammad Khalil, showing timely presence of mind steered the bus to the stadium and helped save the lives of the tourists who were swiftly airlifted from the venue and were soon flown back to Sri Lanka.The horrific incident proved a huge disaster for Pakistan cricket for years to come \u2014 closing the doors of international contests on the country as various cricket boards and teams declined to tour citing security concerns.In 2015, minnows Zimbabwe visited Lahore for a short limited-overs international series. Earlier this year, the final of the domestic Pakistan Super League T20 tournament was also staged in Lahore without any trouble. And the visit by World XI, featuring a few star players of international repute, for three T20s last month also went smoothly, paving the way for the Sri Lankans agreeing to play the third T20 in the provincial capital.Learning lessons from the past, top-notch security arrangements are in place this time around. Of course, nobody in the security apparatus can afford to take even slightest of a chance.\u201cArmy, Rangers and Punjab Police are making their best efforts to make sure the match is held smoothly. And for this all possible arrangements are being made,\u201d DIG Operations Dr Haider Ashraf told reporters on Saturday.\n\nA CRICKET fan holds tickets for the third T20 International.\u2014AFP\n\n\n\u201cThe [visiting] Sri Lankan security officials are quite satisfied with the security arrangements [made for the T20 match] which are of international standards,\u201d he added.As far as the on-field action is concerned, Sunday\u2019s match has very much lost its significance after Pakistan edged past Sri Lanka by two wickets in the second match on Friday night to take an unbeatable 2-0 lead.After losing the first T20 by seven wickets, the Sri Lankans fought back well in the second game where they came close to winning it in a sensational fashion before Shadab Khan changed the scenario, notching up required 12 runs in a thrill-packed last over.The Sri Lankans who produced a much improved show in the  second clash can upset Pakistan \u2014 known for their complacency \u2014 to earn a consolation victory here. Sarfraz and his men, on the other hand, must be having another ideas as they look to record another clean sweep after blanking Sri Lanka 5-0 in the ODI rubber in the UAE.After both the T20 matches staged in Abu Dhabi remained low-scoring affairs, the roaring crowd at the Gaddafi Stadium will naturally expect a high-scoring match.Interestingly, the PCB has changed the starting time of the match to 6:00pm from 7:00pm mainly because of the dew factor.Lahore has experienced smog during the last few days. Therefore, heavy dew may not fall to significantly impact the playing conditions.In the first two matches, ball has clearly dominated bat. Therefore, batsmen from one team will need to show added confidence to come out as winners in this game.From Pakistan, seasoned Shoaib Malik (51) has been the top-scorer followed by Ahmed Shehzad (49), Mohammad Hafeez (39) and Sarfraz (28). Fast-improving pacer Hasan Ali is the pick of the bowlers taking five wickets for 54 while upcoming all-rounder Fahim Ashraf has also impressed with figures of four for 22.For Sri Lanka, Danushka Gunathilaka (69), who struck half-century in the second match is the top-scorer of the series followed by Sadeera Samaraw\u00adickrama (55).While two security officials from SLC are already in Lahore, ICC security consultant Sean Norris has also reached the city.

In Tests, Pakistan have handed out 229 caps, the latest being Haris Sohail. In One-day Internationals, Usman Khan was the 216th player to have received the privilege. Not all of them who were inducted made it, even though there were some outstanding talents among them. Consider Umer Akmal and Ahmed Shahzad, the latest to lose their places in the team. When they made their debuts, the great hope was that the two would anchor the next generation that was coming through. It wasn\u2019t to be. Both are now on the plate of katakut that will be swallowed whole, remembered only in passing as flavours of the moment or perhaps as analysts on the idiot box. But there were many others who lost their place despite needing more time to settle in or to sort their issues out. Below are seven batsmen who graced Pakistan cricket but were ushered out for one reason or the other, well before their Pakistan careers should have ended. \nUmer Akmal and Ahmed Shahzad have seemingly batted themselves out of contention but who were the other Pakistani batsmen whose promising careers were nipped in the bud? \nYASIR HAMEED\n\nYasir Hameed\n\n\nThere were murmurs that Yasir Hameed was addicted to naswar. Some believed the rumours, others didn\u2019t. But among the believers was the coach, Waqar Younis. Irked by having to constantly chide Hameed for his indulgences, Younis lost his cool when told that the batsman was now chewing naswar while on the crease.  The next time Hameed was padding up, Younis entered the dressing room and asked him to empty his pockets. Nothing there. Then the coach asked him to strip. Hameed did. Inside his undergarments was a packet of naswar, neatly stashed away from the prying eyes of his coach. That was the end of Yasir Hameed, a stylish batsman with a cover drive to die for but who became an advertisement for why professional sportsmen should stay away from drugs. ALI NAQVI\n\nAli Naqvi\n\n\nThe year was 1997 and South Africa had arrived in Pakistan for a tour that included three Test matches. Pakistan were searching for an opener and in came 20-year-old Ali Naqvi to partner skipper Saeed Anwar at the top of the order. Naqvi was so raw at the international level that the side match which got him selected was his first taste of first-class cricket in Pakistan (he had only played Grade-II cricket till then). The first match of the series was played in Rawalpindi. Pakistan handed debuts to three young men: Naqvi, Mohammad Ramzan and Azhar Mahmood. The first innings of the match was held together by two centuries, scored by Naqvi and Mahmood. While Mahmood batted supremely with the tail, Naqvi had been a constant as senior batmen around him came and went. The two ensured that Pakistan drew the match against a team led by Hansie Cronje and which boasted Alan Donald and Shaun Pollock in its bowling attack.But this sparkling beginning to his Test career proved to be a false start. He failed to score a 50 in the rest of the Test series, and although he was taken to tour Zimbabwe and South Africa in 1998, he didn\u2019t get a chance in the South African series and failed to impress in Zimbabwe. After playing five matches, Naqvi was dropped. He never returned to the team and another promising talent went to waste. MOHAMMAD WASIM\n\nMohammad Wasim\n\n\nThere was a time when the national selection committee was distributing Test caps like sweets, in the hopes of finding successors and backups to the batting line-up. Young Mohammad Wasim was the skipper of the Pakistan U-19 team, a technically correct batsman with style and elegance to boot. He got his chance against the visiting New Zealand team back in 1996, at the Gaddafi Stadium, after Wasim Akram pulled out of the match at the last minute. The 19-year-old\u2019s first outing bagged him a duck, but the second innings \u2014 a hundred in a losing cause \u2014 showcased the range of shots he could play in the \u2018V.\u2019 The on-drive in particular was divine as was his cover drive, both of which some believed were reminiscent of Zaheer Abbas. And while some of us believed that Pakistan\u2019s next big thing had been discovered, things didn\u2019t pan out that way. The 19-year-old got about a four-year look-in for the team, though never as a regular, but after 2000, he was summarily deemed not good enough. The numbers backed the selectors too: a Test average of just above 30 runs did not justify the bags of talent that Wasim had. His last Test was against Sri Lanka at Galle, where he scored a paltry 29 in what would become his last Test innings. Out of favour and perhaps out of luck too, Wasim headed to New Zealand in 2002 to play first-class cricket. With bags of runs under his belt, he was encouraged to return to Pakistan in 2005 so that he may be considered again for selection. But Inzamam-ul-Haq had become captain in 2003 and an air of religiosity now engulfed the team. The board and team management at the time believed that Wasim\u2019s dalliance with women fans and followers would inevitably drag the team into scandal. The captain\u2019s morality thus had the last laugh, depriving Pakistan of arguably the most aesthetic on-drives and cover drives since Zaheer Abbas graced the field.BASIT ALI\n\nBasit Ali\n\n\nHe was the second coming of Javed Miandad, while the original Miandad was still playing. On his day, he was as audacious as Miandad, could drag his team to victory from the jaws of defeat, and exasperated the opposition with his neat stroke-play. Ali was the like-for-like replacement for Miandad that Pakistan hoped would anchor the batting order for the next generation. But like many others, Ali scored a duck on his first outing against the West Indies in Port-of-Spain in 1993. The second innings saw Ali score a gritty 37 in a losing cause. Two more 50s followed in the remaining matches but over time, his inconsistency would go against him. But his debut series was also the one that arguably shaped his opinion about captain Wasim Akram as well as then vice-captain Waqar Younis. This was a time when there was no internet and news filtered through ever so slowly from other parts of the world. One morning, Pakistan woke up to news that Akram, Younis, fast-bowler Aqib Javed and leggie Mushtaq Ahmed had been arrested in Grenada. They were accompanied by two women tourists and a local man, on charges of \u201cbeing in possession of a controlled drug\u201d believed to be marijuana.Diplomatic intervention saved the Pakistanis of any major embarrassment but later on, the golden generation of Pakistan cricket became embroiled in match-fixing controversies. Ali eventually handed the following statement to a 1998 probe into match-fixing allegations: \u201cIt is absolutely false that I made some statement before Intikhab Alam confessing that I indulged in betting or match-fixing. It is also wrong that I retired because of the betting or match-fixing. As a matter of fact, circumstances created by the captain and the management were such that I had no option but to resign. Our team was divided into various groups after 1995. One comprising [Salim] Malik, Ijaz, Akram Raza, Ata-ur-Rehman and [Wasim] Akram and the other of Inzamam, myself, Mushtaq Ahmed and Waqar.\u201dBasit played his last Test in 1995 against New Zealand in New Zealand, and his last ODI in 1996 against South Africa in Sharjah. FAWAD ALAM\n\nFawad Alam\n\n\nDo you remember Graeme Hick? Yes the English batsman with 26 first-class centuries and widely considered to be a monster batsman at that level. Although Hick played 65 Test matches, his average of 31.32 was far below his 52.23 average at first-class level. The suspicion about him was that, as good a batsman as Hick was, he couldn\u2019t translate it on to international level because the standard of bowler at that level was a cut above the county level that he was used to. Many years later, in 2003, young Fawad Alam broke on to the first-class scene in Pakistan. His consistent scoring and handy left-arm spin would earn him a look-in at the national level in 2009, but as fate would have it, he never became a fixture in the squad let alone the team.In fact, under the captaincy of Misbah-ul-Haq when Pakistan\u2019s ODI team were struggling with their middle-order unable to rotate the strike, Alam remained in exile. Consider the talent that was introduced to the ODI team in Alam\u2019s place: Nasir Jamshed, Khalid Latif, Khurram Manzoor, Ahmed Shahzad, Umer Akmal, Umer Amin, Sohaib Maqsood, Mohammad Rizwan and Mohammad Nawaz to name a few. None of them could milk the bowlers for singles and doubles as effectively as Alam could. Perhaps it was Pakistan\u2019s desire to have boundary-hitters across their line-up. But it was a flawed strategy because often enough, the top would be wiped off by the opposition but not before the batsman had chewed up many overs in trying to get set. As a result, it came down to the likes of Misbah and Younis Khan to play the \u2018tuk-tuk\u2019 game to provide some respectability to the score. In the ODI game, in particular, Alam was and arguably still is a necessity. But his game isn\u2019t just restricted to ODIs, his Test average of 41.66 indicates solidity if not flamboyance. Alam was different to Graeme Hick in that he was translating his talent on to the international scene. And while Younis Khan in his brief stint as captain backed Alam, the selectors weren\u2019t convinced. Both his Test debut and his last Test came in the same year, 2009. His last Test, in New Zealand, was also Umer Amal\u2019s debut Test. The grapevine in the Karachi cricket circuit is that Alam\u2019s continued absence from the scene is because of his father \u2014 Tariq Alam made some friends in his playing days but seemingly made more enemies. Some also allege that a Karachi-Lahore rivalry is at play, with the Lahore-based PCB reluctant to hand over more Karachi-based players with responsibility. Notwithstanding the veracity of these claims, what we can all agree on is that one of Pakistan cricket\u2019s cult heroes has been hard done by. ASIM KAMAL\n\nAsim Kamal\n\n\nAt a time when Pakistan were struggling for some guts and consistency to the lower middle-order, they discovered Asim Kamal.  The year was 2003 and a gritty 99 on Test debut at the Gaddafi Stadium against South Africa proved that a special player had just entered the fray. He manoeuvred the field like Salim Malik, finding singles and doubles at will, and before the opposition knew it, Kamal was already batting on 30. The tour to India in 2005 confirmed that he was Pakistan\u2019s Wall. In a very short span of time, Kamal made a cult following. But Kamal was also a bit of a purist \u2014 given that he had established his credentials, he didn\u2019t take too kindly to the selectors putting him in the team for one series and dropping him the next. His last Test innings was also in Lahore, against England in 2005, where he scored a paltry five runs. A career average of 37.33 with no centuries in two years bear testament to another what-if story in Pakistan cricket. The worst part? So depressed was Kamal at his exclusion, at the Board, and at the system that he took a hiatus from cricket to rediscover his love for the game. He retired in 2015.ZULQARNAIN HAIDER\n\nZulqarnain Haider\n\n\nNever has a Pakistani hero gone out of limelight as quickly as Zulqarnain Haider did. The young wicketkeeper-batsman turned into a heartthrob overnight back in 2010 as he replaced Kamran Akmal in the line-up at Edgbaston and played a gritty innings of 88 in the second innings of his Test debut.The wicket-keeping mess seemed to have been resolved. But this was the summer of shame, as Pakistan cricket was buffeted by news that three of its superstars and match-winners were involved in fixing proceedings of a match. There was anxiety, there was fear, and there was suspicion. While Salman Butt, Mohammad Asif and Mohammad Amir were banned and put in jail, it was Haider whose career seemed to have nosedived the most.  Selectors believed he had more wicket-keeping potential than Kamran Akmal and stuck by him for a one-day series against South Africa in November. Midway through the series, however, Haider packed his bags, left the team hotel, and went to the United Kingdom in search of asylum. Nobody quite knows what transpired but the murmurs were that bookies had approached him and threatened him of dire consequences if he didn\u2019t relent. Much later, though, Haider said in an interview that he had \u201cspecific issues with a few players whom I won\u2019t like to name.\u201dHaider made his debut in the August of 2010. His international career was over in four months.The writer is a member of staff.

The offer was made by a six-member Chinese delegation led by Thomas Wang to City Mayor Wasim Akhtar during a meeting at his office on Sunday. Thomas Wang, who represents Chinese company Eco-Bus, has reportedly said that the company would also gift two such buses that would reach the city within two months. The buses are being sent here so that these could be tried and evaluated on the roads here and local staffers \u2014 drivers, mechanics and other related people \u2014 could be trained, he added. Briefing the media persons after the meeting, the mayor said that situation / condition of the public transport in the city was pathetic and if this project, which would be evaluated and examined, was materialised, it could solve the transport issues of Karachiites to a great extent. He said that two buses, which had been gifted by the Chinese company, would arrive in the city in a next few weeks so that these could be examined in the local conditions. He said neither these eco-friendly buses would cause the air pollution, nor would create noise pollution. The imported fossil fuel would also not be used so precious foreign exchange could also be saved, he added. He said that under the project over 500 stations would be established at different locations in the city where these buses could be charged. Once charged these buses could travel approximately 280 kilometres. He said that the Chinese company had offered various proposals: they could bring in the investment and operate the buses themselves, they could work in a joint venture \u2014 with the government or the local transport \u2014 or could just sell the buses. He said that all these proposals would be examined to see which one was more beneficial for the general public. The mayor said that all the mega cities around the globe had urban mass transit systems, but leave alone the mass transit system, here in the metropolis unfortunately did not exists a fully functional public transport system, owing to which people suffered and were forced to travel in buses and minibuses that were in dilapidated condition. He said that the Chinese company was in contact with the government. He said that he had assured the delegation that the civic agency would extend all assistance so that this vital eco-friendly project, which could solve the transport issues of, and provide relief to, the people, could be implemented, hopefully soon.Published in Dawn, October 30th, 2017\n", "title": "Chinese firm offers 2,000 electric buses for Karachi under $600m project", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter"}, "1362859": {"date": "October 10, 2017", "article": "\n\nSewage from these houses in G-7 flows into a nullah from these drain pipes. \u2014 White Star\n\n\nISLAMABAD: \u2018Islamabad the beautiful\u2019 is fast losing its beauty due to poor environment management. With its population having grown during the last two decades, the city is not receiving due attention from its managers. The capital city does not have a proper landfill site and garbage from the urban areas is being dumped in I-12, which is a residential sector. Most of the garbage from the rural areas goes into streams and the city\u2019s green belts are being used for parking and commercial activities.There is no audit of trees and the tree plantation campaign which the Capital Development Authority (CDA) \u2013 and now the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) \u2013 conduct each year in order to keep a check on plant mortality and the cutting of trees. \u201cIslamabad was designed for two million people and today, that is the number of people living in the city,\u201d said CDA\u2019s Director Master Planning, Zafar Iqbal Zafar during a briefing to a Senate committee on Thursday.According to the latest census, 9.7 million people live in the rural areas and 10.3 million in the urban areas. All of the rural areas are unplanned and there is no proper sewerage system or garbage collection system, which is affecting the environment of the city. Workshops in residential areas of the urban areas, such as those in the G-7 markaz which is known as Khada Market and encroachments in almost all markets of the city is also affecting the beauty of the city. The quality of air is being affected by the growth of industrial activities which has lead to an increase in smoke and dust.\u201cThe major polluters identified by CDA are steel furnaces operating in the industrial areas of sector I-9 and I-10. The authority has so far, identified nine polluting steel furnaces and formal complaints have already been lodged with the Pak-EPA being regulatory authority,\u201d reads a working paper which the CDA presented before the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet on Thursday. It says that following Supreme Court orders, the CDA has directed all steel furnaces to install scrubber units to control air emissions.\n\nThe picture shows the remains of trees chopped down in a greenbelt in Islamabad. \u2014 White Star\n\n\nThe scrubbers have been installed in most industrial units and harmful emissions into the air have been curtailed to a large extent, the paper says.However, the managements of steel mills keep the scrubbers off most of the time in order to reduce electricity bills, the documents say, and that the CDA has also assisted Pak-EPA in sealing three steel mills in the recent past including Zia Steel in I-10/3, Silk Root Steel Mill in I-9 and Mustehkam Steel Mill in I-9.A few weeks ago, the auditor general\u2019s office through a special audit also tried to inform the government about the serious environmental challenges that the federal capital was facing. It says green belts are being used for parking and commercial purposes in violation of the master plan. It says the green belt in G-5 is used for parking while that in F-9 is used for the Traffic Police Office.According to the audit, various departments are using green areas and other spaces along the Mauve Area, G-8, G-9 and G-10 for parking purposes. The report pointed out that CNG and petrol stations are established along the Kashmir Highway and that kiosks have been established on green belts in all sectors.The report says bus stands and shops have been established on green belts between IJP Road and I-10 and I-9 and seeks the attention of the city managers in regards to the regular fires in the Margalla Hills, though the CDA and MCI are yet to take action to minimise the chances of fire.Spread over 12,605 hectares, the Margalla Hills National Park witnesses dozens of fire incidents every year. During the five years between 2009 and 2014, the hills have faced over 146 fires, which damage forests and adds to air pollution in the federal capital among other adverse effects.\u201cNo preventive measure appeared to have been adopted by the CDA/MCI [to] mitigate the risk of fire and to reduce the instances of fire,\u201d the audit pointed out. The katchi abadis based on the beds of nullahs including those in G-7, G-8 and F-7 also add to the sewage problems and debris from demolished houses is also thrown into the nullahs.\u201cI do agree that there several environmental problems in the federal capital which have piled up during the last two decades but we are taking steps to bring improvement,\u201d said MCI\u2019s chief metropolitan officer Asad Mehboob Kayani.\u201cWe have imposed a complete ban on all types of unauthorised buildings in Islamabad and we are also working on establishing a permanent landfill site. We will also introduce a garbage collection system for all of Islamabad as currently, garbage is only collected in the urban areas,\u201d he said.DG Environment Dr Sulman Sheikh also said that steps are being taken to stop environment harming activities in Islamabad.According to sources in the environment directorate, corruption and nepotism is affecting the performance of the entire department where several corruption inquiries have been pending for years. They said officers responsible for the beautification of Islamabad and for the protection of the environment and forests do not have the qualifications to do so.\u201cYou will not believe that this directorate has around 4,000 employees if you visit the city and its parks,\u201d an officer of the MCI said, adding that at times, junior officers are given double charges if they do not have the right candidate and in case of shortage of manpower.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "title": "Islamabad fast losing its beauty due to poor environmental management", "author": "Kashif Abbasi"}, "1365457": {"date": "Updated October 22, 2017", "article": "JERUSALEM: The Israeli army attacked Syrian government artillery on Saturday after fire across the armistice line hit the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and warned it would step up such retaliation in the future.The Syrian government controls only part of the territory on the other side of the line, with the rest in the hands of rebel groups, one of them affiliated to the militant Islamic State (IS) group.But the Israeli army said it would retaliate against the Syrian army, regardless of who was responsible for any fire and of whether it was intentional or not.The Syrian defence ministry said that rebels had deliberately fired the rounds into Israeli-held territory to provoke the response against its forces.The Israeli army said it identified four hits from five rounds launched at the northern Golan.

Following the same pattern as the previous two solos in the series, the show looks at the artist\u2019s oeuvre from 2009 onwards, coupled with new works, to create a dialogue on the city\u2019s distinct character from the artist\u2019s perspective.Batool\u2019s work is political commentary through an \u2018urban\u2019 language and gets deep into the pulsating spirit of the city. She focuses on violence and terror, but goes beyond the cursory glance and dissects the emergence of the culture of fear that has quietly settled in and is subtly choking the city. As the artist says, \u201cI feel like most people look at [Lahore] in black and white instead of showing the nuances of the complexities of the city.\u201dShe achieves this perfectly through her piece \u2018Kahani eik shehr ki\u2019, which incorporates small postcard sized lenticular prints placed in a long straight line, creating an illusion of the artist taking us on a journey of roadsides with Lahore as her backdrop. She passes a mosque and the Lahore High Court with various vendors, policemen and lawyers outside. \nThe citizens, cars, rickshaws, containers and barricades come together to highlight the undertones of fear that exist in the everyday. \nFarida Batool goes beyond the cursory glance and dissects the emergence of the culture of fear that has quietly settled in and is subtly choking Lahore\n\nThe walk ends with a long wall covered with layers of graffiti. Batool\u2019s own words describe this part of the work perfectly, \u201cThe layered images are often related through the notion of memory or history, with\u00a0the\u00a0\u2018earlier\u2019\u00a0image being both partially erased but also constitutive of the\u00a0\u2018later\u2019 image in order to portray contrasting realities.\u201d This piece is able to say a lot about the city on multiple levels, giving us a complete sense of the nature of Lahore, its spirituality, its street life poised at a vulnerable edge, its layers of history contextualising the present. Her choice of lenticular printing is not just meant to create interesting illusions, however, but informs the narrative. \u201cIn a video the audience has to watch the events in a particular sequence, but with lenticular prints they have a choice between what they want to see and what they don\u2019t.\u201d This is most relevant in the piece \u2018Dekhna mana hai\u2019 where you feel the suffocation inflicted by the male gaze, but you have the power to choose to shut your eyes as you move across the piece. This control is an illusion in itself though, as a few eyes shut, others open, and you end up in the same frustrating struggle for control that is reality.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018World Cup 2016\u2019\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe gradual progression of fear in Pakistani society can be mapped by the increasingly visible measures taken to ensure \u2018security\u2019\u2014 which itself lend to the tense air of our cities. In a series of photographs, \u2018Oos sheher ka band darwaza\u2019, \u2018Oos sheher main mohabbat\u2019 and \u2018Oos sheher ki oonchi deewar\u2019, we see barbed wire isolated on a white background, and the whole frame covered by a red brick wall. Batool brings these signifiers of our underlying fear out of the background and into stark view. At the same time, the barbed wire gives the illusion of a heart shape with a string of gajras that are sold at traffic signals, which look dark, colourless and morbid but hint at the presence of love amongst the violence. It signals the existence of normal life amidst the chaos, or perhaps the ethereal omnipresence of danger amidst normal life.The most striking piece, however, that perfectly depicts our current human condition is \u2018World Cup 2016\u2019. Here we find the bloodshed and violence in the past year likened to a sport, where human life is a plaything, and news almost seems like a public contest for the inhumane. It is inspired by a video that was released of a couple of young boys kicking around the decapitated head of a policeman. It alludes to the appropriation of violence in our society and the death of our conscience as the consumption of brutal imagery becomes commonplace through social media and television.As a reaction to this Batool has prints of hands, arms and feet cut up and constructed into actual footballs that litter the floor. It looks like a surreal cross between a warzone of limbs, skin and hair strewn across the floor, and a playground of footballs. The fact that the audience is welcome to play with these balls makes it somewhat unnerving. What strikes hardest is the fact that among all the Karachi vs Lahore debates, the political urban landscapes of the cities could not be more similar. Batool\u2019s work could just as easily have been about Karachi in its essence, once visual intricacies and cultural specificities are overlooked. Three shows and one publication later we realize how essentially alike cities are, united in their experiences and concerns, but too divided over petty squabbles to be able to improve their own situation.\u2018Look at the city from here: by the high wall and closed gates\u2019 is being exhibited at the Gandhara Art-Space from August 18th till\u00a0September 16th, 2016.Published in Dawn, Sunday Magazine, August 4th, 2016\n", "title": "Exhibition: Fear and loathing in Lahore", "author": "Nimra Khan"}, "1367233": {"date": "October 30, 2017", "article": "\n\nThe writer is an environmental sustainability and climate expert, and a former practice manager of the World Bank\u2019s Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice.\n\n\nI AM not in the habit of following the Communist Party of China\u2019s Congress, but a Reuters news report from the sidelines of the 19th National Congress being held last week in Beijing caught my attention. It was the Chinese Minister of Environmental Protection, Li Ganjie, stating at a news conference that a strengthened environmental protection system would eventually benefit the country\u2019s economic development. He was responding to public expectations to improve air quality. He also told reporters \u201cWe are fully aware of the problems we are facing. Coal accounts for a high proportion of the overall energy mix.\u201d Also, \u201cwe have too many commodities transported by trucks. Some companies avoid emission-control measures. Some local governments are not enforcing measures from the central government.\u201d He said that China will strive to comply fully with its own air quality standards by 2035.Resolve, perseverance, and determination are words that I would use to describe the Chinese response to tackling air pollution. It was not always this way. The Chinese (and the world) had a very bad understanding of the effect of air pollution on health, as recently as 20 years ago. \nChina is a great example of a country acting in a focused way to reduce air pollution.\nInitially, acid rain (from poor air quality) affected crops and damaged buildings in the 1980s in China, becoming much more prevalent by the 1990s. This rang the alarm bells for the Chinese government to take air quality seriously. The impact of air quality on human health was only just being understood better at the time. Some remarkable efforts followed, including the Chinese putting in place strict sulphur-emissions regulations for their coal power plants, realising that this was an important cause of their pollution. Due to domestic demand, this created a huge market for flue gas desulphurization technology, which the Chinese took on, significantly reducing the global price for this technology. Indeed, according to an industry report, by 2009, China was operating 379,000 MW of scrubbers compared to only 130,000 MW in the US. China is also the largest supplier of many types of air pollution-control equipment and several Chinese companies are the world\u2019s leading suppliers of electrostatic precipitators.  The air quality problem has continued to get worse resulting in the Chinese putting in place even stricter standards for coal plant technology (such as super critical plants) and also investing in other renewable technologies. They also continue to cancel planned and under-construction coal power plants. For example, in January 2017, China cancelled 103 planned and under-construction coal power plants, amounting to 120 GW capacity (yes, gigawatts, ie 120,000 MW). Air quality management is a continuous battle in China, given the extent of locked-in coal-based power generation, keeping China on its toes \u2014 even more so these days as the world, and China\u2019s own citizens, better understand the effect of poor air quality on their health. To their great credit, the Chinese keep this issue front and centre on many fronts, including their active championing of the Paris Climate Agreement, shifting away from a position of highlighting their low carbon emissions per capita and the \u2018right\u2019 of all Chinese people to own a (petrol-powered) car. And it is not about their citizens losing out either, but rather about doing things differently.Indeed, China is shifting deliberately towards an electric car future for its citizens. In doing so, China puts itself clearly in a high moral position, advocating for a better quality of life for its own citizens, as well as a global champion. At the same time, Chinese industry continues to actively help bring down the cost of both air pollution-control technologies and certain renewable energy technologies, such as solar photovoltaic cells, making it a market leader. China is a great example of a country acting in a focused way to reduce air pollution, prompted by economic and health concerns, but it also shows how difficult it is to clean up if it is left too late. Today, with CPEC, Pakistan is poised for greater economic growth. Can\u2019t we also ask China for help on air quality, under the CPEC umbrella, so we can learn from them and avoid the problems that they face today? We might even be able to partner with Chinese industries to produce the pollution-control technologies we need to help control our own air quality.A few obvious areas on which to request help from China include the setting up of an air quality-monitoring system for our major cities, so we can actually monitor the pollution. We also need to strengthen the courses in our universities on air pollution, perhaps by partnering with the Chinese, so we can build Pakistani capacity to understand the problem, analyse the sources of pollution and develop the policies and measures to address it. Capacity building at the state and the national level of our government officials is important, so they can better develop and enforce appropriate environmental standards, which are the main policy tool for protecting human health, if applied properly. China consciously put in place training programmes, for not just its environment professionals, but for all municipal officials, on topics such as Strategic Environmental Assessment, to raise awareness of environmental issues. I know this, because I was one of the course lecturers, and the Chinese translated one of my books for teaching purposes. Learning about the different roles of the national government and the local governments in improving air quality would also be useful, given that in Pakistan, the 18th Amendment devolves the responsibility for environmental management to the provincial level, and rightly so, as they are closest to the ground. Just these four bits of primarily intellectual help from China could yield us a lot, such as a future in which we (and our children) could be breathing clean air.The World Health Organisation estimated that the mortality rate in Pakistan attributable to household and ambient pollution per 100,000 population was 87.2 in 2012. With a population of 177.9 million in 2012, that means that 155,000 deaths that year in Pakistan were attributable to indoor and outdoor air pollution alone. Compare this number with the 62,574 people who died in Pakistan from terrorist violence between 2003 and Oct 22, 2017, with the worst year on record as 2009, with 11,704 fatalities, according to the South Asia Terrorism Portal. When will we feel the pressure that it is time to act on air quality to protect the health (and life) of Pakistani citizens? It\u2019s time to leverage our special relationship with China to ask for help, in conjunction with CPEC, on a topic on which they are truly world experts. It would be foolish to let this opportunity pass us by.

People with eye and skin irritation as well as breathing problems started heading to hospitals. Later, it was discovered that this heavy thick curtain was not a natural occurrence, but smog. The reasons were several including trans-boundary smoke emitted from India due to stubble burning mixed with the smoke from firecrackers burst on Diwali. In images released by National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa), some crops were seen burning in Pakistan as well. Other reasons included the dust from several development projects and, of course, traffic congestion and burning of third-rate fuels by small industries. As the same time approaches this year, there isn\u2019t much information for the public or experts to analyse the situation. The Punjab Environment Protection Department (EPD) does not seem to be prepared for any emergency situation although officials claim to be working on it. Their air quality machines are not fully functional. EPD Labs Director Tauqeer Ahmed Qureshi says heavy duty machines needed for measuring particulate matter and noxious gases are not only highly sensitive, but also extremely expensive. \u201cWe have limited finance and human resources,\u201d he admits. \u201cOur last tender for the instruments was for Rs40 million per machine, while maintenance would cost Rs5 million every year per station.\u201d Even if the three instruments they have were working perfectly, he says, they could get readings only for two fixed areas every day. The city needs at least 15 to 20 stations. \u201cIn every location, there are so many factors: proximity of industries, traffic congestion, time of the year, wind direction, temperature, cloud cover etc. How can we give a daily mean reading in such a situation?\u201d he asks. The annual cost of just maintaining an air quality monitoring system is much more than the department\u2019s annual budget. The department\u2019s development budget for 2017-18 is Rs540 million, said Deputy Director (Development) Tahir. According to a joint research report, titled \u2018Shared Environmental Concerns between India and Pakistan\u2019, by environmental lawyer Ahmed Rafay Alam and Sanjay Upadhyay, the high cost of environmental sampling, which is the basis for any conviction before environmental tribunals, means that testing is seldom carried out. At the same time, innovative enforcement mechanisms such as pollution charges and self-monitoring rules have not yet been utilised. Meanwhile, the department is blamed for wasting the equipment it has. Ten years ago, the three machines were acquired from a Japanese firm. A decade later, these instruments have rusted, as the EPD admits itself. If they were used, as officials claim they were, no one knows the air quality readings received as they were never made public. \u201cWhatever the readings are, the public has a right to know,\u201d says Alam. \u201cIt is important for people to know the kind of air they are breathing.\u201d \u201cWe did not upload the results because sometimes knowledge can be an annoyance rather than benefit,\u201d justifies Tauqeer Qureshi. Meanwhile, to manage costs, he says a more compact German replacement has been found which costs around Rs15m per machine with Rs0.5m maintenance cost per annum for each machine. \u201cRight now the EPD has six stations -- Sahiwal, Sheikhupura, Faisalabad, Chakwal and Lahore, and one mobile. But they are all in the process of being set up,\u201d he adds. Qureshi also revealed that corruption has left the EPD in a bad state. \u201cIt was never revealed officially, but currently not a single factory is considered fit.\u201d \u201cThe meters should be up and running at all costs,\u201d Alam says. \u201cBut in the long term, other initiatives can also be taken, for example replacing carbon emitting industries, taking action where cars are concerned, etc.\u201d Coal emitting industries are expected to spread much more air pollution. Instead, biomass industries are a better option, researchers say. Alam\u2019s research report also indicates that besides political interest and increased budget support being integral to a solution, independent provincial frameworks for climatic and environmental issues are needed to be devised, related institutions staffed with trained people, and programmes managed and monitored. \u201cWe need to work out if it\u2019s only trans-boundary or just a drop in temperature worsening the situation. \nWithout proper data how can we make nuanced policies?\u201d he questioned.Published in Dawn, October 14th, 2017\n", "title": "Is Punjab ready to tackle smog this year?", "author": "Xari Jalil"}, "1367234": {"date": "Updated Nov 29, 2016 01:45am", "article": "Shafiquddin is lost in thought. He is sitting on a wooden bench at the corner of a potholed road in Benazir Colony, a part of Karachi\u2019s Orangi Town, staring absent-mindedly at everyone who walks by. The area appears poor, quiet and desolate. No industrial or commercial concerns operate here. Only a few scattered shops dot the streets. Local residents mostly stay within their own neighbourhood. No cars are seen driving around, no buses seen plying in Benazir Colony.  When Shafiquddin begins to talk, others around him shout him down. No matter what party runs the country, they say, the people of Orangi Town will always be neglected. He shrugs them off and continues: in 1974, he moved with his family to Karachi from Chittagong, Bangladesh, and found a job at a factory near the then recently developed Port Qasim seaport (as did many others who had migrated with him). He never had any trouble getting to work because his employer always sent buses to pick up the workers. Those days are long gone. The residents of Benazir Colony either have to walk for a couple of kilometres to get to a bus stand or they hail an autorickshaw to go to a nearby main road where they can find public buses. A few years ago, the provincial government started running buses that connected the colony with the rest of the city but those ran on Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) and have stopped operating since gas stocks have run out. Those who can find buses more frequently and easily than the residents of Benazir Colony have other complaints.  \n\nTraffic congestion near Nazimabad, Karachi | Tahir Jamal, White Star\n\n\nOn an unusually hot day last month, Maryam Zulfiqar, a 25-year-old student, is riding a bus to go to a private institute on Karachi\u2019s Tipu Sultan Road where she studies Arabic language. She left her home in Future Colony within the city\u2019s southeastern working-class area, Landhi, at 8 am. It normally takes her at least an hour \u2013 provided there are no traffic jams \u2013 to complete the 15-kilometre journey. At 5 pm, she will travel back: same route, same distance but in the opposite direction. Also read: We are destroying Karachi's greatest defense against ocean stormsZulfiqar is angry at the way bus drivers behave. They show very little patience, both in their driving and in dealing with passengers, and are not helpful when you make a complaint, she says. She is also unhappy about the lack of safety on buses and the unavailability of seats, especially for women, children and the elderly. \u201cSometimes so many people get on the bus that the men start pushing their way into the women\u2019s section,\u201d says Zulfiqar. In the past few years, she claims, bus owners have also reduced the number of seats reserved for women. \u201cWe find no place to sit and there is nobody to assist us,\u201d she says angrily. \u201cThe elderly and children are also not considered important passengers because the buses have to slow down to let them get on and off.\u201d Clara has mastered the art of negotiating these problems, perfected over years of travelling on public transport in Karachi. In her mid-fifties now, she climbs on to a bus on a recent weekday with an ageless swiftness and finds a seat in the women\u2019s section. She has been travelling on the same route for almost 17 years \u2014 taking a bus from Malir Cantt, close to the Jinnah International Airport, heading to the Pakistan Air Force Museum on Sharae Faisal where she works as a janitor.\nThere are, indeed, too many vehicles on the roads \u2014 even when the\nnumber of buses has decreased.\nClara, however, makes only part of her journey on the bus. She uses either an autorickshaw or a motorcycle rickshaw to travel the eight to 10 kilometres between her home and Malir Cantt. The time she requires for her two-way daily journey, about 37 kilometres long, depends, mostly, on the way the bus moves. \u201cIf [the driver] keeps slowing down at every small stop then we keep getting stuck in traffic which results in me reaching my destination in 45 minutes,\u201d she says. The bus that Clara takes every day picks up commuters from Mohammad Khan Colony in Orangi Town, located on the north-western part of Karachi, moves across the city diagonally and finally stops at Hazrat Bilal Colony, the largest neighbourhood in the Korangi area to the south-east. The bus makes stops at several major areas, including Nazimabad, Hassan Square, Karsaz, Drigh Road and Malir. It drives past the traffic and mayhem of Quaidabad, moves through Landhi and lurches towards its last stop in Korangi. Travelling this entire 31-kilometre route takes at least two hours. Clara is happy, though. \u201cIf it were not for this bus, how would I get to work?\u201d she asks with a smile. A mother of seven and a grandmother to \u201cnumerous grandchildren\u201d, she needs to keep working and feels blessed that the bus helps her do that, costing only 30-40 rupees for a round trip. Strikes and political unrest in the city highlight the importance of buses even further for commuters like Clara who then either have to stay home or use costlier means of transport such as autorickshaws and taxis. Transporters keep their vehicles off the roads in uncertain situations because Karachi has a long and tragic history of transport-related violence. A college girl\u2019s death in 1985 after she was hit by a bus and the subsequent riots, in which scores were killed and hundreds of vehicles set on fire, was the first instance. \n\nPassengers climb on to the sides of an overcrowded bus in Karachi | Tahir jamal, White star\n\n\nKarachi has an estimated population of nearly 24 million, according to a study done by the Japan International Corporation Agency (JICA) in 2012. The city has nearly 6,457 buses of various sizes operating on 150 routes. It also has 2,715 contract carriages, buses and luxury coaches that organisations and individuals can hire for temporary transportation, the study adds. And these are not the only modes of transport on the city\u2019s roads: minibuses, taxi cabs, autorickshaws, multiple-seat motorcycle rickshaws, private cars, motorcycles, school buses, private vans, ambulances, tankers, mini-trucks \u2014 anything that can run on an engine attached to wheels can be seen plying in Karachi. When architect and urban planner Arif Hasan and engineer Mansoor Raza came out with a study, Karachi: The Transport Crisis, in January 2015, one of their findings appeared counter-intuitive. In a city clogged with all different kinds of vehicles, they found the number of public transport buses having declined between 2011 and 2014 \u2014 from 22,313 to 12,399. Out of the buses that still exist, they write, only 9,527 are operative. Others remain off the road because of the CNG shortage, lack of funding and absence of security. \u201c \u2026 Due to this decline, people are forced to travel on the roofs of buses which is, strictly speaking, illegal and [they have to] wait at bus stops for long periods to get a ride,\u201d the study states.\n\nUtility relocation for a Bus Rapid Transit system in Karachi |Tahir Jamal, White Star\n\n\nKarachi: The Transport Crisis explores all the difficulties commuters face: \u201c \u2026 Excessive time spent in travelling and waiting for buses, travelling standing, travelling on bus rooftops, suffering injuries, being forced to leave the bus before reaching their destination for one reason or the other, harassment of women commuters, damage to attire, non-standardisation of bus fares, and a fear of the gas cylinder (which is placed within the bus) exploding.\u201d It also states that traffic is \u201cbecoming unmanageable and its congestion and the air and noise pollution [have] become detrimental to the health of its commuting public.\u201d There are, indeed, too many vehicles on the roads \u2014 even when the number of buses has decreased. According to the transport and communication department at the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation, there were around 3.127 million registered vehicles in Karachi by December 31, 2013. And this number is increasing at a staggering rate: 283,277 vehicles were registered only in 2013 out of which 71 per cent were motorcycles. In 2015 alone, 1,000 motorcycles were registered per day, says Hasan. While the number of vehicles on Karachi\u2019s roads is increasing by leaps and bounds, the number of traffic police personnel has remained stagnant. There are 3,200 policemen on traffic duty in the city when it needs an \u201cadditional 5,000 to regulate traffic\u201d according to the authors of Karachi: The Transport Crisis. Also read: The dismal state of public spaces in PakistanThe other problem arising out of the number of vehicles is environmental pollution. In theory, every vehicle has to get a fitness certificate from the Vehicular Emission Control Programme (VECP), started by the Sindh Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa). In practice, these certificates are either forged or procured by bribing government officials. The lack of coordination among government agencies, however, ensures that no one gets caught and punished for driving a vehicle without a fitness certificate. In any case, a strict enforcement of the fitness standards will create more problems than it will solve, at least in the short run. Quoted in Karachi: The Transport Crisis, a senior traffic police officer remarks: if the requirement for a fitness certificate \u201cis implemented, most public transport vehicles will be off the roads and the poor will suffer.\u201d\n\"This is a question of city planning. Not just of transport planning,\u201d\nsays Arif Hasan.\nThe JICA study insists the answer to all these problems is a system of transport that can help people transit from one part of the city en masse to another. Karachi, JICA's study says, is one of the few metropolitan cities in the world without a mass transit system. If it continues to expand at its current rate, it will become the second largest city in the world by 2030 with Tokyo, Japan, at number one \u2014 in other words, the largest city without a mass transit system. Everyone \u2013 from the officials at the mass transit department at Karachi\u2019s Civic Centre, which houses the offices of the city administration, to architects, urban planners, commuters and transporters \u2013 agrees that there is an \u201cimmediate\u201d need for Karachi to have a smooth, sustainable and feasible mass transit system. \n\nCommuters board overcrowded buses and autorickshaws along the route of Green Line in Karachi | Tahir Jamal, White Star\n\n\nThe Civic Centre opposite Hassan Square in Gulshan-e-Iqbal area is a concrete jungle. A large multi-storey complex consisting of interconnected buildings seems to be sagging under the weight of the problems of a rapidly growing city. Away from its main entrance, approached through congested alleys blocked by motorcycles and visitors, is the entrance to a building where Karachi\u2019s mass transit department is situated in a corner on the sixth floor.On February 3, 2016, this department made an announcement in newspapers that Karachi will soon have a mass transit system comprising a Green Line, an Orange Line, a Yellow Line and a Red Line \u2014 as part of a mass transit development plan JICA devised in 2012. The proposed system includes the construction of six Bus Rapid Transits (BRTs), two Metro Rapid Transits (MRTs) and the revival of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) which was originally established in 1964. Fazal Khatri, the director of the mass transit department since 2013, sits in his office, signing documents and answering his phone, which buzzes every few minutes. A man of nearly 35 years of experience and nearing retirement, Khatri says his department recently gave a presentation to Sindh Governor Dr Ishratul Ebad on the ongoing and proposed public transport projects. In order to ensure these projects benefit the people of the city, he says, public hearings have been organised to elicit the point of view of the \u201creal\u201d stakeholders. \u201cWe want to know what the public would do differently or if the current plan even suits them,\u201d Khatri says. \n\nPassengers sit on top of crowded buses near the construction site of the Orange Line in Karachi | Tahir Jamal, White Star\n\n\t\t\t\n\nTwo out of the six proposed BRTs are at early stages of implementation: utility relocation for the Orange Line has started in front of the Jinnah University for Women in North Nazimabad. Water pipes, gas lines and electric wires are being relocated to facilitate construction for the BRT which will run right in the centre of the existing roads. The shortest of the six proposed lines, the 2.2 kilometre Orange Line will begin near the Board Office in Nazimabad, heading northwest towards the Town Municipal Office in Orangi. The Sindh government will fund this entire line, estimated to cost 2.4 billion rupees and expected to benefit 50,000 people a day. The deadline for its completion is the end of 2016. The construction of a 17-kilometre elevated Green Line is also underway after Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif inaugurated it late last month. It starts at Guru Mandir \u2013 in the south of the city \u2013 and goes all the way to the K-Electric Power House in Surjani Town in North Karachi. The Green Line intersects the Orange Line near the Board Office and is expected to benefit 300,000 passengers every day. Funded entirely by the federal government, it is expected to cost 16.6 billion rupees. \n\"I don\u2019t think it is feasible to move all these people\u201d. Arif Hasan\nremains pessimistic about the KCR\u2019s revival.\nThe 26-kilometre long Yellow Line is in the planning stage and will be built under a public-private partnership. Khatri says an agreement will be signed soon with the China National Electric Company \u2013 the private partner in the project \u2013 which will be responsible for arranging 40 per cent of the funding. The Sindh government will provide the rest of the money. Khatri expects the project to be completed by 2018, though this looks ambitious given that construction work has not even started. The remaining projects under JICA's proposal have not entered the planning phase.  Even those which are well underway may fizzle out considering Karachi\u2019s troubled development history. Political interference and the unavailability of money, either together or separately, have been the most significant stumbling blocks in almost all previously failed public transport projects. And these two factors can still lead to a similar outcome. When asked about the progress of the mass transit projects being currently planned and built, Khatri says he sees no major obstacles in their way, at least for now. Everything, he says, is \u201cgoing smoothly.\u201d The KCR, too, once worked smoothly but then ran aground due to financial constraints. It became a full circle of 44 kilometres in 1970 and connected Karachi\u2019s four main work areas: the port, the Sindh Industrial and Trading Estate, the city\u2019s central commercial areas (such as Saddar) and the Landhi Industrial Area. In the mid-1980s, however, it started facing multiple problems, lack of maintenance being the most important of them. These problems had a negative impact on the quality of the services provided by the KCR and resulted in a reduction in the frequency of trains. Together, the two developments led to major financial losses which continued piling up for years, finally forcing the KCR to shut down in December 1999.\n\nA residential block near Jain Mandar in Lahore being demolished for Orange Line construction  | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nOn the other hand, political reasons foiled Karachi\u2019s initial attempts to develop a mass transit system. The Karachi Master Plan of 1975-1978 proposed the development of a light rail mass transit system along with \u201cupgrading the Circular Railway \u2026 pushing it into the suburbs through a number of spurs.\u201d The proposed system was to be \u201cpartly underground, partly elevated and partly at grade metro.\u201d All these plans, however, came to naught in 1977 after the removal of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto\u2019s government in a military coup, according to Karachi: The Transport Crisis. In 1990, the World Bank devised the Karachi Mass Transit Programme that preferred a bus rapid system over a rail-based mass transit system. The programme never took off because the politicians in power wanted a rail not a bus. No donors or contractors, however, showed any interest in what the politicians asked for. The third attempt to create a mass transit system was made in 2005 \u2013 with JICA\u2019s technical and financial support. It envisaged six BRTs linked to the KCR \u2013 essentially what is being implemented now after remaining on paper for more than a decade. One good thing to come out of it is a detailed study, published in 2012, which now serves as a master plan for all current and future public transport projects in Karachi. \n\nAn overhead bridge being constructed for the Orange Line project in Lahore | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nA family physician in Lahore, Dr Arif Hasan, opened his private clinic  opposite the historic Shalimar Gardens, in January 1981. Hasan Clinic has provided healthcare to more than 200 patients a day for 35 years. Some of his patients have been visiting his clinic since they were children. On January 9 this year, the Lahore Development Authority (LDA) knocked at Hasan Clinic\u2019s door and told Dr Hasan to vacate it in seven days to make way for the Orange Line Metro Train project under construction in different parts of Lahore. He thought of moving the court to delay, if not stop, his eviction. He did not get time for that. Also read: Nostalgia prevails in Lahore's royal quartersThe very next day at around noon, a contingent of police along with an LDA director showed up at the clinic and began removing equipment. Dr Hasan claims the government officials dragged out patients even when some of them were on intravenous drips and he lost equipment worth millions of rupees. The LDA officials razed the clinic in front of his eyes, along with many other adjacent businesses. The proprietors of some of those businesses were not even present; others say they had court orders against the demolition. \nThe government has been informing people about the impending eviction\nsince October last year, says the chief engineer of the Orange Line\nproject.\nAll of them insist the LDA violated the law while demolishing their businesses. The Land Acquisition Act of 1894, they say, necessitates that the government give a seven-day written eviction notice to the owner of a property to be acquired for a public project. No such notices were given to them \u2014 this is at least what the evicted people claim.\n\nResidents pack up their homes in Lahore due to the Orange Line construction in February 2016 | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\t\t\t\nWhen Israar Saeed, the chief engineer of the Orange Line project at the LDA, is asked about the demolition without notice of Hasan Clinic and its adjacent businesses he says simply that \u201cthis is not true.\u201d The government has been informing people about the impending eviction since October last year, he says. Other officials claim most of the demolished buildings were, indeed, encroachments on public land and, therefore, needed no prior notice for their demolition. Attiq Ahmed, an architect and urban designer, runs a think tank called Office of Conservation and Community Outreach in Lahore (OCCO) and has been working on conserving Lahore\u2019s architectural heritage for some years. He has made demographic maps of many historical areas of the city along the entire route of the Metro Bus. He insists that most buildings demolished near the Shalimar Gardens, including Hasan Clinic, were not encroachments. More than a month after the demolition, rubble still adorns the road in front of the Shalimar Gardens. Elsewhere in Lahore, the construction process for the 27.1-kilometre long and mostly elevated train track \u2013 which will link Dera Gujjran on the north-east of Lahore to Ali Town at the south-western end of the city \u2013 is leaving similar problems in its wake. Work on the project started in November 2015 and has picked up pace in recent weeks to meet the end of the year deadline for completion. To maintain a faster pace, government officials in many cases are cutting corners to acquire the required land \u2014 as the case of Hasan Clinic suggests. \u201cEveryone agrees that there is a need for a mass transit system in Lahore,\u201d says Ahmed. \u201cNobody is against that. But there is a better way to go about it.\u201d\n\nPeople vacate their homes near Jain Mandir in Lahore | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nThe Orange Line will pass by such historic sites as Chauburji, Anarkali, Jain Mandir, the General Post Office, the Supreme Court of Pakistan\u2019s Lahore registry, the Lahore High Court, Lakshmi Chowk and Lahore Railway Station. The track will have a 1.7-kilometre long \u2018semi-underground\u2019 section \u2013 crossing the gardens of the 155-year-old St Andrews Presbyterian Church, The Mall, the Lahore High Court and the Supreme Court registry \u2013 using what architects call \u2018cut and cover\u2019 technology. Despite being underground, this section \u201cwill destroy everything on the surface in its path\u201d according to documents OCCO has shared with the Herald.  \nNo new construction can happen within 200 feet of a site listed as\nprotected under these laws and there are 25 such sites located on the\ntrain\u2019s route.\nSome parts of the track also violate the National Antiquities Act 1975 and/or the Punjab Special Premises (Preservation) Ordinance 1985, the documents point out. No new construction can happen within 200 feet of a site listed as protected under these laws and there are 25 such sites located on the train\u2019s route, the documents add. In the case of the Shalimar Gardens, the World Heritage Convention 1972 mandates that the train line should be at least 250 feet away from the site \u2014 a provision not being followed. (Construction work around the protected sites has been halted by the Punjab High Court which is hearing multiple cases against the Orange Line project. According to OCCO, a heritage committee has now been formed to assess the impact of the construction on both Mughal and Colonial era monuments; a detailed report will then be presented.)   The way the government is handling these projects is not the only thing baffling architects, urban planners and community members across Lahore. They are also worried about an official disregard for technical advice: JICA's report had originally proposed that seven kilometres of the train track \u2013 from Chauburji to GT Road \u2013 should be underground. The government says going underground would have increased the cost of the project by 0.15 billion dollars \u2014 from 1.6 billion dollars to 1.75 billion dollars. \n\nImambargah torn down in Lahore | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nThose living in the buildings around Jain Mandir are packing up and leaving after having received compensation money for their properties, taken over by the government for construction of the train track. Kapurthala House and Bengali Building, both British-era structures, are being demolished. Many other newer structures around them, including shops, have already been razed. Many of those who have either already left the area, or are in the process of leaving, complain that they never received written notices as per the law for evacuating their properties. They say they were informed verbally. Others complain that the LDA officers visited them in person, in some cases even intimidating and threatening them. Saeed dismisses these allegations as baseless. \u201cWe published ads in newspapers so that people would be aware of the process,\u201d he says. \u201cWhenever there is a large-scale development project, people will protest and some will be affected.\u201d Also read: Why care about public art?That still does not alleviate the pain many are feeling at having to leave the places they had called home for decades.

Kashif Siddiq is one of them. He cries as his home near Kapurthala House is pulled down. A little further, a 110-year-old imambargah is being demolished. Nargis Zaidi, the imambargah\u2019s caretaker, does not know if compensation money will help her overcome her loss. \u201cWhat do you do when your identity and entire history is taken away from you?\u201d she asks. Saeed compares these complaints to what happened during the construction of the Metro Bus. There was a loud uproar about its impact on the city\u2019s landscape and environment, he says, \u201cbut now everyone is happy.\u201d This might be true, at least for the 380,000 or so people who travel every day by the Metro Bus which has been operational since early 2013. Its 27-kilometre track is uncluttered, the ticketing system is efficient and the neat and tidy buses run every two minutes (to keep things this way, though, the Punjab government massively subsidises the bus service, pumping four million rupees into it every day). \n\u201cWhat do you do when your identity and entire history is taken away\nfrom you?\u201d Says Nargis Zaidi, the imambargah\u2019s caretaker.\nMehvish Khadim, 21, travels daily from her home in Shahdara, in the north of Lahore, to work at a salon in Gulberg.

The Metro Bus has allowed many women from working-class areas to get jobs in posh neighbourhoods like Gulberg, she says. In his Upper Mall office, architect Kamil Khan Mumtaz maintains his composure while listening about all the real and supposed benefits of the Metro Bus and the Orange Line train being built. When he finally speaks, every word comes out of his mouth as an epigram. \u201cThe history, the heritage, the identity, the character of Lahore is gone,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat is the character of this city and its needs for urban transit?\u201d he asks and answers: \u201cThere is more than one mode of public transport and different modes are appropriate for different situations.\u201d\n\nGreen Line Metro bus passing through the Jain Mandir area in Lahore | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nMumtaz says JICA\u2019s master plan has tried to address these concerns. \u201cThis is a city where most of the population resides within a tight central area. [Whatever] most people in Lahore need is located within five kilometres from where they live. In such a situation, you don\u2019t build metro trains. This is crazy,\u201d he says, citing the JICA report. \u201cAnd you particularly don\u2019t build trains that move at four stories high.\u201d Mumtaz believes it makes more sense to clean up the traffic on the roads, to enforce traffic laws, to limit the number of motorcycles and autorickshaws and bring more buses on the roads so that everyone has access to public transport. \u201cYou don\u2019t need to construct anything; you don\u2019t need to demolish anything.\u201d Back in Old Anarkali, an elderly woman preparing to leave her home breaks down more than once. \u201cWe were refugees when we came here in 1947. It feels like we have become refugees once again,\u201d she says. \n\nThe site of a proposed Orange Line station near Shalimar Gardens | Azhar Jafferi, White Star\n\n\nShafiquddin retired over seven years ago and spends most of his waking time at the same spot on the road every day. He does not venture out of Benazir Colony unless circumstances force him to. When he is told about a mass transit public transport system being planned in Karachi that will connect Orangi to the rest of the city, those around him hope the project will bring energy and prosperity back to their otherwise isolated, rundown neighbourhood. The plan, unlike the ones in Lahore, envisages little demolition but it requires massive investment in creating the required physical infrastructure such as roads, flyovers and underpasses. There is neither time nor money for that, says architect Hasan. The cost of the six BRTs, including their rolling stock, comes to be about 160 billion rupees. \u201cWhere will this money come from?\u201d Hasan asks. \u201cMy fear is that the progress on the project will be very slow.\u201d \nPublic transport buses in Karachi have declined between 2011 and 2014\n\u2014 from 22,313 to 12,399\nEven with all the required money being somehow available, the plans will take a lot of time to materialise. \u201cDelhi took about a decade to build a mass transit system; Bangkok took about 16 years,\u201d he says. \u201cKarachi may build two BRTs in the next decade and a half. Those will benefit about three per cent of the city\u2019s population. What will happen to the rest of the city?\u201d he wonders. The problems surrounding the KCR, the central hub of the mass transit plans, are even more entrenched. Most importantly, it requires relocating 5,000 families and paying them a compensation that satisfies their relocation needs. Massive encroachment of the train track is another major problem. According to the Karachi Urban Transport Corporation, which is the entity responsible for the KCR revival, 20 per cent of the KCR track has been encroached upon by squatters and illegal occupants who will also require relocation. \n\nA construction site for Green Line in Karachi | Tahir Jamal, White Star\n\n\nGiven the populist political culture of Karachi, Hasan says, \u201cI don\u2019t think it is feasible to move all these people.\u201d He remains pessimistic about the KCR\u2019s revival. According to Hasan, Karachi immediately needs some transport system that is cheap and practical and that can be upgraded incrementally overtime. He suggests increasing the number of buses operating in the city and creating separate lanes for them. \u201cThe government can provide loans to bus operators to purchase more buses.\u201d He also wants the government to establish a training school for drivers and conductors to improve their skills and make them better aware of the need for following traffic laws. \u201cThis will bring great relief within two years,\u201d Hasan says. In a city where the mass transit department is a small part of the city\u2019s administration, building BRTs and reviving local railways is not just a matter of building elevated roads and removing encroachments. It will require coordination among many public and private entities; and a joint effort by many parts of the city administration, not just the transport-related entities which, so far, have been trying to plan and implement all the various projects single-handedly. \u201cThis is a question of city planning. Not just of transport planning,\u201d says Hasan. Khatri agrees. It is very difficult for a few of us to manage all the tasks, he says and adds that the Sindh Mass Transit Authority is being planned along the lines of the Punjab Metro Bus Authority. It, however, seems to be taking ages to materialise. Syed Mohammad Taha, the engineer in charge of the Karachi BRT corridors, is watching utility relocation work at the Jinnah University for Women on a crisp spring afternoon last month. When asked if this is the best way to have a public transport system in Karachi, he admits it is not. \u201cBut it is certainly a step forward,\u201d he says. \nThis was originally published in Herald's March 2016 issue.

Federal Minister for Inter-Provincial Coordina\u00adtion Mian Riaz Hussain Pirzada told reporters at the National Press Club in Islamabad on Thursday that Shahbaz Sharif should lead the party \u2014 apparently since Nawaz Sharif was facing trial in corruption cases. Editorial: Nawaz or Shahbaz?Differences between the two brothers and their heirs apparent \u2014 Maryam Nawaz and Hamza Shahbaz \u2014 became public knowledge when Hamza chose to air his concerns before media after he and his father failed to dissuade the elder Sharif and his daughter from adopting a policy of confrontation with institutions, particularly after the Supreme Court announced its verdict in the Panama Papers case ousting Nawaz Sharif from office. Now it appears that Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif has been cementing his position for an impending behind-the-scenes battle aimed at taking up the reins of the party, as he met long-time friend former interior minister Chaudhry Nisar Ali Khan on Friday to discuss party affairs with him. And one of the Punjab cabinet members, Raja Ashfaq Sarwar, conceded that the party lacked a clear direction and most of its members \u201care confused\u201d. The meeting between Chaudhry Nisar and Shahbaz Sharif was being seen as of great importance since both have been on the same page since the Panama Papers controversy emerged. \u201cBoth want Nawaz Sharif and Maryam Nawaz to avoid a clash with the army and the judiciary and face accountability without much complaint,\u201d a PML-N leader said. A close aide to Nawaz Sharif said that even if the court had restrained the former premier from holding the office of the party president the post might not have been given to Shahbaz Sharif on a platter. \u201cDo not rule out Maryam Nawaz\u2019s chances to don the cap of the party president in such a scenario,\u201d he said, adding that Shahbaz Sharif\u2019s role would remain confined to Punjab even after the next general elections. In a related development on Friday, Railways Minister Saad Rafique telephoned Mr Pirzada and asked him about his proposal to replace Nawaz Sharif with his brother. \u201cI told him [Saad Rafique] that what I had said is in the best interest of the party,\u201d Mr Pirzada said. There were, however, some PML-N politicians who remained unconvinced.Minister of State for Interior Affairs Talal Chaudhry said there could be a difference of opinion in the party but \u201cthere is one leader in the PML-N and he is Nawaz Sharif\u201d. Had anyone asked Shahbaz Sharif if he was interested in becoming the president of the party, he raised the question. \u201cSimilar ideas were floated during the Musharraf regime,\u201d Mr Chaudhry said, adding that after Nawaz Sharif, his brother was the most senior leader in the party and he was always there to rescue the party when such a time came. \u2018Lost\u2019 lawmakers meet\nThe situation has left the party\u2019s parliamentarians worried. They want Nawaz Sharif to give them a \u2018clear road map\u2019 going into 2018 elections and tell them who will lead them in the election campaign. They are having meetings in groups to share their growing concern about the future of the party and its direction. In background interviews, some PML-N legislators said it was the time both brothers (Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif) sat with the party men and told them how they would go into 2018 \u2014 with confrontation mode with the judiciary and the army or the party\u2019s development agenda. Besides, who will lead the party in the election campaign when Nawaz Sharif and his children are facing the graft cases. A few of the PML-N lawmakers endorsed Riaz Pirzada\u2019s criticism of the election of the party head and termed his proposal to replace Nawaz Sharif with his brother a \u2018workable solution\u2019. \u201cAt the moment most of us (parliamentarians) are confused and want Nawaz Sharif and Shahbaz Sharif to have a sitting with us to give us a clear direction leading to next year\u2019s election,\u201d Punjab Minister for Labour and Human Resource Raja Ashfaq Sarwar told Dawn. Mr Sarwar has recently attended a meeting of a group of over two-dozen MPAs, mostly from south Punjab, in Lahore in which the proposal of either forming a forward bloc to negotiate better terms with the Sharifs ahead of election or backing Shahbaz Sharif as party president was reportedly discussed. Answering a question, Mr Sarwar laughed off at the idea of forward bloc in the PML-N, particularly in Punjab, and clarified that he and some 20 MPAs were invited by MPA Shaukat Lalika at his residence, where they discussed growing unrest in the party because of having no \u2018future\u2019 direction. \u201cSimilarly whenever the party legislators meet these days they discuss the same things,\u201d Mr Sarwar said and added that Nawaz Sharif on his return next week would be requested to give them time and decide the future action plan. \u201cSo far the idea of replacing Mian sahib with Shahbaz Sharif is a non-issue in the party. Nawaz Sharif is important for us and he has vote bank. But the party men want to know how to move forward,\u201d he said. Mr Lalika told Dawn that he had hosted dinner for his uncle, Ashfaq Sarwar, who recently performed Haj. \u201cI also invited about three dozen other party MPAs to the feast. We discussed the party matters and the coming election.\u201d He said the party was united under the Sharif brothers. \u201cWe never demanded or discussed replacement of Mian sahib with Shahbaz Sharif,\u201d he said. Punjab government spokesman Malik Ahmad Khan said: \u201cThere has been consensus in the PML-N that Mian sahib should remain the party president as it is united under his leadership. The whole politics of the party revolves around him. However, it is the advice of the pragmatists to the party president to restrain the hawks to neutralise the \u201cPML-N G.T. Road political discourse and NA-120 by-poll campaign\u2019s strategy of confrontation. There should be no confrontation with institutions\u201d. About the concerns of the party legislators, Mr Ahmad said: \u201cOur party men want elections. Confrontational path may delay elections, they fear. And at the same time if they are not told about who will be candidate for the office of prime minister after the 2018 election, at least they should be told who will lead the election campaign,\u201d he said. Sheikh Rasheed foresees end of \u2018Sharif politics\u2019\nMeanwhile, Awami Muslim League (AML) president Sheikh Rashid Ahmed has predicted that the PML-N is a divided house and its parliamentarians will leave the \u201cPakistan Muslim League led by Nawaz Sharif\u201d in the coming days. \u201cEarlier, I said 40 parliamentarians are ready to leave the party but now I am sure that more than 70 will do so, including Prime Minister [Shahid Khaqan] Abbasi, Chaudhry Nisar and Saad Rafique,\u201d the AML chief claimed at a public meeting outside his residence Lal Haveli in Rawalpindi. The gathering was held to protest against the government for \u201ctrying to bring changes in Khatm-i-Nabuwwat laws\u201d. Sheikh Rasheed said, \u201cNext three months are very crucial for Pakistani politics and before March all the corrupt and the ruling elite of PML-N will be kicked out.\u201d He said the politics of the Sharif family would come to an end the day when the Hudaibya Paper Mills case, which pertains to the \u201cmother of all crime\u201d, would open.Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2017\n", "title": "PML-N in a bind over ex-PM\u2019s fate", "author": "Aamir Yasin | Zulqernain Tahir"}, "1363554": {"date": "Updated Oct 13, 2017 01:14pm", "article": "\n\nThe rescue operation\n\n\nTies to Al Qaeda a 'horrible coincidence'\n\n\nWho are Caitlan and Joshua?\n\n\nUS reaction: 'America being respected again'\n\n\nFive years after they were seized by a terrorist network in the mountains of Afghanistan, an American woman, her Canadian husband and their children \u2500 all three born in captivity \u2500 are free after a dramatic rescue orchestrated by the Pakistani and United States (US) governments.Caitlan Coleman, 31, and her husband Joshua Boyle, 33, had been in the captivity of terrorists since 2012. The couple had been kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan as tourists in October 2012. The woman was pregnant when abducted.They were allegedly held in Afghanistan by the Haqqani network before being 'shifted' across the border to Pakistan.The rescue operation\nThe hostages were recovered by the Pakistan Army in an operation near Kohat on the basis of \"actionable intelligence from US authorities\", according to a statement from the army's media wing.US officials did not confirm the details, but Inter-Services Public Relations said that \"US intelligence agencies had been tracking them and shared their shifting across to Pakistan on Oct 11, 2017, through the Kurram Agency border.\"The operation, which came after years of US pressure on Pakistan for assistance, unfolded quickly and ended with what some described a dangerous raid, a shootout and a captor's final, terrifying threat to \"kill the hostage\". Boyle suffered only a shrapnel wound, his family said. Sources told Dawn that the hostages had been recovered from a settled area of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) and that buzzing unmanned air vehicles (UAVs) had been seen in the skies of the Federally Administered Tribal Areas and KP for the past 10 days.The officials said that one of the kidnappers had been taken into custody while his two accomplices fled after an exchange of fire with the security forces.They said the vehicle carrying the hostages was intercepted near Kohat amid surveillance of drones in the area.\"One of the hostage-takers was injured in the exchange of fire near the town of Kohat,\" said an official on condition of anonymity as he was not authorised to talk to the media. Boyle and the high commissioner for Pakistan to Canada described a scene in which gunshots rang out as Boyle, his wife and their children were intercepted by security forces while being transported in the trunk of their captors' car. Boyle told his parents there was a shootout in which some of his captors were killed and said the last words he'd heard from the kidnappers were, \"kill the hostage\", his father, Patrick told reporters after speaking with his son. Joshua Boyle also told his father he'd been hit by shrapnel in the leg. Three intelligence officials said the confrontation happened near a road crossing in the Nawa Kili area of Kohat.Pakistan's High Commissioner to Canada Tariq Azim Khan said, \"We know there was a shootout and Pakistani commandos carried out an attack and rescued the hostages.\"The ISPR blamed a \"terrorist outfit\" for the kidnapping, but did not name it in its statement. However, US intelligence officials believe that the Haqqani network was behind the abduction.Residents in Kohat and adjacent tribal areas said drones had been seen flying over the areas for the past 10 days. They were also flying over Hangu district and Kurram and North Waziristan agencies, according to locals.This is reportedly the deepest ever activity of drones inside Pakistani territory.Media reports that the drones had appeared in the sky over Kohat on Wednesday created panic among residents. Following the movement of drones, Pakistan Air Force planes and helicopter gunships appeared to intercept \u2018foreign objects\u2019.According to the army, the family is \"being repatriated to the country of their origin.\" But as of Thursday evening, it was not known when they would return to North America. They were together in a safe, undisclosed location in Pakistan, according to a US national security official, who wasn't authorised to discuss the case publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity. Ties to Al Qaeda a 'horrible coincidence'\nA US military official said a military hostage team had flown to Pakistan on Wednesday, prepared to fly the family out. The team did a preliminary health assessment and had a transport plane ready to go.But sometime after daybreak there, as the family members were walking to the plane, Boyle said he did not want to board. Boyle's father said his son did not want to board the plane because it was headed to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan, a site associated with accusations of prisoner abuse, and Boyle was philosophically opposed to going to there. Another US official said Boyle was nervous about being in \"custody\" given his family ties. He was once married to Zaynab Khadr, the older sister of former Guantanamo Bay detainee Omar Khadr and the daughter of a senior Al Qaeda financier. Her father, the late Ahmed Said Khadr, and the family stayed with Osama bin Laden briefly when Omar Khadr was a boy. The Canadian-born Omar Khadr was 15 when he was captured by US troops following a firefight and was taken to the US detention centre at Guantanamo Bay. Officials had discounted any link between that background and Boyle's capture, with one official describing it in 2014 as a \"horrible coincidence\". The US Justice Department said neither Boyle nor Coleman are wanted for any federal crime. The couple told US officials and their families they wanted to fly commercially to Canada.Boyle's father called the rescue a \"miracle\". Coleman's parents, Jim and Lyn Coleman, meanwhile, posted a statement on the door of their Pennsylvania home expressing joy. Lyn Coleman said \"I am in a state of euphoria, stunned and overjoyed,\" in an interview with ABC News.The developments came rapidly Wednesday afternoon nearly five years to the day after Coleman and Boyle lost touch with their families while travelling in a mountainous region near Kabul. Who are Caitlan and Joshua?\nShe was a small-town American woman yearning to explore. He once married a Guantanamo inmate\u2019s sister.Together they backpacked into war-ravaged Afghanistan, were taken hostage, and bore three children in captivity before their shock rescue.Coleman and Boyle\u2019s ordeal has remained largely a mystery, and one of the strangest hostage dramas since the day they were abducted.Five years after their capture, during which a 2016 hostage video showed Coleman pleading for an end to \"the Kafkaesque nightmare in which we find ourselves,\" the family is free.But little is known of the couple\u2019s reasons for striking out to Central Asia in the first place, with seemingly no endgame in focus.Their adventures took them to Kyrgyzstan, Kazakhstan, and Tajikistan, where they befriended locals in the countryside and joined caravans with other travellers. They sent postcards home chronicling their adventures.\"Only God knows exactly where it will lead or what all can be accomplished, seen, experienced or learned while we travel,\" Caitlan wrote in an email in July 2012 on the eve of her departure, according to Caitlan\u2019s neighbour Holly Otterbein, who wrote an article for Philadelphia magazine last year. \"So we put ourselves in His hands.\"Coleman grew up in the tiny community of Stewartstown, Pennsylvania. She is described by friends as soft-spoken, individualistic, an all-American sweetheart.In September 2012, one month before her capture, she wrote to friends to describe her joy in \"getting to know some of the most unique, quirky people I have ever met, and learning from them. It really gives you a different perspective on the world\".Coleman was several months pregnant at the time the couple were kidnapped \u2500 \"naive,\" but also \"adventuresome\" with a humanitarian bent, her father James told The Associated Press in 2012. Boyle was raised in Ottawa. They met as teenagers online, shared a passion for science fiction and the Star Wars movies, and got married in 2011 during a trip to Central America, according to Canadian press reports.\"How did a self-described \u2018pacifist Mennonite hippy-child\u2019 from rural Canada end up as a prisoner of the most brutal terrorist group in Central Asia? Not even his family is sure,\" Boyle\u2019s friend Alex Edwards wrote in a blog post in 2015.\"He was a rebel, an iconoclast, a Robin Hood. I hope he still is.\"Boyle was drawn to politics, extremist personalities, and justice issues surrounding the detentions in Guantanamo, according to Edwards.Boyle\u2019s parents were given occasional glimpses of their son\u2019s and daughter-in-law\u2019s life in captivity, in correspondence delivered through intermediaries.Coleman's parents last had a conversation with their son-in-law on Oct 8, 2012, via an email sent from an internet cafe he'd described as being in an \u201cunsafe\u201d part of Afghanistan. From then on, there were only desperate, hostage videos released by their captors and hand-scrawled letters mailed home. \"I pray to hear from you again, to hear how everybody is doing,\" read one letter the parents shared with the online Circa News service in July 2016, in which Coleman revealed she'd given birth to a second child in captivity. It's unclear whether they knew she'd had a third. Boyle's parents say their son told them in a letter that he and his wife pretended to the children that their signs of captivity were part of a game being played with guards. Boyle recounted in one letter how he helped deliver his second son in the darkness, with a flashlight between his teeth.\"Ta-da!\" he wrote to his parents, according to a September 2016 report in the Toronto Star. \"The astonished captors were good and brought all our post-partum needs, so he is now fat and healthy, praise God.\"In two videos from last December and January that the hostages\u2019 families shared this year, the couple\u2019s two sons appear healthy but dishevelled.US reaction: 'America being respected again'\nUS President Donald Trump hailed the couple's freedom, and suggested the rescue was the result of his tougher diplomatic stance against Pakistan, which Washington has been pressuring over its support for some militant groups. \"The Pakistani government's cooperation is a sign that it is honouring America's wish that it do more to provide security in the region,\" Trump told reporters. \"They worked very hard on this, and I believe they're starting to respect the United States again,\" he said, adding that \"a lot\" of other nations were also showing greater deference to the US. The US has long criticised Pakistan for failing to aggressively go after the Haqqanis. In recent remarks on his recent Afghanistan and South Asia policy, Trump claimed that billions were paid to Pakistan \"at the same time they are housing the very terrorists that we are fighting. But that will have to change, and that will change immediately.\"At a rally in Pennsylvania on Wednesday, Trump claimed: \"America is being respected again.\" \"Something happened today where a country that totally disrespected us called with some very, very important news. And one of my generals came in, they said, you know, I have to tell you, a year ago they would have never done that. It was a great sign of respect. You'll probably be hearing about it over the next few days.\"\"Today they are free,\" Trump said of the hostages recovered from the terrorist group, crediting the US-Pakistani partnership for securing the release. US officials call the Haqqani network, the group believed to be behind the kidnapping, a terrorist organisation and have targeted its leaders with drone strikes. But the group also operates like a criminal network. Unlike the militant Islamic State group, it does not typically execute Western hostages, preferring to ransom them for cash. The Haqqani network had previously demanded the release of Anas Haqqani, a son of the founder of the group, in exchange for turning over the American-Canadian family. In one of the videos released by their captors, Boyle implored the Afghan government not to execute Taliban prisoners or he and his wife would be killed Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said her country was \"greatly relieved\" the family was safe, and she thanked the US, Afghan and Pakistani governments for their efforts. US officials claim that several other Americans are being held by militant groups in Afghanistan or Pakistan. They include Kevin King, 60, a teacher at the American University of Afghanistan in Kabul who was abducted in August 2016, and Paul Overby, an author in his 70s who had travelled to the region several times but disappeared in eastern Afghanistan in mid-2014. \n", "title": "Everything you need to know about the kidnapping and recovery of Caitlan Coleman and Joshua Boyle", "author": "AFP | AP | Zulfiqar Ali"}, "1364227": {"date": "Updated October 17, 2017", "article": "\n\nLAMONGAN (Indonesia): Indonesian goalkeeper Choirul Huda of the Persela Lamongan walks out for the match against Semen Padang on Sunday.\u2014Reuters\n\n\nJAKARTA: Indonesian football fans are mourning the death of Choirul Huda, the long-term goalkeeper and captain of top flight side Lamongan FC, usually known as Persela, following an accidental collision with a team-mate during a weekend match at their stadium in East Java. Huda slumped to the ground after slamming into Brazilian midfielder Ramon Rodrigues de Mesquita during Sunday\u2019s game in the Go-Jek Traveloka league against Semen Padang at Surajaya Stadium. Rodrigues\u2019 knee had accidentally collided with Huda\u2019s chest in the incident, said the club\u2019s media officer Andika Hangga Pramana. Video footage showed the 38-year-old clutching his chest in pain before he was taken off the pitch on a stretcher after losing consciousness and a medical team at the stadium attempted to resuscitate him. He was rushed to a nearby hospital, but died several hours later. In a statement released by the club, doctor Yudistira Andri Nugroho, head of the emergency Care Unit at the Soegiri Hospital, Lamongan, said Huda, the team captain and a veteran of more than 500 games since his debut in 1999, sustained a traumatic injury and died of cardiac arrest. Nugroho said Huda suffered possible neck and head trauma from the impact to his chest and lower jaw after he dived at the feet of on-rushing players and was caught by the legs of Rodrigues. \u201cHuda was taken to the hospital\u2019s intensive care unit and given breathing assistance and cardiopulmonary resuscitation, but his condition deteriorated and he was pronounced dead at 4.45 pm,\u201d Nugroho said a statement. \u201cWe did all we could to restore the vital functions of Choirul Huda\u2019s organs,\u201d the doctor said. His fellow players had gone to straight to the hospital after the final whistle following their 2-0 win and supporters later went to his house with candles. Edy Rahmayadi, the chairman of Indonesia\u2019s football association, issued a statement Monday saying: \u201cIndonesian football grieves and loses with the death of Choirul Huda, one of Indonesia\u2019s best goalkeepers. May your soul rest in peace.\u201d It was the fourth death in the Indonesian league since 2000, most caused by collisions between players.Persela paid tribute to Huda calling him \u201cThe Real Legend\u201d of the club in a posting on Twitter. According to the team\u2019s Instagram page, the club will retire the number one jersey worn by Huda. Thousands of fans also took to social media in memory of Huda, who had been known to Persela supporters as \u201cOne Man, One Club, One Love\u201d. Huda leaves behind a wife and two children.

These projections are even lower than Pakistan\u2019s $18bn estimates for the current year\u2019s foreign exchange needs.Meanwhile, the finance ministry was, behind the scene, in negotiation with local and international banks for short-term inflows to sustain national forex reserves of about $14bn \u2014 a threshold for three months of import cover \u2014 to remain an uninterrupted recipient of the World Bank loan.During this breathing space, Pakistan has to fill the gap for a longer sustainability through a combination of relatively cheaper sukuk (Islamic bonds) backed by assets collateral and traditional international commercial bond, totalling around $2bn with five- to 10-year maturity.The process is almost ready: banks selected, markets identified and targets firmed up, but the decision on the precise timing is as yet undecided.Though it is easier said than done, in an environment of heightened political and institutional temperature \u2014 to which Mr Dar and his political leadership had a fair share of contribution \u2014 the country still needs to calm the critical commentary that is creating a perception of crisis on the economic, security and political fronts.This is important because mark-up costs from international capital markets are directly linked to the vulnerability and eagerness factor of the fund-raising client.More importantly, doing so would be a test of PML-N\u2019s political maturity and negotiation skills to manage expectations of additional domestic resource flows to voters in an election year, and the security needs that have been constrained by disruption of about Rs125bn on account of Coalition Support Fund from the United States this year.Mr Dar has sent the message across that the security cost has increased from 17pc of federal budget four years ago to 21pc even though many allocations remain wrapped in other grants and Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).In this push and pull for a greater share in a limited pie, the powerful have always been able to secure the most, but a fine balance would depend on many variables.Under a tighter control on the purse this year, the Ministry of Finance has thrown the lowest first quarter fiscal deficit in 10 years \u2014 0.9pc of GDP \u2014 despite a higher-than-usual development expenditure and lower non-tax revenue yield.This is a significant sign as the country showed the highest full-year fiscal deficit in five years just last year and private economists forecasted a deficit of 1.5pc of GDP in the first quarter this year.On its part, the government has already passed on the additional security cost of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor to the public at large by making its financing a part of the consumer tariff in case of all the power projects on the one hand, and the cost of other development PSDP projects on the other.On top of that, Mr Dar has been advocating setting aside at least 3pc of net divisible pool resources for additional security expenditure.Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi has taken steps to pacify the environment. He has supervised healthy briefings to key stakeholders for a \u201cbetter understanding\u201d and sent outreach teams of revenue machinery to explain why filing income tax returns by every individual is a key to expanding the tax base.At the same time, he has directed the finance minister to create space out of the divisible pool under the National Finance Commission (NFC) to proportionately bear the burden of additional security costs \u2014 a proposal Mr Dar has been advancing for almost two years now without any result, except delaying the fresh NFC arrangement.Stakeholders need to rise above the impression of pointing figures and jointly put the house in order, both in economic and security deliverables, instead of scratching wounds that would help none.

Some might recall that details from the LTP in question were published by Dawn in a long detailed report in May, and the same minister had reacted sharply at the time, saying that the details are \u201cfactually incorrect\u201d and the real plan will be made public once it has been finalised. It looks like that moment is at last arriving, if the minister lives up to his promise of releasing the full document. If they do what they did earlier in the year, and produce a shortened, sanitised and general summary of the main LTP, and release that claiming that it is the original document, we will know that an effort is being made to conceal the real details of CPEC from the public. To recap the conversations that took place around the time when the Dawn story revealed the details of the plan, there were four main areas of focus identified by the Chinese side and a few from the Pakistanis. The Chinese appeared primarily interested in agriculture, industrial zones and tourism, along with a digital strategy to expand fibre optic connectivity and build a submarine cable landing station in Gwadar to carry some of their digital traffic from the western provinces out via Pakistan rather than routing it through servers in Europe.\nCPEC is about preparing the country to receive massive amounts of Chinese investments, personnel and culture.\nIn addition, there was a detailed financial strategy, which called upon the government of Pakistan to expand the role of the yuan in its economy, turn more to raising debt from the markets in Hong Kong, and dedicate increasing resources from its own budget, as well as provincial and local bodies\u2019 budgets, towards CPEC-related priorities.Since then, we have seen something odd happening. Many of the priorities identified in the LTP have indeed been pursued since, but without any of the fanfare associated with the inauguration of roads and power plants. For example, the national food security policy announced in July contained an entire section dedicated to the creation of CPEC-related agriculture development zones as one solution to the country\u2019s future food security issues. Many of the details in that policy document sound almost identical to the priorities highlighted by the Chinese in their LTP document, produced by the China Development Bank under the auspices of the National Development Reform Commission.In other examples, a recent news item highlighted the fact that a Chinese company has entered into an MoU with the city of Karachi to build an elevated road, almost four kilometres long, from Clifton Beach to Hawkesbay. A closer read of the actual MoU shows that the road is in fact being built to carry traffic to a Chinese resort to be built in Hawkesbay beach, possibly one of the first of the many tourist resorts to be built along the coastal strip from Badin to Gwadar identified in the Dawn report.There are innumerable examples now. Land acquisition is under way in various areas around KP to build housing for Chinese personnel who will reside in the province in the years when CPEC-related investment begins pouring into the country. The basic point here is simple: we have all been led to believe that CPEC is about connectivity, roads and power plants. In reality, it is about much more than that. It is about preparing the country to receive massive amounts of Chinese investments, personnel and culture. None of this implies that CPEC is a bad thing, as some people are ready to conclude without reflection. It is only to imply that the real details of what is being negotiated under the CPEC umbrella need to be publicly known, and efforts to hide these details from the public in a democratic country like Pakistan, where transparency and debate around issues of national importance are the norm, are bound to fuel adverse commentary and conspiracy theorising.When the minister issued his sharp response to the Dawn story about the LTP, he was given a clear stage upon which to air his grievances with the story. When has asked for more time to be allowed to make the details of the LTP, he was given the time he said he required. But now that he has confirmed that the LTP is about to be finalised, it must be insisted that the time to deliver on his commitment has also arrived.It is worth bearing in mind a couple of tricks that the government could resort to in order to try and wiggle out of this commitment without appearing to do so. Early in the year, when it needed provincial government assent for the plan, it generated a shorter, edited draft of the original LTP and circulated that to the provincial governments. Later, the government tried to argue that the edited version is the real one, and the longer, detailed draft was only a \u201cworking document\u201d. A few people fell for this gimmick, thinking that somehow there are multiple drafts of the plan in play. In reality there was only one, and the shorter one was only a summary meant for public consumption with all vital details removed. Such gimmickry must not be resorted to this time. The LTP is one of the most important documents in the arena these days, far more than the LNG contract that members of the opposition parties are clamouring for access to. It is bewildering to see the same members of the opposition parties holding their silence regarding the disclosure of the LTP. How has the silence of the opposition parties been obtained? Have they seen the LTP to be satisfied that no further discussion is required? The demands for CPEC transparency are more consequential for Pakistan\u2019s long-term prospects, especially for its economy, and silence does not serve that interest well.

Almost all pollution-related deaths \u2014 around 92 per cent \u2014 took place in poor or middle-income countries, the research found. And in rapidly industrialising countries such as India, Pakistan, China, Bangladesh, Madagascar, pollution is linked to as many as a quarter of all fatalities. \u201cPollution is much more than an environmental challenge; it is a profound and pervasive threat that affects many aspects of human health and wellbeing,\u201d said Philip Landrigan, a professor at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in the United States who co-led the study.  The study found pollution was linked to around nine million deaths in 2015.  Dirty air \u2014 caused by everything from transport and industry to indoor fires \u2014 was the biggest contributor linked to 6.5m deaths, it said.  The next biggest contributor was polluted water that spread gastrointestinal diseases and parasitic infections and killed 1.8m people.  The greatest numbers of deaths linked to pollution in that year were in India with 2.5m, and China with 1.8m.  The research, conducted by about 40 international scientists, used data from the Global Burden of Disease study from the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington. It was published in The Lancet medical journal on Friday.Here are the countries with the highest number of pollution-related deaths and as percentage of all deaths. India, 2,515,518 deaths (24.5pc); China, 1,838,251 (19.5pc); Pakistan, 311,189 (21.9pc); Bangladesh, 260,836 (26.6pc); Nigeria, 257,093 (18.7pc); Indonesia, 211,896 (13.5pc); Russia, 172,536 (8.6pc); US, 155,155 (5.7pc); Ethiopia, 129,450 (19.1pc); and Democratic Republic of the Congo, 123,942 (18pc).Published in Dawn, October 21st, 2017\n", "title": "Study links pollution to millions of deaths worldwide", "author": "Agencies"}, "1281566": {"date": "Updated September 02, 2016", "article": "MONTEVIDEO: Lionel Messi scored the winning goal on his return from a short-lived international retirement on Thursday as Argentina defeated Uruguay to take control of South America's 2018 World Cup qualifying race.Messi had stunned the footballing world in June after vowing to never play for Argentina again following an agonizing defeat to Chile in the final of the Copa America Centenario.But that tearful farewell was a distant memory at Mendoza's Estadio Malvinas on Thursday as the Barcelona superstar orchestrated a 1-0 victory over the two-time World Cup winners.Messi, showing no sign of the groin injury which had placed a question mark against his participation, lashed home the winner on 42 minutes, with his low shot taking a wicked deflection to deceive Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera at the near post.Afterwards Messi paid tribute to the rapturous applause he received throughout.In the dying minutes one young fan sprinted onto the pitch and nearly flattened the five-time world footballer of the year with a congratulatory hug.\u201cI am grateful to the people for the treatment, for the love,\u201d Messi said, insisting his retirement announcement in June was genuine as he digested a third defeat in a final with Argentina in as many years.\u201cI wasn't trying to cheat anyone, I said what I felt. [Now] I feel happy,\u201d Messi said.Argentina's new coach Edgardo Bauza meanwhile saluted Messi's commitment in returning to play despite his niggling groin problem.The coach hinted Messi may be rested for Argentina's next match, against Venezuela on Tuesday. \u201cIf he's not right we won't risk him,\u201d Bauza said.\u201cI know how painful it is to suffer a groin injury \u2013 but Messi's character meant he was always going to stay on the pitch tonight.\u201d Argentina's win came after a superb backs-to-the-wall defensive effort in the second half when they had been reduced to 10 men following the dismissal of young Juventus striker Paulo Dybala just before half-time.Dybala, 22, was escorted from the pitch in tears after the red card.Jesus the saviour for Brazil\nArgentina's win leaves them in first place in South America's marathon round-robin qualifying campaign with 14 points from seven games.Elsewhere Thursday, there was an impressive win for Brazil over Ecuador in the thin air of Quito, which is situated a dizzying 2,850 meters (9,350 feet) above sea level.Brazil had never won a qualifying game in the Ecuadoran capital before, but two goals from teenage prodigy Gabriel Jesus and a penalty from Neymar handed the five-time world champions a 3-0 victory.Jesus, the 19-year-old who signed for English side Manchester City from Palmeiras in August, was outstanding, underscoring his status as the brightest talent in Brazilian football.Jesus won the penalty for the first goal after bursting into the area and drawing a foul from Ecuador goalkeeper Alexander Dominguez.Neymar duly converted before Jesus doubled Brazil's lead three minutes from time with a sublime flicked finish from Marcelo's low cross to make it 2-0.Jesus, who like Neymar had played in Brazil's gold medal-winning Olympic football campaign, then added a third in stoppage time with a crisp finish into the top corner.The win left Brazil in fifth place overall in the standings with 12 points from seven games.In other matches on Thursday, Colombia defeated Venezuela 2-0 in their port city stronghold of Barranquilla.Goals from Real Madrid star James Rodriguez and Macnelly Torres secured the points for Colombia, who would have won by more had it not been for two missed penalties in the final 10 minutes.The win leaves Colombia level with Ecuador and Uruguay on 13 points, just behind leaders Argentina.Paraguay meanwhile are level on 12 points with Brazil after scoring a stormy 2-1 win over South American champions Chile in Asuncion.Oscar Romero and Paulo da Silva fired Paraguay 2-0 up after only nine minutes before Arturo Vidal pulled a goal back just before half-time.A fractious second half ended with Chile defender Gary Medel being sent off in the closing stages as Paraguay held on.In the day's other game, Bolivia defeated Peru 2-0 in La Paz.\n", "title": "Messi makes scoring return, Brazil sink Ecuador", "author": "AFP"}}
