Instructional content, previously restricted to the classroom, is now being broadcast at lightning speeds to anywhere from bustling metropolises to rural suburbs. Information that was inaccessible is suddenly present, organised and ready for consumption by anyone who is yearning to learn.In our neck of the woods, where public universities are rife with enormous student teacher ratios and private education comes at the expense of debt-inducing tuition, the online learning phenomenon can prove to be a game changer.In fact, Pakistan was among the pioneering nations to develop and successfully implement distant learning in the form of Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU). Courses were offered and degrees conferred in several disciplines in humanities and sciences to those who couldn\u2019t access higher education due to distance, financial woes or simply luck. Along the way, however, we lost our grand vision of \u2018education for all\u2019 \u2014 mostly due to our own inability to recognise the magnitude of the breakthrough we had made. AIOU took a backseat and a half-hearted Virtual University emerged.Online learning could help us regain that lost footing as well as bridge the gap between public and private education.Offered free or at a fraction of the cost online learning is a multifaceted and impactful medium of instruction that takes educational content developed at universities or by specialist educators and houses it on the internet for popular consumption by the masses.\nEducation via the internet can be a game changer.\n\nUnlike conventional learning settings with time constraints, limited student-teacher interaction etc, virtual learning provides education tailored to meet the specific needs of each student. Passive exercises of listening to lectures and jotting notes are replaced with audio or video instruction, which enables students to stop, pause or rewind often until mastery over a topic of interest has been achieved. While some students might pursue advanced topics that further their understanding of a discipline, others might chose to take foundational courses. The freedom to choose, therefore, rejects the \u2018one size fits all\u2019 model of education and presents a more coherent, customizable form of curriculum. This manner of end-to-end control over learning was previously absent in one-dimensional classroom environments.Analysing the core ingredients of these unique courses reveals that, once constraints of conventional classrooms are removed, several lucrative opportunities emerge. The hour-long monolithic lecture, for instance, can be broken down into modular eight- to 12-minute units, each representing a coherent concept. Accounting for an average human attention span of 15-minutes, these digestible chunks allow students to traverse the materials in several different ways depending on their background, skills or interests; thus allowing for better absorption of knowledge. Interestingly, one unexpected benefit of online learning manifests in the form of data. Intelligence gathered from online interactions gives unprecedented insights into a student\u2019s learning patterns/interactive behaviour. Imagine the possibilities: human learning can be transitioned from hypothesis-based mode to data-driven mode to understand fundamental questions like what learning strategies are effective versus ones that are not. Similarly, in the context of specific courses, common misconceptions can be identified and solutions developed.Advocates of conventional learning often highlight the multisensory appeal of the traditional method. The ability to participate in group projects, experience on-campus, and most of all, develop lifelong friendships are all plausible arguments in context of attending a formal institution of study. The glaring reality, however, stands in stark contrast to those parallels. According to Unesco, 25 million children in Pakistan \u2014 63pc are girls \u2014 are not enrolled at any institution of study. This ranks our country second behind Nigeria in the line of nations where the youth are not afforded the opportunity to academically train and develop suitable skillsets.The majority of that number represents youth who face social, cultural or financial barriers, restricting their access to mainstream academics. Providing cheap smart devices that connect to internally developed opencoursewares could be one such solution that solves the accessibility problem to a large extent.Virtual access not only leads to unparalleled proliferation of knowledge, but also creates a curriculum singularity that offers the same educational quality to every student regardless of age, location or financial situation. Political rhetoric about implementing the same curriculum throughout the nation could become a tangible reality if the online learning framework is properly road-mapped and strategically implemented.

Petitioner Bashir Ahmed, a resident of Larkana, moved the SHC over alleged embezzlement of funds allocated for the uplift works in Larkana and impleaded PPP women wing chief MNA Faryal Talpur, who is a sister of PPP co-chairman Asif Ali Zardari, former town Nazim Dr Shafqat Hussain Soomro, former law minister Ayaz Soomro, the then district coordination officer, deputy commissioner, project director of the Larkana development project and others as respondents in the petition. Besides other development schemes, he contended that after the 2008 elections, Rs12 billions funds had been allocated for the development and beautification of Larkana city and alleged that roads and other development works were made without any proper planning while substandard material was used because of alleged corruption by the respondents. \nPetition filed in January 2013 at Larkana bench transferred to Karachi\n\nThe petitioner pointed out that mostly the reconstructed roads were destroyed in rains while several others had developed cracks at different places. Besides none of the roads of Larkana city had been improved or widened, he added. He further maintained that people of Larkana were facing hardships in shape of traffic jams, dust-polluted air, stagnant \nsewage water on roads and frequent accidents. He argued that internal drains and roads had been made with substandard material and major portion of the grant had been usurped, but nobody had taken the pain to check the condition of the city. He asked the court to order the constitution of a committee based on honest town planners and other technical persons to probe into the misappropriation, ill-planning and embezzlement of public money of Larkana development project on large scale by the respondents in the name of former prime minister Benazir Bhutto. A two-judge bench of the SHC headed by Chief Justice Sajjad Ali Shah observed that the petitioner\u2019s grievance appeared to be that money had been misappropriated in the Annual Development Project in Larkana. According to the petitioner a total of Rs90 billion was granted in the schemes of the ADP, but hardly a few billion was spent, the court order said. Denying the allegations of corruption, an additional attorney-general contended that they were totally exaggerated. However, the bench directed the law officer to submit a statement reflecting the ADP funds allocated for Larkana from 2008 up to the date. The hearing was adjourned for a date to be later notified by the office. It may be recalled that the petition was filed in January 2013 at the Circuit bench Larkana, but the matter could only be taken up for one time at Larkana.

A graduate of the prestigious National College of the Arts, his mission is to promote a positive and often unseen side of Pakistan through his photographs. In 2014, he published a book of photographs of Pakistani icons, \u2018Dharkan: the Heartbeat of a Nation\u2019. He has since given two TED talks and has exhibited his works in the United States, Italy, China, Pakistan, India and Iraq.His first documentary film, \u2018Hellhole\u2019, has also been selected for screening at the New Orleans Film Festival 2016. \u2018Hellhole\u2019 is the story of a worker in Karachi who cleans gutters.

He has travelled all over Pakistan and met the people, filmed the places and we thought it was important to create a show that displayed the most far-flung areas of the country.\u201dShe added: \u201cI taught Mobeen in school in the sixth grade, so it has been an interesting journey with him.

Mr Ansari said: \u201cI became interested in photography during my O Levels and it actually helped that I lost my hearing at a very young age because it allowed me to be very visual and appreciate the most beautiful aspects of the mundane. It also inspired me to travel.\u201d\n\n\n\nExplaining his work, he added: \u201cMost of the portraits you see here have been taken in the last five years, off the beaten path, or places where they do not speak the same language as us. But art transcends all barriers and in this case it helped me to transcend the language barrier. I did not need to say anything and I took most of the pictures with my hearing aid off.\u201dSome of the portraits were taken in Broghil, a small place in the Wah Khan Corridor between Afghanistan and Pakistan. The second documentary screened at the event was also filed in the Wah Khan Corridor against the backdrop of the national anthem.The photographs are dramatic portraits of ordinary Pakistani people, and each picture is evocative, insightful and unique. Mr Ansari\u2019s talent for capturing the story and essence of his subject in one click is masterful.

These included commercial and residential units in DHA Phase I and II in Islamabad and in some private housing societies including the River Edge Housing Authority which is owned by PTI leader Aleem Khan and Eden Garden Housing Society which is owned by a relative of former chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry.\nBad investments will mean shortage of money for beneficiaries, EOBI chief tells PAC\n\nAccording to Mr Faruqui, the EOBI board of trustees had declared the decision to invest in the stated properties illegal and void ab initio, which means \u201cto be treated as invalid from the outset\u201d.Established on April 1, 1976 the objective of the EOBI was to ensure those who are insured with them or their heirs are given pensions or social insurance in case of death or disability.It invested billions of rupees in suspect deals without mandatory approval of its board of trustees.In 2013, the Supreme Court had taken suo motu notice of the purchases made during 2012-13 while the purchases made in 2005 were not taken up.The properties were purchased at higher than the market price, which cost the institutions billions of rupees.\u201cThe market value of these properties is still less than that for which the EOBI management purchased it,\u201d Mr Faruqui said, adding that there has only been a slight increase in the EOBI land in DHA Phase I and two properties in Lahore.Mr Faruqui said the institution had invested in these properties in order to generate revenue and that the majority of plots in the housing societies were yet to be developed. \u201cThe previous management paid a full price for undeveloped plots which was in violation of the rules and was against the interests of EOBI,\u201d he said.Chief executive of the Pakistan Real Estate Investment and Management Company (Primaco) which is a subsidiary of the EOBI, retired Brigadier Amjad Ali said the 400 plots that the EOBI had purchased on October 3, 2005 were in hard-to-reach waste land and that the land was a joint venture of the DHA, Bahria Town and Habib Rafiq (Private) \nLimited.According to Mr Ali, the price of land in the said area has slightly increased after a bridge was constructed and the land was connected to the main road six months ago.The PAC was told that the EOBI had terminated the services of over 300 employees who had been inducted in violation of the rules during the previous government and the EOBI chairman said the sacked employees had not returned their official vehicles. He added that the cars had been purchased for Rs480 million and that efforts were being made to retrieve themHe said that the former EOBI chairman, Zafar Gondal is in jail in connection with an EOBI corruption case while his co-accused has obtained bail.

{"1281121": {"date": "Updated August 31, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe writer is an attorney teaching constitutional law and political philosophy.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nRishiraj Singh is the excise commissioner in the Indian state of Kerala. In the most recent photograph of him that I could find, he sports the khaki uniform of his position and a formidable moustache. In the last half of August, however, Rishiraj Singh has become known for something else, an edict against men who stare at women. While addressing a small group of people in the city of Kochi on women\u2019s safety, Singh declared that any man found staring at a woman for more than 14 seconds could be put in jail. Since India is a country of men who like to stare, his statement provoked immediate attention and ire; the Indian newspaper India Express labelled the statement \u2018absurd\u2019 and included an interview with a lawyer who said that there was no such law. Others largely took the same tone: how dare Indian men be threatened with imprisonment for staring at Indian women. In the words of one Indian attorney: \u201cThere is no such provision in any law of this country and there cannot be such a mindless provision of law in any other country of the world. Period.\u201d The message to women, Indian and otherwise: it\u2019s a man\u2019s world and staring at women must necessarily be a part of it. \nMen stare and stare and stare \u2014 old men and young men; bearded men and clean-shaven men; the supposedly religious and the avowedly secular. Staring at women is indeed the glue that binds.\n\nPakistan is also a country of staring men. Any Pakistani woman, young or old, rich or poor, has her staring stories \u2014 tales of men who stare at women in buses, at school, restaurants, banks, work and in parks. All of them will tell you that there is no corner of Pakistan that is not populated by men who stare. Learning to put up with staring is possibly the first line in the book of male dominance that is the contemporary Pakistani story. Men stare and stare and stare \u2014 old men and young men; bearded men and clean-shaven men; the supposedly religious and the avowedly secular. Staring at women is indeed the glue that binds the male species of the subcontinent together. They may disagree on politics, be at each other\u2019s throats over religion, stab and shoot at the provocations of sectarianism or the particulars of ethnicity, but they all believe in staring, everywhere and always. All of these reasons make the statement by the excise commissioner interesting and almost revolutionary. The male of the South Asian species does not generally like to admit his proclivities for visual excess and optic dominance, let alone abridge them. If and when men are confronted about staring, they deny they have partaken of such activity.Indeed, perhaps because it is so prevalent, engaged in with such zest and regularity, it is possible that the men who do it, like addicts of other kinds, believe their own lies. I never stare, have never stared, will never stare, all rolling off their tongues with the ease granted by practice. And all the while staring continues unabated and everywhere.In the odd and unlikely case that staring is even admitted to, the perpetrator moves from denial to the shifting of blame, staring pinned on the wayward women, who by their very existence, their insistence on going to work or school or riding a bus or travelling in a car, or paying a bill or buying vegetables, conspire to wheedle men into staring. It is an old trick and all men, young and old, can perform it with the prowess of Olympic athletes. Interestingly, males of the human species are not alone in the act of staring. Experts point out that prolonged staring among other living creatures signals a challenge and an act of domination. If one among this variety stares at an opponent for more than 14 seconds, it would be because he wants to make a clear statement about who is boss: the starer and not the stared at.Beyond animal science, feminist social theorists and philosophers have long pointed out how the \u2018male gaze\u2019 serves to intimidate and discipline women. It\u2019s not a revolutionary thesis; its implications in the Pakistani context and in many other parts of the Muslim world have meant a very literal disciplining, shoving women out of the public sphere into the private one, its crude and pathetic logic insisting that if there are no women to stare at, men will not stare.For all of these reasons, it is not absurd but quite groundbreaking to suggest a law that would punish men for staring at women for longer than 14 seconds. If the men who indulge in it want to understand just how insulting, intrusive and lecherous it is to maintain a largely unwanted eye contact for this period, I suggest they all request another man to stare at them for just that period. Many revelations are in store for them if and when they do, chief among them how insulting, intrusive and repulsive staring is for the subject of the constant gaze. At the end, they can spare a moment to consider the exponential rate at which these repugnant consequences are multiplied when the arrangement is not an experiment, and the one staring not a friend or colleague.  One is not sure how many men would want to partake of the experiment. After all, who wants to experience something disgusting; the wealthy never wish to pretend to be poor, the powerful never play at being powerless and so why should those who are smug about their staring habits, ever attempt to understand just how coercive and unpleasant this action is for the other half of the population. Among men of this sort, the commissioner from Kerala is a venerable and hopeful exception, one man who realises that for staring to stop, it must be fined and punished, exposed as perverse and disgusting; it might be okay in the animal kingdom but certainly not for the human species.

This was one of the major policy decisions taken at an apex committee meeting, which was jointly chaired by Sindh Governor Ishratul Ibad and Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, held at CM House on Wednesday.The apex committee decided that both the operation and investigation wings of police would be strengthened with the recruitment of personnel for a riot force and an IT wing besides establishment of facilitation centres.Corps Commander Lt Gen Naveed Mukhtar, senior minister Nisar Ahmad Khuhro, DG Rangers Maj Gen Bilal Akbar, IG Sindh A.D. Khwaja, Additional IGs Mushtaq Mahar and Sanaullah Abbasi, advocate general Zamir Ghummro, prosecutor general Shahadat Awan and other officials concerned attended the meeting. Sources privy to the meeting quoted the chief minister as saying that no one would be allowed to forcibly impose his will on the people and collect extortion money in the cover of welfare work. Maj Gen Bilal Akbar highlighted the need to do away with the quota system and to ensure recruitment on merit in Sindh to remove a sense of deprivation among the people and help in keeping them away from crime. \nSindh to approach Centre for repatriation of illegal immigrants; registration of tenants to continue under NAP\n\n According to the police spokesman, the IG earlier briefed the apex committee about the need to develop automation system in the police department. He said the Punjab government had agreed to provide their software to the Sindh police free of cost. He said an IT cadre could be created under a deputy inspector general for IT with 2,500 well-trained officials to operate criminal record, human resource and complaint management systems.The chief minister approved the proposal and directed the chief secretary to get the formalities completed at the earliest. He also approved the formation of a riot force. Besides, the apex committee decided that new number plates, which would have complete security features, including a tracking system, would be introduced for vehicles. In this regard, the chief secretary was asked to coordinate with the excise department. It was decided that welfare organisations interested in collecting hides on Eid would have to seek a no-objection certificate from the deputy commissioners concerned so that the government could audit their accounts. The committee also called for effective enforcement of a ban on the display of arms. Police investigationThe apex body also decided to strengthen investigation wing of the Sindh police. The chief minister asked the police chief to send him a proposal for recruitment of qualified detectives. The committee was earlier informed that the police had planned to recruit assistant directors/ deputy directors in BPS-17 having relevant qualification to investigate important cases of murder and kidnapping for ransom. Keeping in view investigation problems, the chief minister said he had enhanced the budget for investigation to Rs364 million in the financial year 2016-17. The IG informed the committee that Rs20,000 used to be allocated for the investigation of each murder and kidnapping for ransom case, and Rs11,000 for bank robbery investigation. The government increased it to Rs100,000 for the investigation of each case of murder, gang rape, kidnapping for ransom and bank robbery, he said. The investigation budget for each case of bomb explosion, suicide attack, targeted killing and anti-state activities had been increased to Rs500,000. The chief minister also directed the IGP to talk to the Punjab police for the establishment of a forensic lab in Karachi. \u2018I have already approved Rs2 billion for the purpose but I want you to expedite it,\u201d he said. Mr Shah noted that the recruitment of 200 inspectors for investigation and 170 law inspectors were taking time. \u201cI would urge you [law minister, AG and IGP] to explore ways and means so that all the recruitments in police could be made urgently but purely on merit. The IGP told the meeting that he had started recruitment of 14,000 constables through NTS and involved army officers for physical checking. The chief minister also approved the establishment of facilitation centres to address day-to-day issues of common man and to bridge a gap between police and public. RepatriationIt was decided that the federal government would be approached to ensure the repatriation of illegal immigrants, particularly the Afghans. The apex committee was informed that the names of 602 persons had been put on the Fourth Schedule, indicating they could be a threat to peaceful atmosphere and for the purpose 41 cases had been registered. The meeting was also briefed on the progress of cases recommended for military courts, hate speeches, and violation of loud speakers etc.Referring to the implementation of NAP and China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), the chief minister asked the Rangers and police to take concrete steps so that the decisions taken for the NAP and CPEC could be implemented in letter and spirit. The apex committee was informed that 806 ex-army personnel had been recruited and 168 of them had been deployed for the security of Chinese engineers on a two-year contract. It was told that 638 more soldiers would join training next week.The apex committee was also briefed on the August 22 violence, its investigation and arrests.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Habib Khan Ghori", "title": "Apex body decides to take targeted operation to its logical end"}}

Instructional content, previously restricted to the classroom, is now being broadcast at lightning speeds to anywhere from bustling metropolises to rural suburbs. Information that was inaccessible is suddenly present, organised and ready for consumption by anyone who is yearning to learn.In our neck of the woods, where public universities are rife with enormous student teacher ratios and private education comes at the expense of debt-inducing tuition, the online learning phenomenon can prove to be a game changer.In fact, Pakistan was among the pioneering nations to develop and successfully implement distant learning in the form of Allama Iqbal Open University (AIOU). Courses were offered and degrees conferred in several disciplines in humanities and sciences to those who couldn\u2019t access higher education due to distance, financial woes or simply luck. Along the way, however, we lost our grand vision of \u2018education for all\u2019 \u2014 mostly due to our own inability to recognise the magnitude of the breakthrough we had made. AIOU took a backseat and a half-hearted Virtual University emerged.Online learning could help us regain that lost footing as well as bridge the gap between public and private education.Offered free or at a fraction of the cost online learning is a multifaceted and impactful medium of instruction that takes educational content developed at universities or by specialist educators and houses it on the internet for popular consumption by the masses.\nEducation via the internet can be a game changer.\n\nUnlike conventional learning settings with time constraints, limited student-teacher interaction etc, virtual learning provides education tailored to meet the specific needs of each student. Passive exercises of listening to lectures and jotting notes are replaced with audio or video instruction, which enables students to stop, pause or rewind often until mastery over a topic of interest has been achieved. While some students might pursue advanced topics that further their understanding of a discipline, others might chose to take foundational courses. The freedom to choose, therefore, rejects the \u2018one size fits all\u2019 model of education and presents a more coherent, customizable form of curriculum. This manner of end-to-end control over learning was previously absent in one-dimensional classroom environments.Analysing the core ingredients of these unique courses reveals that, once constraints of conventional classrooms are removed, several lucrative opportunities emerge. The hour-long monolithic lecture, for instance, can be broken down into modular eight- to 12-minute units, each representing a coherent concept. Accounting for an average human attention span of 15-minutes, these digestible chunks allow students to traverse the materials in several different ways depending on their background, skills or interests; thus allowing for better absorption of knowledge. Interestingly, one unexpected benefit of online learning manifests in the form of data. Intelligence gathered from online interactions gives unprecedented insights into a student\u2019s learning patterns/interactive behaviour. Imagine the possibilities: human learning can be transitioned from hypothesis-based mode to data-driven mode to understand fundamental questions like what learning strategies are effective versus ones that are not. Similarly, in the context of specific courses, common misconceptions can be identified and solutions developed.Advocates of conventional learning often highlight the multisensory appeal of the traditional method. The ability to participate in group projects, experience on-campus, and most of all, develop lifelong friendships are all plausible arguments in context of attending a formal institution of study. The glaring reality, however, stands in stark contrast to those parallels. According to Unesco, 25 million children in Pakistan \u2014 63pc are girls \u2014 are not enrolled at any institution of study. This ranks our country second behind Nigeria in the line of nations where the youth are not afforded the opportunity to academically train and develop suitable skillsets.The majority of that number represents youth who face social, cultural or financial barriers, restricting their access to mainstream academics. Providing cheap smart devices that connect to internally developed opencoursewares could be one such solution that solves the accessibility problem to a large extent.Virtual access not only leads to unparalleled proliferation of knowledge, but also creates a curriculum singularity that offers the same educational quality to every student regardless of age, location or financial situation. Political rhetoric about implementing the same curriculum throughout the nation could become a tangible reality if the online learning framework is properly road-mapped and strategically implemented.

Speaker Rana Muhammad Iqbal lost his temper and uttered \u201cshut up\u201d before getting Mian Aslam\u2019s mike closed that provoked sharp response from the MPA as well as opposition members.

The speaker expunged Aslam Iqbal\u2019s remarks.\nHouse passes PRA, animal slaughter amendment bills\n\nOpposition Leader Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and other members also joined Aslam Iqbal in reprimanding the speaker for his attitude towards opposition benches. Treasury members also stood up and entered into a war of words with the opposition besides chanting slogans against PTI.The opposition leader remarked that the speaker most of the time remained partial and passed comments unworthy of him. Eventually, all opposition members walked out of the house.The speaker sent ministers Tahir Khalil Sindhu and Chaudhry Shair Ali to bring the opposition back but to no avail. In a second attempt the speaker included law minister Rana Sanaullah in the ministers\u2019 delegation to woo the \nopposition and adjourned the session for 10 minutes. The session resumed as the opposition returned and the opposition leader again censured the speaker for using expression like \u201cshut up\u201d and \u201cbe ready to face consequences\u201d instead of running the house in a prudent manner and ensure that all members should get answers to their questions.

Akbar was the driving force as he anchored the chase with help from opener Zain and Tariq. Man-of-the-match Akbar\u2019s 38-ball knock of 65 included eight boundaries and two sixes. The unbroken partnership Akbar and Tariq was worth 67 in just 31 balls. Zain dominated the early overs of Karachi Whites innings as the left-handed opener scored 39 with his 32-ball effort laced with six fours. But the icing on the cake was provided by seasoned campaigner Tariq Haroon as the all-rounder bludgeoned 42 from only 18 deliveries as he clobbered three sixes and as many fours against a formidable Lahore Whites bowling.

Kamran, who made 91 and 81 in the previous two matches won by his side, was bowled for a first-ball by Test fast bowler Sohail Khan. Lahore Whites then lost Imran Butt (11) before Salman was joined by Umar in a splendid partnership of 121 before were out in the space of four balls. Umar fell to Sohail after striking six sixes and six fours in a breathtaking 44-ball innings of 81, while Salman was dismissed by Tariq for 73 (off 57 balls, nine fours and three sixes).

It did not identify specific victims, but said the banks varied in size and geography and used different methods for accessing SWIFT.A SWIFT spokeswoman declined to elaborate on the recently uncovered incidents or the security issues detailed in the letter, saying the firm does not discuss affairs of specific customers.All the victims shared one thing in common: Weaknesses in local security that attackers exploited to compromise local networks and send fraudulent messages requesting money transfers, according to the letter.Accounts of the attack on Bangladesh Bank suggest that weak security procedures there made it easier to hack into computers used to send SWIFT messages requesting large money transfers. The bank lacked a firewall and used second-hand, $10 electronic switches to network those computers, according to the Bangladesh police.SWIFT has repeatedly pushed banks to implement new security measures rolled out after the Bangladesh heist, including stronger systems for authenticating users and updates to its software for sending and receiving messages. But it has been difficult for SWIFT to force banks to comply because the nonprofit cooperative lacks regulatory authority over its members.SWIFT told banks Tuesday that it might report them to regulators and banking partners if they failed to meet a November 19 deadline for installing the latest version of its software, which includes new security features designed to thwart the type of attacks described in its letter.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Reuters", "title": "SWIFT discloses more cyber theft"}}

This was one of the major policy decisions taken at an apex committee meeting, which was jointly chaired by Sindh Governor Ishratul Ibad and Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, held at CM House on Wednesday.The apex committee decided that both the operation and investigation wings of police would be strengthened with the recruitment of personnel for a riot force and an IT wing besides establishment of facilitation centres.Corps Commander Lt Gen Naveed Mukhtar, senior minister Nisar Ahmad Khuhro, DG Rangers Maj Gen Bilal Akbar, IG Sindh A.D. Khwaja, Additional IGs Mushtaq Mahar and Sanaullah Abbasi, advocate general Zamir Ghummro, prosecutor general Shahadat Awan and other officials concerned attended the meeting. Sources privy to the meeting quoted the chief minister as saying that no one would be allowed to forcibly impose his will on the people and collect extortion money in the cover of welfare work. Maj Gen Bilal Akbar highlighted the need to do away with the quota system and to ensure recruitment on merit in Sindh to remove a sense of deprivation among the people and help in keeping them away from crime. \nSindh to approach Centre for repatriation of illegal immigrants; registration of tenants to continue under NAP\n\n According to the police spokesman, the IG earlier briefed the apex committee about the need to develop automation system in the police department. He said the Punjab government had agreed to provide their software to the Sindh police free of cost. He said an IT cadre could be created under a deputy inspector general for IT with 2,500 well-trained officials to operate criminal record, human resource and complaint management systems.The chief minister approved the proposal and directed the chief secretary to get the formalities completed at the earliest. He also approved the formation of a riot force. Besides, the apex committee decided that new number plates, which would have complete security features, including a tracking system, would be introduced for vehicles. In this regard, the chief secretary was asked to coordinate with the excise department. It was decided that welfare organisations interested in collecting hides on Eid would have to seek a no-objection certificate from the deputy commissioners concerned so that the government could audit their accounts. The committee also called for effective enforcement of a ban on the display of arms. Police investigationThe apex body also decided to strengthen investigation wing of the Sindh police. The chief minister asked the police chief to send him a proposal for recruitment of qualified detectives. The committee was earlier informed that the police had planned to recruit assistant directors/ deputy directors in BPS-17 having relevant qualification to investigate important cases of murder and kidnapping for ransom. Keeping in view investigation problems, the chief minister said he had enhanced the budget for investigation to Rs364 million in the financial year 2016-17. The IG informed the committee that Rs20,000 used to be allocated for the investigation of each murder and kidnapping for ransom case, and Rs11,000 for bank robbery investigation. The government increased it to Rs100,000 for the investigation of each case of murder, gang rape, kidnapping for ransom and bank robbery, he said. The investigation budget for each case of bomb explosion, suicide attack, targeted killing and anti-state activities had been increased to Rs500,000. The chief minister also directed the IGP to talk to the Punjab police for the establishment of a forensic lab in Karachi. \u2018I have already approved Rs2 billion for the purpose but I want you to expedite it,\u201d he said. Mr Shah noted that the recruitment of 200 inspectors for investigation and 170 law inspectors were taking time. \u201cI would urge you [law minister, AG and IGP] to explore ways and means so that all the recruitments in police could be made urgently but purely on merit. The IGP told the meeting that he had started recruitment of 14,000 constables through NTS and involved army officers for physical checking.

Speaker Rana Muhammad Iqbal lost his temper and uttered \u201cshut up\u201d before getting Mian Aslam\u2019s mike closed that provoked sharp response from the MPA as well as opposition members. Aslam Iqbal continued to chide the speaker while pointing finger at him for being partial, hurling threats and not giving due respect to the opposition members and their constituents. The speaker expunged Aslam Iqbal\u2019s remarks.\nHouse passes PRA, animal slaughter amendment bills\n\nOpposition Leader Mian Mahmoodur Rasheed and other members also joined Aslam Iqbal in reprimanding the speaker for his attitude towards opposition benches. Treasury members also stood up and entered into a war of words with the opposition besides chanting slogans against PTI.The opposition leader remarked that the speaker most of the time remained partial and passed comments unworthy of him. Eventually, all opposition members walked out of the house.The speaker sent ministers Tahir Khalil Sindhu and Chaudhry Shair Ali to bring the opposition back but to no avail. In a second attempt the speaker included law minister Rana Sanaullah in the ministers\u2019 delegation to woo the \nopposition and adjourned the session for 10 minutes. The session resumed as the opposition returned and the opposition leader again censured the speaker for using expression like \u201cshut up\u201d and \u201cbe ready to face consequences\u201d instead of running the house in a prudent manner and ensure that all members should get answers to their questions. Rana Sanaullah agreed with the opposition members that they must be given information up to their satisfaction. Stating that he did not want to discuss that, according to rules and regulations, the speaker\u2019s conduct could not be discussed in the house but in his chamber, Mr Sanaullah admitted the minister for housing, urban development and public health engineering should not have dispelled opposition\u2019s concerns and instead deputed somebody to look into the matter to satisfy the opposition member.Mr Sanaullah suggested that the speaker should fix time tomorrow and call opposition and treasury members to resolve Aslam Iqbal\u2019s genuine issue. The speaker, in a friendly tone, said all members were equal and thanked the opposition for returning to the house. \nHe said he did not act partially and try to handle matters according to rules and regulations. He called a meeting of opposition and treasury members at 10am on Thursday (today).The entire episode started with the \u2018casual\u2019 attitude of housing minister Tanvir Aslam Malik, who did not respond appropriately during Question Hour, when MPA Aslam Iqbal contested that his answer to the question about supply of potable water in Fazlia Colony, Ashrafia Park and Ahata Moolchand was wrong.Aslam suggested that the minister should spare some time and visit the localities in his constituency PP-148 and see whether water was being supplied or not. \u201cI will laud the Punjab government in the house, if clean drinking water was found available in the localities. Otherwise, the minister should ensure water supply for the residents,\u201d he said. The minister said he could not make commitments like this because then he would remain busy out of the house round the year. This remark infuriated Aslam Iqbal who asserted that opposition\u2019s demands aimed at public welfare should not be ridiculed. The Punjab Assembly later passed two amendment bills; The Punjab Revenue Authority (Second Amendment) Bill 2016 and The Punjab Animals Slaughter Control (Second Amendment) Bill 2016 while bulldosing opposition members\u2019 suggestions about publicising and taking public view to display collective wisdom in formulating the laws.

Otherwise, punitive action will be taken against the two important segments from Oct 15,\u201d Pemra chairman Absar Alam said at a press conference at the authority\u2019s headquarters. However, he added, action against the dealers of Indian DTH would be launched with immediate effect. The decision was taken at a meeting of the Pemra board held recently. Mr Alam said Pemra would write letters to the Federal Board of Revenue, the State Bank and agencies, including the Federal Investigation Agency, for curbing the sale of Indian DTH decoders in the country. \u201cAround three million Indian DTH decoders are being sold in the country. We not only want this sale stopped but will also ask the relevant agencies to trace the money trail to determine the mode of payments made to Indian dealers selling these decoders to Pakistanis,\u201d he said. Mr Alam said all stakeholders, including cable operators and the Pakistan Broadcasters Association, had been forewarned that steps would be initiated in near future against the airing of excessive foreign content. Under Pemra rules, only 10 per cent of airtime (two hours and 40 minutes in a 24-hour transmission) is allowed for foreign contents. The Pemra chairman directed the managements of television channels and cable operators to voluntarily follow the rules. The Pemra board meeting decided to completely stop the airing of any Indian channel in the country since none of them had landing rights in Pakistan. Mr Alam said the cable operators had been allowed to display two to five CD channels, but some of them were exceeding this limit and they had been warned and issued notices. In reply to a question, he said the punitive action would begin with fines and might lead to suspension and revocation of licences for repeated violations. He said the authority would write letters to the chief ministers for implementation of the Pemra decision with the help of police. The bidding for Pakistani DTH will be held by the end of October this year. The Pemra chairman also said that at the next stage action would be taken against the morning shows violating its code of conduct, adding that the authority had recently banned reenactment of crime-related incidents, but some channels had obtained stay order from court.

{"1281321": {"date": "September 03, 2016", "article": "Before Galileo, da Vinci and Newton, there were Ibn Hazim, Ibn Nafis, Al-Zahrawi and al-Khwarizmi. Who were they, you must be wondering. Well, it really is a shame that we all know people from the Western world who were pioneers, discoverers and trailblazers of their times and to whom the world owes much of its advancement. But when it comes to people of similar stature and deeds from the East and the Muslim world, we go blank. We do not know if there are people who made important discoveries that the world today owes its progress to or that there are so many things popular everywhere but which originated from Asia and the East.   Today we will look at some of the things that were introduced to the world by Muslims.Coffee The Muslims introduced coffee to the world. It arrived from Ethiopia to Yemen and the drink was found pleasant, so it began to spread from there to other places as well as to Makkah. As Muslims from far and wide visited the holy city, they took coffee to their country, thereby acquainting distant lands with this beverage. After it was introduced in Turkey, it made its way from here to Europe as Turkey did good business with Europe, coffee too, figured in the trade. It is believed to have reached Venice by 1645 and then westward from there to other parts of Europe. In 1650, a Turk by the name of Pasqua Rosee, opened a coffee shop on Lombard Street, London. The word coffee is derived from Arabic \u2018qaveh\u2019. In continental Europe it is called \u2018caf\u00e9\u2019.\n\n\n\nPinhole cameraIn ancient Greece, it was thought that the eyes emitted rays like laser, and that enabled one to see objects. It was a Muslim scientist who lived in the 10th century, Ibn-al-Haithan, who said that light entered the eyes and not the other way around. Al Haitham was a physicist, mathematician and astronomer. He discovered that light entering through a pin hole into a completely darkened box would create a picture at the back of the box. He called the box \u2018qamarah\u2019 from which the word \u2018camera\u2019 is derived. \n\n\n\nFirst parachuteIn 852, Abbas-ibn-Firnas, poet, astronomer, musician and engineer, built a cloak having wooden strips, allowing the cloak to spread out as birds\u2019 wings do when in flight. Although a resident of Baghdad, he moved to Cordoba in al Andalus (Muslim Spain). He climbed atop the minaret of the Grand Mosque of Cordoba and jumped from there. He didn\u2019t fly, but rather floated down to earth and crashed. However, the crash was not severe and he sustained minor injuries. The experiment showed the first \u2018parachute\u2019 in action. In 875, he built another flying machine using silk and eagle feathers. This time Ibn Firnas jumped from a mountainside. He did fly for a few minutes, but crashed again. Once again he sustained light injuries. He correctly noticed that absence of a tail resulted in the crash. Baghdad airport is named after him as well as a crater on the moon. \n\n\n\nChess A form of chess was played in India and made its way to Persia. Here, the game was perfected as we know it today. From Persia, the game spread east and west. It was introduced to al Andalus (Muslim Spain) in the 10th century and from there it found its way into Europe. The \u2018rook\u2019 of today\u2019s chess is really derived from Persian \u2018rukh\u2019 which means chariot.\n\n\n\nSoap Muslims were the first to introduce soap as it is known today. They used vegetable oil, sodium hydroxide and herbal oils. In its earliest forms, Egyptians and Romans used soaps of sort. In 1759, an Indian Muslim opened a bath in Brighton called \u2018Mohammad\u2019s Indian Vapour Bath\u2019. He was appointed \u2018Shampooing Surgeon\u2019 to King George IV and William IV.\n\n\n\nChemistryJabir ibn Hayyan was a scientist living in the ninth century. In the year 800, he changed alchemy into chemistry. Alchemy was based more on spiritual, magical and philosophical beliefs. Chemistry, on the other hand, is based on scientific facts, observations and experiments. He invented distillation, which is a means through which liquids are separated according to their boiling points. He also developed processes and apparatus for liquefaction, crystallisation, distillation, purification, oxidation, evaporation and filtration. Many of the processes and apparatus are still in use today. In addition, he also discovered sulphuric acid and nitric acid. He also invented the alembic still which could make intense rosewater as well as alcoholic spirits. His contribution to chemistry is so monumental that he is called the father of modern chemistry.\n\n\n\nMechanical engineering If Jabir ibn Hayyan is considered father of chemistry, then Ismail al-Jazzari (1136-1206), can be called the father of mechanical engineering.  He was the inventor and designer of many mechanical objects. Amongst his inventions is the crankshaft which converted rotary motion into linear motion. He wrote a book called \u2018The Book of Knowledge of Ingenious Mechanical Devices\u2019. He completed this book in 1206, a little before he died. He was familiar with the use of pistons and valves which were astonishing inventions for their time. These valves, pistons and crankshaft helped start the Industrial Revolution, first in Britain and later in Europe. He also developed the combination lock. Quilt Quilting is the sewing of insulating material between two pieces of cloth. It was the Crusaders who came across quilted fabric when they came in contact with the locals in Palestine, whom they called Saracens. Saracens were the Muslim soldiers battling the Crusaders. The clothes that the Saracens wore had quilt made of straw. This acted not only as insulation against the weather but also proved to be an effective protective armour. It was certainly much lighter than the iron armour the Crusaders used. The usefulness of the quilt was noticed by the Crusaders who brought back the idea to Europe where it was readily accepted. It was not long before quilting became a cottage industry in England and Holland.\n\n\n\nIslamic archesIslamic arches in buildings not only looked nice but they also provided structural strength to the building. This was in contrast to the round arches that were built by the Romans and adopted by Norman builders. As a result, the Islamic arches allowed construction of bigger and grander structures. Consequently, European designers borrowed heavily from the Islamic designs and this showed in the arches of Gothic cathedrals. In addition, European castles and forts also borrowed from Islamic designs of narrow arrow slits, battlements, parapets and barbicans. The architect of Henry V\u2019s castle was a Muslim.Surgical instruments The Muslim surgeon Al-Zahrawi developed surgical instruments which are still in use either in their original form or have been slightly modified. Al Zahrawi developed 200 surgical instruments. Some of these are scalpels, bone saws, forceps and fine scissors for eye surgery. He also discovered that cat guts were good for internal surgical stitching as they dissolved away naturally. Another medical scientist, Ibn al-Nafis, discovered blood circulation 300 years before William Harvey discovered it. Muslim scientists also developed anaesthesia using opium and alcohol. They also developed hollow needles for eye surgeries to suck out cataracts in a technique still used today. \n\n\n\nWindmillsWindmills first appeared in Persia in 634 and were used to grind corn and for the drawing of water for irrigation. From Persia the idea went to Arabia. These mills had six to 12 sails, covered either in cloth or palm leaves. Wind mills appeared 500 years later in Europe. \n\n\n\nVaccine Neither Jenner nor Pasteur introduced inoculation. This is actually a Turkish discovery for use to inoculate children against smallpox. The wife of the English ambassador to Turkey, Lady Mary Montague, brought the inoculations to Europe in 1724.  Smallpox vaccinations were being applied in Turkey 50 years before it was started in Europe.Numerals The numbering system probably originated in India but it was the Arabian mathematicians, Al-Khwarizmi and Al-Kindi, who created numerals which appeared first in around 825. Algebra was named after Al-Khwarizmi\u2019s book \u2018al Jabr wa\u2019al Muqabalah\u2019. Much of the contents of the book are still in use. An Italian mathematician, Fibonacci, was the first to introduce this mathematics to Europe. By doing so he introduced the continent to algorithm and trigonometry. Al-Kindi is credited with the discovery of frequency analysis. This discovery is the basis of cryptography. Cryptography means establishing codes in order to communicate without anyone knowing about the contents of the communication. Only authorised people can understand what is in the communication.\n\n\n\nCulinary artAli Ibn Nafi resided in Baghdad but moved to Cordoba (Muslim Spain) in the ninth century. He specialised in culinary art, introducing meals first with soup, followed by meat and vegetables and ended with nuts for dessert. He also introduced crystal glassware. Crystal glass had been created by Abbas ibn Firnas. The idea about meal and glassware was then introduced to Europe where it became popular. Persian carpetsPersian carpets having intricate designs and eye-catching colours, have always been in demand and as they were in the period called the Middle Ages (476-1500). These carpets commanded much value not only in Persia but also in Europe. The bright colours were the result of the development of chemicals and dyes which were unknown in Europe. Bank chequesBank cheques are considered a norm of life these days. How many know that the word \u2018cheque\u2019 originated from the Arabic \u2018saqq\u2019, which was basically a written vow to pay for goods when they were delivered. It is said that in the ninth century, a businessman could cash his cheque in China drawn on his bank in Baghdad. This \u2018cheque\u2019 system was introduced in Baghdad in the ninth century.Spherical EarthMuslim scholars of the ninth century had declared Earth to be a sphere and Ibn Hazm stated that Earth revolved around the Ssun and not the other way around. This fact also occurred to Galileo, but that was five centuries later. Muslim astronomers also calculated the circumference of Earth as 40,253 km, which was less than 200 km from the actual circumference that was later to be calculated.Muhammad Al Idrisi (1100-1165) was a geographer, cartographer and Egyptologist and lived in the court of King Rogers of Sicily. In 1139, he presented to the king a globe depicting Earth.Gun powderThe Chinese are credited with the invention of the gun powder. However, it was the Arabs who discovered a way of purifying it by using potassium nitrate. It proved to be effective for military purposes. The Crusaders found the devices fearsome. By the 15th century, Arab engineers had made interesting progress. They had devised a torpedo and rocket. Both were novelties of their time. The torpedo was really a device where an explosive charge was placed at the end of a lance. The propulsion was done by a large rocket that was attached to the torpedo. The lance would impale itself to the wooden ship\u2019s side and the explosive within the torpedo would blow up, sinking the ship.Flower gardensMedieval Europe boasted kitchen gardens. However, Muslim rulers of al Andalus developed beautiful flower gardens sometime in the 11th century. The idea was taken up readily by the Europeans. Carnations and tulips originated in al Andalus and made their way to European gardens.  \n\n\n\nFountain penThe Sultan of Egypt king wanted a pen that did not stain his clothes, as the pens at that time did, so the fountain pen was invented for him in 953.

Berger and the findings of other counter-extremism experts and government officials.\"White nationalists and Nazis outperformed ISIS in average friend and follower counts by a substantial margin,\" the report said.\"Nazis had a median follower count almost eight times greater than ISIS supporters, and a mean count more than 22 times greater.\" While Twitter has waged an aggressive campaign to suspend IS users - the company said in an August blog post it had shut down 360,000 accounts for threatening or promoting what it defined as terrorist acts since the middle of 2015 - Berger said in his report that \"white nationalists and Nazis operate with relative impunity.\"A Twitter spokesman declined to comment in advance of the release of the study. Reuters was unable to independently verify its findings.The report comes as Twitter faces scrutiny of its content removal policies. It has long been under pressure to crack down on Islamist fighters and their supporters, and the problem of harassment gained renewed attention in July after actress Leslie Jones briefly quit Twitter in the face of abusive comments.Berger said in an interview that Twitter and other companies such as Facebook Inc faced added difficulties in enforcing standards against white nationalist groups because they are less cohesive than IS networks and present greater free speech complications.The data collected, which included analysis of tweets of selected accounts and their followers, represents a fraction of the white nationalist presence on Twitter and was insufficient to estimate the overall online size of the groups, the report said.Accounts examined in the study possessed a strong affinity for US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, a prolific Twitter user who has been accused of retweeting accounts associated with white nationalism dozens of times.Three of the top 10 hashtags used most frequently by the data set of users studied were related to Trump, according to the report, entitled \"Nazis vs. ISIS on Twitter.\"Only #whitegenocide was more popular than Trump-related hashtags, the report said.The Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment. \n", "author": "Reuters", "title": "White nationalists use Twitter with 'relative impunity'"}}

The military court convicted terrorists were arrested from Swat for their involvement in attacks on security forces and maintaining contact with proscribed organisations. A two member bench of the PHC heard the application submitted by the relatives of the convicts.The bench stayed the execution after hearing the initial argument and asked the interior and defence ministries to submit details of the convicted terrorists by September 9. The application submitted by the relatives stated that it is not known when and where the trial was held.The black warrants for the convicts were signed by Chief of Army Staff General Raheel on August 16, 2016.Military courts\nIn the wake of the APS carnage, military courts were set up for trying terrorists under amendments made to the Constitution and the Army Act.Political parties had unanimously agreed over the issue of setting up military courts to tackle terrorism cases in the country following the gruesome attack on the Army Public School in Peshawar in December 2014, following which the Parliament passed the 21st constitutional amendment in Jan 2015 to set up the said courts.President Mamnoon Hussain had also promulgated an ordinance further revising the recently amended Army Act to ostensibly aid the functioning of military courts by allowing for trials in camera, i.e without the presence of the public or the media, and over video link if necessary.The Supreme Court in a majority ruling upheld the establishment of military courts in Pakistan.Petitions challenging the 21st amendment were dismissed in August this year in a majority 11-6 vote of the 17-member SC bench. Chief Justice Nasirul Mulk and Justice Dost Muhammad announced the verdict.In a 14-3 majority vote, petitions challenging the 18th amendment were also dismissed by the bench.
