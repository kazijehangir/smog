His well-wishers at the time reminded him that ultimately he would have to return to the party his elders, most prominent among them the one-time Punjab governor Chaudhry Altaf Hussain, had chosen to side with for long.The young man, who appeared to favour a career in politics over a promising stint at the bar, was destined to land in the PPP which his uncles had represented in Jhelum.

Fawad Chaudhry moved closer to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.

The water is expected to rise further and engineers at the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) are optimistic that it could even reach 310 feet. The peak or spill level at the dam is 339 feet and the reservoir capacity happens to be 600,000-acre feet. When filled to capacity, the Hub dam may supply water to Karachi for three years. The last time the dam filled to capacity was in 2013. After that it fell to dead level of 275.25. Things started looking up last year when the level rose again to 289 feet during monsoon. Still it couldn\u2019t fill up to the desired level. As a result of the recent increase in the level of water due to the recent rains, in June, July and August, especially in lower Sindh and the 250-kilometre radius around the dam\u2019s right side falling in the Kirthar Mountain Range in Balochistan from where the water flows downwards, things are beginning to look up for Karachi, which can now expect 100 million gallons per day (MGD) for over one year. The Hub dam used to be a major source of water supply to the city before the situation there grew from bad to worse. KWSB Chief Engineer, Bulk Water Supply, Sikandar Ali Zardari told Dawn that after reaching the spill level, 339ft, the dam also supplies around 33MGD to the Hub area in Balochistan. Karachi already receives 500MGD to 550MGD from the Indus river. But due to no supply from the Hub dam for the last three years to supplement the population\u2019s increasing need for water was giving rise to water theft by the tanker mafia as well as protests by the people facing a grave water shortage.

I\u2019m currently reading \u2018The Vegetarian\u2019, a novel by Korean author Han Kang. She tells the tale of a woman who suddenly finds eating meat grotesque and despicable. The interplay between her dreams and reality, issues with her husband and the society around her, sexuality and the meaninglessness of a humdrum existence, are all intricately interwoven by Han Kang. Besides that, something I continuously read on the side is classical and contemporary poetry. I always carry a Divan-i-Ghalib in my bag.Q: Do you prefer fiction to nonfiction?A: It is more about the quality of work and the interest it generates than the genre. Both in Urdu and in English, some of the works that inspired me most are works of nonfiction. For instance, I found an essay by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on Sufi Sarmad Shaheed informative, insightful and inspiring. Sarmad was a mystic in the 17th century Delhi killed by Emperor Aurangzeb because he supported the emperor\u2019s brother Dara Shikoh, who was an intellectual and a mystic himself. Let me also give an example from contemporary English writing. Last year I read \u2018The Nearest Thing to Life\u2019 by James Wood. This book of four essays attempts to explain the connection between fiction and life. Without understating his erudition, Wood uses his personal memories to create an absorbing narrative within the broad area of literary criticism.Q: Which living writers, poets, dramatists, do you admire the most?A: I like many. But let me mention J.M. Coetzee, Julian Barnes and Asad Mohammad Khan among living fiction writers. Coetzee\u2019s \u2018Disgrace\u2019 is a story of a middle aged professor of literature who, after having a fleeting affair with a young student, is disgracefully sacked from his job. The novel is set in South Africa and an incomparable expose of the human psyche blended with tragedy. \u2018The Noise of Time\u2019 is a novel by Julian Barnes that narrates the story of a music composer living in Soviet Union, first under the rule of Stalin and then Khrushchev. The muffling of voices, control and coercion, regulation of art and the fear instilled in the hearts of citizens by oppressive rulers is something that anyone who has lived under dictatorships or martial [law] can relate to.Contemporary Urdu fiction owes a lot to Asad Mohammad Khan. I find his language imaginative but accessible. His short stories have a pathos and humanism that is not found easily among his contemporaries. I particularly like his collections, Mutthi Bhar Aasman, Burj-i-Khamoshan and Ghussay Ki Nai Fasl.My favourite living Urdu poet is Fahmida Riaz; there is a distinct ingenuity in her language and idiom, themes and ideas. I also like Sarmad Sehbai, Iftikhar Arif, Kishwar Naheed, Mazhar Tirmazi and Khursheed Rizvi.Q: What do you plan to read next?A: In Urdu, Asif Farrukhi\u2019s Charagh-i-Shab-i-Afsana: Intizar Hussain Ka Jahan-i-Funn and Nasir Abbas Nayyer\u2019s Urdu Adab Ki Tashkeel-i-Jadeed are at the top of the list. Intizar Hussain was the last of the Mohicans when it comes to Urdu fiction of the 20th century. Farrukhi\u2019s book is the most comprehensive work to have appeared since Hussain\u2019s passing away. Also, I am eagerly waiting to begin Haruki Murakami\u2019s novel, \u2018Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage\u2019. It has been sitting on my desk for a long time.Q: What is your favourite piece of poetry?A: There is so much to cherish but I think Mir Taqi Mir\u2019s corpus of poetry is unparalleled, only to be contested, at times, by Ghalib.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Adeel Raza", "title": "From my bookshelf: \u2018It\u2019s more about quality of work than genre\u2019"}}

He said the federal government had set the November 15 deadline for the return of unregistered Afghans, while registered refugees could stay in the country until Dec 2016. \u201cThey (refugees) will not be disturbed until these deadlines end and that they will be treated as our guests,\u201d he said.Mr. Khattak said the provincial government would follow the guidelines of the federal government about Afghan nationals in future.\u201cIf an unregistered Afghan is apprehended in any operation during this period, the police will not register FIR against him or her,\u201d he said.
