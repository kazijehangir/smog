His well-wishers at the time reminded him that ultimately he would have to return to the party his elders, most prominent among them the one-time Punjab governor Chaudhry Altaf Hussain, had chosen to side with for long.The young man, who appeared to favour a career in politics over a promising stint at the bar, was destined to land in the PPP which his uncles had represented in Jhelum.

Fawad Chaudhry moved closer to Bilawal Bhutto Zardari.

The water is expected to rise further and engineers at the Karachi Water and Sewerage Board (KWSB) are optimistic that it could even reach 310 feet. The peak or spill level at the dam is 339 feet and the reservoir capacity happens to be 600,000-acre feet. When filled to capacity, the Hub dam may supply water to Karachi for three years. The last time the dam filled to capacity was in 2013. After that it fell to dead level of 275.25. Things started looking up last year when the level rose again to 289 feet during monsoon. Still it couldn\u2019t fill up to the desired level. As a result of the recent increase in the level of water due to the recent rains, in June, July and August, especially in lower Sindh and the 250-kilometre radius around the dam\u2019s right side falling in the Kirthar Mountain Range in Balochistan from where the water flows downwards, things are beginning to look up for Karachi, which can now expect 100 million gallons per day (MGD) for over one year. The Hub dam used to be a major source of water supply to the city before the situation there grew from bad to worse. KWSB Chief Engineer, Bulk Water Supply, Sikandar Ali Zardari told Dawn that after reaching the spill level, 339ft, the dam also supplies around 33MGD to the Hub area in Balochistan. Karachi already receives 500MGD to 550MGD from the Indus river. But due to no supply from the Hub dam for the last three years to supplement the population\u2019s increasing need for water was giving rise to water theft by the tanker mafia as well as protests by the people facing a grave water shortage.

I\u2019m currently reading \u2018The Vegetarian\u2019, a novel by Korean author Han Kang. She tells the tale of a woman who suddenly finds eating meat grotesque and despicable. The interplay between her dreams and reality, issues with her husband and the society around her, sexuality and the meaninglessness of a humdrum existence, are all intricately interwoven by Han Kang. Besides that, something I continuously read on the side is classical and contemporary poetry. I always carry a Divan-i-Ghalib in my bag.Q: Do you prefer fiction to nonfiction?A: It is more about the quality of work and the interest it generates than the genre. Both in Urdu and in English, some of the works that inspired me most are works of nonfiction. For instance, I found an essay by Maulana Abul Kalam Azad on Sufi Sarmad Shaheed informative, insightful and inspiring. Sarmad was a mystic in the 17th century Delhi killed by Emperor Aurangzeb because he supported the emperor\u2019s brother Dara Shikoh, who was an intellectual and a mystic himself. Let me also give an example from contemporary English writing. Last year I read \u2018The Nearest Thing to Life\u2019 by James Wood. This book of four essays attempts to explain the connection between fiction and life. Without understating his erudition, Wood uses his personal memories to create an absorbing narrative within the broad area of literary criticism.Q: Which living writers, poets, dramatists, do you admire the most?A: I like many. But let me mention J.M. Coetzee, Julian Barnes and Asad Mohammad Khan among living fiction writers. Coetzee\u2019s \u2018Disgrace\u2019 is a story of a middle aged professor of literature who, after having a fleeting affair with a young student, is disgracefully sacked from his job. The novel is set in South Africa and an incomparable expose of the human psyche blended with tragedy. \u2018The Noise of Time\u2019 is a novel by Julian Barnes that narrates the story of a music composer living in Soviet Union, first under the rule of Stalin and then Khrushchev. The muffling of voices, control and coercion, regulation of art and the fear instilled in the hearts of citizens by oppressive rulers is something that anyone who has lived under dictatorships or martial [law] can relate to.Contemporary Urdu fiction owes a lot to Asad Mohammad Khan. I find his language imaginative but accessible. His short stories have a pathos and humanism that is not found easily among his contemporaries. I particularly like his collections, Mutthi Bhar Aasman, Burj-i-Khamoshan and Ghussay Ki Nai Fasl.My favourite living Urdu poet is Fahmida Riaz; there is a distinct ingenuity in her language and idiom, themes and ideas. I also like Sarmad Sehbai, Iftikhar Arif, Kishwar Naheed, Mazhar Tirmazi and Khursheed Rizvi.Q: What do you plan to read next?A: In Urdu, Asif Farrukhi\u2019s Charagh-i-Shab-i-Afsana: Intizar Hussain Ka Jahan-i-Funn and Nasir Abbas Nayyer\u2019s Urdu Adab Ki Tashkeel-i-Jadeed are at the top of the list. Intizar Hussain was the last of the Mohicans when it comes to Urdu fiction of the 20th century. Farrukhi\u2019s book is the most comprehensive work to have appeared since Hussain\u2019s passing away. Also, I am eagerly waiting to begin Haruki Murakami\u2019s novel, \u2018Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage\u2019. It has been sitting on my desk for a long time.Q: What is your favourite piece of poetry?A: There is so much to cherish but I think Mir Taqi Mir\u2019s corpus of poetry is unparalleled, only to be contested, at times, by Ghalib.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Adeel Raza", "title": "From my bookshelf: \u2018It\u2019s more about quality of work than genre\u2019"}}

The three pillars of the external sector \u2014 remittances, exports and foreign direct investment \u2014 have all shown steep declines in the first month of the new fiscal year. This could be bad news if the trend were to continue.Remittances have been the backbone of the external sector for more than half a decade now, registering constant increases even as the countries from where they originate have gone through deep crises. But in July they fell by 20pc where the same figure for last year was less than 1pc.Granted some of this drop can be attributed to Brexit-related problems, such as the depreciation of the pound sterling. But all countries have shown steep declines: UK down by 38pc, US by 33pc, Saudi Arabia by 30pc, UAE by 20pc, and other GCC countries by 14pc. Between them, these countries alone account for almost 90pc of our total remittances.Exports similarly fell by just over 14pc in July compared to the same month last year, as per State Bank data. This is a continuation of a trend that began in July 2013. Since then, every July has shown declines, totalling to almost 30pc over the three years since. We have heard much talk from the government about tackling this trend and spattering of a few measures here and there, but nothing more.Foreign direct investment makes for a slightly more dismal read. On the face of it the numbers look spectacular. Apparently, we saw a 125pc increase in foreign investment in July this year! But look a little closer and you\u2019ll realise something. Of the $63 million that came in during the month as foreign investment, $54m was in the stock market. Where it really counts, inflows of foreign direct investment, there was a drop of 48pc. \nSo where is the game plan for \u201caccelerating competitiveness and business climate reforms\u201d, you might well ask?\n\nOne month\u2019s data may not be bad news if it was seasonal or accounted for by temporary circumstances. But the situation that lies behind these declines is neither. It is reasonable to say that these declines are here to stay. To some extent this is also to be expected. After all, countries around the world are seeing declines of this sort given the deterioration in the world economy, and the declining price of oil, which has created dire economic circumstances in key countries of the advanced industrial world and the oil rich kingdoms of the Middle East.The reason this is more worrying than usual are twofold. First, this is the year we exit the IMF programme, and from here on till the next government inevitably enters a new programme, we are on our own. So the kind of ideas and thinking that the government is bringing to bear on this situation is important. How is the government seeing the situation on the external sector? The words of the finance minister in the latest budget speech provide a clue. Here he is, for instance, talking about the foreign exchange reserves: \u201cAlhamdolillah, the level of $21.6 billion has been achieved, which is a new historic record. And this way we have guarded the economy from frequent external fluctuations.\u201dIt would be a good idea to recall here that the finance minister from the previous government was also boasting of building \u201crecord high reserves\u201d in 2011. Here is what he said in the budget speech that year: \u201c[T]he country has accumulated historic reserves of $17.3bn and the rupee has displayed stability.\u201d Two years later, Pakistan was once again preparing its approach to the IMF. So much for \u201crecord high reserves\u201d.Back to Mr Dar. Here he is talking about exports, after noting the declines that set in since his government came into power: \u201cThe main reason for this decline is global commodity prices.\u201dIncidentally, when detailing the reasons behind declining exports, the IMF has a little more to say. Here are the reasons they give in the last review \u2014 \u201clower commodity prices, security and business climate challenges, and the continued appreciation of the real effective exchange rate\u201d.In his attached Letter of Intent, which details the challenges the government sees for itself and the steps it intends to take to meet them, the finance minister says \u201c[t]he decline in exports and the need to promote private investment call for accelerating competitiveness and business climate reforms\u201d.So where is the game plan for \u201caccelerating competitiveness and business climate reforms\u201d, you might well ask? Considering this is being said in the last review of the programme, when exports have already put in a declining trend continuously for three years, one can be excused for thinking that the government is talking more and doing less.The fact is, almost all of the government\u2019s initiatives to reform governance and the economy have met with failure. These include but are not limited to the agriculture package of last year, the auto policy of this year, the banking transaction tax as a documentation measure, the effort to serve notices on non-filers of income tax returns and the tax amnesty scheme for traders. Faced with such a comprehensive catalogue of failures, there is little left now but to go on about the \u201crecord high reserves\u201d and CPEC. The latter has become some sort of holy grail in our public imagination, so thoroughly is the future of the country being cast in its light. Only the other day, Ahsan Iqbal insisted that CPEC is not just a game changer, but a \u201cfate changer\u201d. I wonder what\u2019s next \u2014 perhaps a \u2018destiny shaper\u2019?At the moment, CPEC is more of a mystery than anything else.

The three pillars of the external sector \u2014 remittances, exports and foreign direct investment \u2014 have all shown steep declines in the first month of the new fiscal year. This could be bad news if the trend were to continue.Remittances have been the backbone of the external sector for more than half a decade now, registering constant increases even as the countries from where they originate have gone through deep crises. But in July they fell by 20pc where the same figure for last year was less than 1pc.Granted some of this drop can be attributed to Brexit-related problems, such as the depreciation of the pound sterling. But all countries have shown steep declines: UK down by 38pc, US by 33pc, Saudi Arabia by 30pc, UAE by 20pc, and other GCC countries by 14pc. Between them, these countries alone account for almost 90pc of our total remittances.Exports similarly fell by just over 14pc in July compared to the same month last year, as per State Bank data. This is a continuation of a trend that began in July 2013. Since then, every July has shown declines, totalling to almost 30pc over the three years since. We have heard much talk from the government about tackling this trend and spattering of a few measures here and there, but nothing more.Foreign direct investment makes for a slightly more dismal read. On the face of it the numbers look spectacular. Apparently, we saw a 125pc increase in foreign investment in July this year! But look a little closer and you\u2019ll realise something. Of the $63 million that came in during the month as foreign investment, $54m was in the stock market. Where it really counts, inflows of foreign direct investment, there was a drop of 48pc. \nSo where is the game plan for \u201caccelerating competitiveness and business climate reforms\u201d, you might well ask?\n\nOne month\u2019s data may not be bad news if it was seasonal or accounted for by temporary circumstances. But the situation that lies behind these declines is neither. It is reasonable to say that these declines are here to stay. To some extent this is also to be expected. After all, countries around the world are seeing declines of this sort given the deterioration in the world economy, and the declining price of oil, which has created dire economic circumstances in key countries of the advanced industrial world and the oil rich kingdoms of the Middle East.The reason this is more worrying than usual are twofold. First, this is the year we exit the IMF programme, and from here on till the next government inevitably enters a new programme, we are on our own. So the kind of ideas and thinking that the government is bringing to bear on this situation is important. How is the government seeing the situation on the external sector? The words of the finance minister in the latest budget speech provide a clue. Here he is, for instance, talking about the foreign exchange reserves: \u201cAlhamdolillah, the level of $21.6 billion has been achieved, which is a new historic record. And this way we have guarded the economy from frequent external fluctuations.\u201dIt would be a good idea to recall here that the finance minister from the previous government was also boasting of building \u201crecord high reserves\u201d in 2011. Here is what he said in the budget speech that year: \u201c[T]he country has accumulated historic reserves of $17.3bn and the rupee has displayed stability.\u201d Two years later, Pakistan was once again preparing its approach to the IMF. So much for \u201crecord high reserves\u201d.Back to Mr Dar. Here he is talking about exports, after noting the declines that set in since his government came into power: \u201cThe main reason for this decline is global commodity prices.\u201dIncidentally, when detailing the reasons behind declining exports, the IMF has a little more to say. Here are the reasons they give in the last review \u2014 \u201clower commodity prices, security and business climate challenges, and the continued appreciation of the real effective exchange rate\u201d.In his attached Letter of Intent, which details the challenges the government sees for itself and the steps it intends to take to meet them, the finance minister says \u201c[t]he decline in exports and the need to promote private investment call for accelerating competitiveness and business climate reforms\u201d.So where is the game plan for \u201caccelerating competitiveness and business climate reforms\u201d, you might well ask? Considering this is being said in the last review of the programme, when exports have already put in a declining trend continuously for three years, one can be excused for thinking that the government is talking more and doing less.The fact is, almost all of the government\u2019s initiatives to reform governance and the economy have met with failure. These include but are not limited to the agriculture package of last year, the auto policy of this year, the banking transaction tax as a documentation measure, the effort to serve notices on non-filers of income tax returns and the tax amnesty scheme for traders. Faced with such a comprehensive catalogue of failures, there is little left now but to go on about the \u201crecord high reserves\u201d and CPEC. The latter has become some sort of holy grail in our public imagination, so thoroughly is the future of the country being cast in its light. Only the other day, Ahsan Iqbal insisted that CPEC is not just a game changer, but a \u201cfate changer\u201d. I wonder what\u2019s next \u2014 perhaps a \u2018destiny shaper\u2019?At the moment, CPEC is more of a mystery than anything else. The reality is described by those three lines that July data showed trending downwards. The failure to address that reality is what will decide whether the present moment is a \u201cfate changer\u201d or a \u201chistory repeater\u201d.

I am hopeful that the KP government will restore the tax after listening to us,\u201d he said.The nazim said the granite excavating companies were responsible for the destruction of the main and link roads in tehsil.\u201cIf we are allowed to get the mineral transportation tax waived by the provincial government, we\u2019ll spend the money for the welfare of the people in tehsil,\u201d he said.TROUBLEMAKERS HELD: The Oghi police on Wednesday arrested 21 people under Section 16 of the Maintenance of Public Order for blocking the execution of a water scheme on a stream in their area.Assistant commissioner Altaf Hussain and other relevant officials had gone to Darra Shyna area of Oghi to execute the scheme on the order of a local court but the local residents, including women, stopped them.The police took 36 people into custody for disturbing peace and sent 21 of them to jail under 16 Maintenance of Public Order.Local MPA Ibrar Tanoli had sanctioned Rs10 million for the water supply scheme but the people of Darra Shyna area objected to it.The people of Chunjli Miangan, Phal, Dogha, Davil Muee later moved a local court against the people of Darra Shyna. The court ordered the tehsil administration and police to ensure the smooth execution of water supply schemes.DSP Nazir Ahmad said troublemakers would be dealt with strictly under the law.Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "The Newspaper's Correspondent", "title": "Probe into embezzlement of funds demanded"}}

However, following the amendments all these functions have been handed over to the directorate general.The commissioners said that sections of original law should have been amended suitably in order to make these consistent with Section 9-C of the act, which has not been done and anomalies created.Under sub-section(c) of Section 9 of the original act the commission was authorised to approve annual budget of the commission; however, now after the amendment it will approve annual budget of the commission, directorate general and Ehtesab courts.They have also questioned the wisdom of restricting KPEC mandate to investigate cases over monetary limit of Rs. \n50 million and above under Section 35 and noted that it would further create anomalies and extending undue benefits to the accused. \u201cThis would result in mitigation of intensity of the act,\u201d it reads.They also pointed out that Section 36(6) which says that in case of delay in inquiry the reasons should be in writing presented to the commission. Under recent amendments this report would be presented to directorate general.The commissioners said that it would pointless to report delay in inquiry to directorate general itself by the director general.Also anomalies have been pointed out in sections 17, 36(2) and 37(4).KPEC Act has turned into a subject of controversy since the beginning of this year. On February 9, 2016, the government promulgated the KPEC Ordinance 2016, drastically amending the law, which resulted into resignation of the then DG, retired general Hamid Khan, in February.However, after much criticism, the ordinance was withdrawn on May 2.Another amendment bill was tabled in the KP Assembly on May 6 and a version of it modified by a select committee of house was passed by the house on August 3.Officials both at the commission and directorate general were not available for comments to the objections to the recent KPEC law amendments.Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Manzoor Ali", "title": "Amendments to KPEC Act stir controversy"}}

Therefore, all vets, health professionals, healthy populations in the disease area and all investigating teams are at a great risk (of catching virus), if they are without proper gadgets, as prescribed by the BSL4 laboratories and as mentioned in WHO guidelines,\u201d reads the report compiled by a team of the University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences (UVAS) Lahore, after it visited Dhok Shah Gul Hassan, Kot Qazi Union Council of Tala Gang Tehsil of Chakwal.The team headed by UVAS parasitology department chairman Prof Dr Kamran Ashraf, comprised Astt Prof Dr Muhammad Oneeb and PG scholar Zulfiqar Ahmad, (both from parasitology department). It was assisted by Chakwal district livestock department officials.The team visited the house of the suspected victim\u2019s house, met her husband Sarfaraz and took details of the illness of his deceased wife. Sarfaraz too had shown Congo fever symptoms but he got recovered, the report said.It observed that the couple had continuous contact with the animals having ticks kept in their house. It said 90pc female members of the families in the area were involved in rearing animals, mostly crossbred cows which were more prone to ticks than local breeds, besides sheep and goats.The report said on physical examination, ticks were found on both cows of the victim\u2019s family, but there were no ticks on small animals. These ticks were collected for further identification.The team visited the whole area to check the livestock for tick load, type of ticks and especially for any presence of Hyalomma vector (Congo fever tick) in the area.\u201cAs per discussion with Mr Sarfarz, her wife was having a close interaction with the animals for milking on a daily basis. And ticks infestation is the common problem in their animals. Similarly, other larger animals were also having tick infestation. On microscopic examination of the ticks collected, specially from the house of Mr Sarfraz and whole area, two tick genera were identified -- Hyalomma (suspected vector of Congo Fever) and Boophilus among Hyalomma the species identified seems like Hyalomma anatolicum and Hyalomma marginatum,\u201d the report reads.It says that despite regular use of acaricidals (anti-tick drugs) the continuing problem of tick infestation highlights the possible risk of acaricidal resistance which increases due to self-medication by the animal owners. It mentions that imported pour-on drugs and injections were found to be more effective than local ones.The report mentions that hygiene of animals was not up to the mark and the sheds were presenting ideal conditions for tick breeding.\u201cThe large-scale screening of the animals and their premises (sheds) should be done to check the livestock for ticks load, type of ticks and specifically the presence of Hyalomma in other areas of Punjab as well,\u201d it recommends.It suggests improvement in overall keeping of the animals to help minimise the hiding and breeding places of ticks. It advises against irrational use of acaricidals and self-medication by animal owners.It recommends that along with use of injectable and pour-on drugs for animals, their sheds should also be regularly sprayed with insecticides, suggesting use of alternate herbal and biological tick control strategies.The report also recommends short trainings, workshops and refresher courses for livestock and dairy development staff to identify different tick genera and species in the field as a precautionary step.It recommends establishment of a proper laboratory with up to the mark bio security measures for molecular identification and screening of ticks transmitting Congo virus to help avoid outbreak of such diseases in future.\u201cIt is very important to establish BSL (Biosecurity Level) 3 and 4 laboratories for research and disease control to curb such highly contagious diseases which can be very fatal for human population,\u201d it says.While issuing a public health advice, the report recommends reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission. It advises use of protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers, gloves), light coloured clothing for easy detection\nof ticks, use of approved acaricides on clothes, repellents on skin and clothing, besides regular examination of clothes and human skin for ticks. If found, the ticks should be removed safely.It suggests elimination of ticks on animals and also in stables and barns, especially during the breeding season when they are most active.It further advises use of hand gloves and other protective gear while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home.The report suggests quarantining of animals before they are brought to slaughterhouses or routinely treating them with pesticides two weeks prior to slaughter.To reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission, it also warns against close physical contact with infected people and suggests use of gloves and other protective gear when taking care of sick people, and \u201cwashing hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people\u201d.

The controversial land grab in Singur in West Bengal had marked a rightward slide of the once celebrated Communist Party of India (Marxist, CPM), which many see as now offering nationalist slogans to retrieve its domain in Kolkata. That the Supreme Court quashed the land acquisition effected by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharya-led CPM government in 2006 for allotting it to Tata to set up its Nano car factory came as a withering response by the \u201cbourgeois\u201d state the communists had mocked. The court held that the acquisition could not be said to be for a \u201cpublic purpose\u201d and hence the land should be remitted back to farmers within 12 weeks. Where the CPM was the anchor of India\u2019s mature and responsible policies with its neighbours, apart from pioneering land reforms, reports on Sunday revealed the party\u2019s regressive vocabulary. According to the Times of India, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday compared Pakistan to vultures, saying the neighbouring country is trying to reap advantages of the bloodshed in the Kashmir Valley during its longest curfew period. \u201cPakistan is like a vulture. Vultures fly high in the sky. They spot bodies only if they see blood on the ground. But we need to ask our government why blood is flowing on the ground. Let us go and talk to the Kashmiris. A dialogue between them and the government can resolve the issue,\u201d said Yechury, in an address to CPM workers.  Sections of the Indian media had earlier criticised Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar for describing Pakistan as a veritable hell.

{"1281170": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe writer is a member of staff.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nA STRING of bad data is casting a cloud over the external sector outlook precisely at the time when Pakistan prepares to exit the Fund programme. The three pillars of the external sector \u2014 remittances, exports and foreign direct investment \u2014 have all shown steep declines in the first month of the new fiscal year. This could be bad news if the trend were to continue.Remittances have been the backbone of the external sector for more than half a decade now, registering constant increases even as the countries from where they originate have gone through deep crises. But in July they fell by 20pc where the same figure for last year was less than 1pc.Granted some of this drop can be attributed to Brexit-related problems, such as the depreciation of the pound sterling. But all countries have shown steep declines: UK down by 38pc, US by 33pc, Saudi Arabia by 30pc, UAE by 20pc, and other GCC countries by 14pc. Between them, these countries alone account for almost 90pc of our total remittances.Exports similarly fell by just over 14pc in July compared to the same month last year, as per State Bank data. This is a continuation of a trend that began in July 2013. Since then, every July has shown declines, totalling to almost 30pc over the three years since. We have heard much talk from the government about tackling this trend and spattering of a few measures here and there, but nothing more.Foreign direct investment makes for a slightly more dismal read. On the face of it the numbers look spectacular. Apparently, we saw a 125pc increase in foreign investment in July this year! But look a little closer and you\u2019ll realise something. Of the $63 million that came in during the month as foreign investment, $54m was in the stock market. Where it really counts, inflows of foreign direct investment, there was a drop of 48pc. \nSo where is the game plan for \u201caccelerating competitiveness and business climate reforms\u201d, you might well ask?\n\nOne month\u2019s data may not be bad news if it was seasonal or accounted for by temporary circumstances. But the situation that lies behind these declines is neither. It is reasonable to say that these declines are here to stay. To some extent this is also to be expected. After all, countries around the world are seeing declines of this sort given the deterioration in the world economy, and the declining price of oil, which has created dire economic circumstances in key countries of the advanced industrial world and the oil rich kingdoms of the Middle East.The reason this is more worrying than usual are twofold. First, this is the year we exit the IMF programme, and from here on till the next government inevitably enters a new programme, we are on our own. So the kind of ideas and thinking that the government is bringing to bear on this situation is important. How is the government seeing the situation on the external sector? The words of the finance minister in the latest budget speech provide a clue. Here he is, for instance, talking about the foreign exchange reserves: \u201cAlhamdolillah, the level of $21.6 billion has been achieved, which is a new historic record. And this way we have guarded the economy from frequent external fluctuations.\u201dIt would be a good idea to recall here that the finance minister from the previous government was also boasting of building \u201crecord high reserves\u201d in 2011.

Kim was killed by a firing squad in July as \u201can anti-party, anti-revolutionary agitator\u201d, claimed an official at the ministry, who declined to be named. \u201cKim Yong-Jin was denounced for his bad sitting posture when he was sitting below the rostrum\u201d during a session of North Korea\u2019s parliament, and then underwent an interrogation that revealed other \u201ccrimes\u201d, the official told reporters.

One of them was Kim Yong-Chol, a top official in charge of inter-Korean affairs and espionage activities against the South. The 71-year-old Kim is a career military intelligence official who is believed to be the mastermind behind the North\u2019s frequent cyber-attacks on Seoul. Kim is also blamed by the South for the sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010 near the disputed sea border with the North in the Yellow Sea.

Sindh had produced many great men of letters and wisdom and Leghari was one of them, he said.Prof Qalandar Shah Lakyari said that Legahri adopted faqiri and humbleness in a bid to change for better the stained history of Legahri nawabs because faqiri was immortal while nawwabi was temporary.Qadir Bux Talibani said that Legahri was like an open university who educated more men outside his classroom than inside the room and he never believed in teaching men while sitting in his chair. Faiz Nizamani said that Leghari taught in such a fascinating and captivating manner that a student would literally forget taking a breath for fear he might miss something his beloved teacher was explaining.He said that in Sindh, so much scorn had been poured on the words ustad and master and the two words had been so much ridiculed that new words and terms should be coined for this respectable and noble profession. Taj Joyo, Naseer Mirza, Prof Noor Ahmed Janjhi and Nafees Ahmed Sheikh said that Legahri was a unique person, a source of knowledge and wisdom, and an embodiment of humanity.Sikandar Leghari, Hyder Leghari\u2019s brother, shared his memories about the beloved kin with the audience and said that he inspired many students and sincerely devoted all his energies and talents to the field of education.

It advises against irrational use of acaricidals and self-medication by animal owners.It recommends that along with use of injectable and pour-on drugs for animals, their sheds should also be regularly sprayed with insecticides, suggesting use of alternate herbal and biological tick control strategies.The report also recommends short trainings, workshops and refresher courses for livestock and dairy development staff to identify different tick genera and species in the field as a precautionary step.It recommends establishment of a proper laboratory with up to the mark bio security measures for molecular identification and screening of ticks transmitting Congo virus to help avoid outbreak of such diseases in future.\u201cIt is very important to establish BSL (Biosecurity Level) 3 and 4 laboratories for research and disease control to curb such highly contagious diseases which can be very fatal for human population,\u201d it says.While issuing a public health advice, the report recommends reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission. It advises use of protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers, gloves), light coloured clothing for easy detection\nof ticks, use of approved acaricides on clothes, repellents on skin and clothing, besides regular examination of clothes and human skin for ticks. If found, the ticks should be removed safely.It suggests elimination of ticks on animals and also in stables and barns, especially during the breeding season when they are most active.It further advises use of hand gloves a{"1281130": {"date": "Updated August 31, 2016", "article": "KARACHI: The world's largest photography competition, 'Wiki Loves Monuments' will kick off in Pakistan on Sept 1, 2016.

The three pillars of the external sector \u2014 remittances, exports and foreign direct investment \u2014 have all shown steep declines in the first month of the new fiscal year. This could be bad news if the trend were to continue.Remittances have been the backbone of the external sector for more than half a decade now, registering constant increases even as the countries from where they originate have gone through deep crises. But in July they fell by 20pc where the same figure for last year was less than 1pc.Granted some of this drop can be attributed to Brexit-related problems, such as the depreciation of the pound sterling. But all countries have shown steep declines: UK down by 38pc, US by 33pc, Saudi Arabia by 30pc, UAE by 20pc, and other GCC countries by 14pc. Between them, these countries alone account for almost 90pc of our total remittances.Exports similarly fell by just over 14pc in July compared to the same month last year, as per State Bank data. This is a continuation of a trend that began in July 2013. Since then, every July has shown declines, totalling to almost 30pc over the three years since. We have heard much talk from the government about tackling this trend and spattering of a few measures here and there, but nothing more.Foreign direct investment makes for a slightly more dismal read. On the face of it the numbers look spectacular. Apparently, we saw a 125pc increase in foreign investment in July this year! But look a little closer and you\u2019ll realise something. Of the $63 million that came in during the month as foreign investment, $54m was in the stock market. Where it really counts, inflows of foreign direct investment, there was a drop of 48pc. \nSo where is the game plan for \u201caccelerating competitiveness and business climate reforms\u201d, you might well ask?\n\nOne month\u2019s data may not be bad news if it was seasonal or accounted for by temporary circumstances. But the situation that lies behind these declines is neither. It is reasonable to say that these declines are here to stay. To some extent this is also to be expected. After all, countries around the world are seeing declines of this sort given the deterioration in the world economy, and the declining price of oil, which has created dire economic circumstances in key countries of the advanced industrial world and the oil rich kingdoms of the Middle East.The reason this is more worrying than usual are twofold. First, this is the year we exit the IMF programme, and from here on till the next government inevitably enters a new programme, we are on our own. So the kind of ideas and thinking that the government is bringing to bear on this situation is important. How is the government seeing the situation on the external sector? The words of the finance minister in the latest budget speech provide a clue. Here he is, for instance, talking about the foreign exchange reserves: \u201cAlhamdolillah, the level of $21.6 billion has been achieved, which is a new historic record. And this way we have guarded the economy from frequent external fluctuations.\u201dIt would be a good idea to recall here that the finance minister from the previous government was also boasting of building \u201crecord high reserves\u201d in 2011. Here is what he said in the budget speech that year: \u201c[T]he country has accumulated historic reserves of $17.3bn and the rupee has displayed stability.\u201d Two years later, Pakistan was once again preparing its approach to the IMF. So much for \u201crecord high reserves\u201d.Back to Mr Dar. Here he is talking about exports, after noting the declines that set in since his government came into power: \u201cThe main reason for this decline is global commodity prices.\u201dIncidentally, when detailing the reasons behind declining exports, the IMF has a little more to say. Here are the reasons they give in the last review \u2014 \u201clower commodity prices, security and business climate challenges, and the continued appreciation of the real effective exchange rate\u201d.In his attached Letter of Intent, which details the challenges the government sees for itself and the steps it intends to take to meet them, the finance minister says \u201c[t]he decline in exports and the need to promote private investment call for accelerating competitiveness and business climate reforms\u201d.So where is the game plan for \u201caccelerating competitiveness and business climate reforms\u201d, you might well ask? Considering this is being said in the last review of the programme, when exports have already put in a declining trend continuously for three years, one can be excused for thinking that the government is talking more and doing less.The fact is, almost all of the government\u2019s initiatives to reform governance and the economy have met with failure. These include but are not limited to the agriculture package of last year, the auto policy of this year, the banking transaction tax as a documentation measure, the effort to serve notices on non-filers of income tax returns and the tax amnesty scheme for traders. Faced with such a comprehensive catalogue of failures, there is little left now but to go on about the \u201crecord high reserves\u201d and CPEC. The latter has become some sort of holy grail in our public imagination, so thoroughly is the future of the country being cast in its light. Only the other day, Ahsan Iqbal insisted that CPEC is not just a game changer, but a \u201cfate changer\u201d. I wonder what\u2019s next \u2014 perhaps a \u2018destiny shaper\u2019?At the moment, CPEC is more of a mystery than anything else. The reality is described by those three lines that July data showed trending downwards. The failure to address that reality is what will decide whether the present moment is a \u201cfate changer\u201d or a \u201chistory repeater\u201d.

Only the other day, Ahsan Iqbal insisted that CPEC is not just a game changer, but a \u201cfate changer\u201d. I wonder what\u2019s next \u2014 perhaps a \u2018destiny shaper\u2019?At the moment, CPEC is more of a mystery than anything else. The reality is described by those three lines that July data showed trending downwards. The failure to address that reality is what will decide whether the present moment is a \u201cfate changer\u201d or a \u201chistory repeater\u201d.

Groin injuries have been hampering Steyn and a serious shoulder problem meant he missed the series against Eng\u00adland in December and January.

However, following the amendments all these functions have been handed over to the directorate general.The commissioners said that sections of original law should have been amended suitably in order to make these consistent with Section 9-C of the act, which has not been done and anomalies created.Under sub-section(c) of Section 9 of the original act the commission was authorised to approve annual budget of the commission; however, now after the amendment it will approve annual budget of the commission, directorate general and Ehtesab courts.They have also questioned the wisdom of restricting KPEC mandate to investigate cases over monetary limit of Rs. \n50 million and above under Section 35 and noted that it would further create anomalies and extending undue benefits to the accused. \u201cThis would result in mitigation of intensity of the act,\u201d it reads.They also pointed out that Section 36(6) which says that in case of delay in inquiry the reasons should be in writing presented to the commission.

On February 9, 2016, the government promulgated the KPEC Ordinance 2016, drastically amending the law, which resulted into resignation of the then DG, retired general Hamid Khan, in February.However, after much criticism, the ordinance was withdrawn on May 2.Another amendment bill was tabled in the KP Assembly on May 6 and a version of it modified by a select committee of house was passed by the house on August 3.Officials both at the commission and directorate general were not available for comments to the objections to the recent KPEC law amendments.Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Manzoor Ali", "title": "Amendments to KPEC Act stir controversy"}}

It mentions that imported pour-on drugs and injections were found to be more effective than local ones.The report mentions that hygiene of animals was not up to the mark and the sheds were presenting ideal conditions for tick breeding.\u201cThe large-scale screening of the animals and their premises (sheds) should be done to check the livestock for ticks load, type of ticks and specifically the presence of Hyalomma in other areas of Punjab as well,\u201d it recommends.It suggests improvement in overall keeping of the animals to help minimise the hiding and breeding places of ticks. It advises against irrational use of acaricidals and self-medication by animal owners.It recommends that along with use of injectable and pour-on drugs for animals, their sheds should also be regularly sprayed with insecticides, suggesting use of alternate herbal and biological tick control strategies.The report also recommends short trainings, workshops and refresher courses for livestock and dairy development staff to identify different tick genera and species in the field as a precautionary step.It recommends establishment of a proper laboratory with up to the mark bio security measures for molecular identification and screening of ticks transmitting Congo virus to help avoid outbreak of such diseases in future.\u201cIt is very important to establish BSL (Biosecurity Level) 3 and 4 laboratories for research and disease control to curb such highly contagious diseases which can be very fatal for human population,\u201d it says.While issuing a public health advice, the report recommends reducing the risk of tick-to-human transmission. It advises use of protective clothing (long sleeves, long trousers, gloves), light coloured clothing for easy detection\nof ticks, use of approved acaricides on clothes, repellents on skin and clothing, besides regular examination of clothes and human skin for ticks. If found, the ticks should be removed safely.It suggests elimination of ticks on animals and also in stables and barns, especially during the breeding season when they are most active.It further advises use of hand gloves and other protective gear while handling animals or their tissues in endemic areas, notably during slaughtering, butchering and culling procedures in slaughterhouses or at home.The report suggests quarantining of animals before they are brought to slaughterhouses or routinely treating them with pesticides two weeks prior to slaughter.To reduce the risk of human-to-human transmission, it also warns against close physical contact with infected people and suggests use of gloves and other protective gear when taking care of sick people, and \u201cwashing hands regularly after caring for or visiting ill people\u201d.

The controversial land grab in Singur in West Bengal had marked a rightward slide of the once celebrated Communist Party of India (Marxist, CPM), which many see as now offering nationalist slogans to retrieve its domain in Kolkata. That the Supreme Court quashed the land acquisition effected by the Buddhadeb Bhattacharya-led CPM government in 2006 for allotting it to Tata to set up its Nano car factory came as a withering response by the \u201cbourgeois\u201d state the communists had mocked. The court held that the acquisition could not be said to be for a \u201cpublic purpose\u201d and hence the land should be remitted back to farmers within 12 weeks. Where the CPM was the anchor of India\u2019s mature and responsible policies with its neighbours, apart from pioneering land reforms, reports on Sunday revealed the party\u2019s regressive vocabulary. According to the Times of India, CPM general secretary Sitaram Yechury on Sunday compared Pakistan to vultures, saying the neighbouring country is trying to reap advantages of the bloodshed in the Kashmir Valley during its longest curfew period. \u201cPakistan is like a vulture. Vultures fly high in the sky. They spot bodies only if they see blood on the ground. But we need to ask our government why blood is flowing on the ground. Let us go and talk to the Kashmiris.

According to the Supreme Court\u2019s order, farmers who got compensation from the government will not return it because they were deprived of their livelihood for the last ten years.  The court order signifies a major victory for West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee, the CPM\u2019s b\u00eate noir, who had led the protests against allocation of land for the Tata factory. While setting aside the Calcutta High Court order of upholding the acquisition process, the Supreme Court bench ruled that the acquisition was bad in law on several grounds and that acquiring the land from the farmers for giving it to a company for a car plant could not come under the ambit of \u201cpublic purpose\u201d.
