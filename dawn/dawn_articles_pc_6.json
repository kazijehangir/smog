Altaf Hussain\u2019s latest harangue through telephonic addresses to MQM workers in America and South Africa lends credence to these theories.  This arrangement was, perhaps, necessary to ensure the success of the party\u2019s candidate for city mayor in the elections held a few days later. Waseem Akhtar, who was nominated with the approval of Altaf Hussain months ago, swept the polls easily with not a single MQM vote wasted. Any reaction from London against the decision of the Pakistan-based committee would have divided the party which could have caused it to lose control of the city government. By separating the Karachi and London committees, the MQM has apparently escaped the possibility of being banned. Almost all the major political parties are opposed to any move that could lead to the disintegration of the party into splinters thus strengthening militancy. For sure, the ongoing Rangers operation in Karachi has crippled the party\u2019s militant wing and contained its capacity to bring the city to a halt as it did frequently in the past. But the party is still deeply entrenched in the city and its vote bank has remained intact as demonstrated in the local government polls and various by-elections. The creation of the Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) led by Mustafa Kamal may have made some dents in the MQM but it has failed to make much of an impact on the city\u2019s politics largely because of the perception of it being sponsored by the security establishment as part of a plan to re-engineer Karachi\u2019s politics. The latest crisis in the MQM may result in PSP support for some more defectors, but there is little possibility of it making any inroads into the hard-core Urdu-speaking vote bank. Such political manipulations by the security agencies have failed in the past too. In fact, the Rangers\u2019 revenge action following Aug 22 has played into Altaf Hussain\u2019s politics of victimhood so cleverly exploited by him in the past. Sealing and bulldozing MQM offices without legal sanction will certainly strengthen the hard-liners in the party. The spectacle of Farooq Sattar being dragged out of the Karachi Press Club by uniformed officers and forcibly taken to the Rangers headquarters is hard to rationalise.

PPP leaders Syed Khurshid Shah and Aitzaz Ahsan on Tuesday told PTI vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi that they would respond to his party\u2019s formal invitation to participate in the Sept 3 anti-government rally in Lahore after consulting their top leadership. Hours after Mr Qureshi\u2019s meeting with the PPP leaders, PTI chairman Imran Khan announced that his party would hold a public meeting in Karachi\u2019s Nishtar Park on Sept 6 to express solidarity with the country and to condemn MQM chief Altaf Hussain\u2019s anti-Pakistan speech. \nPublic meeting in Karachi on Sept 6, says Imran\n\nSources in the PPP told Dawn that the party was reluctant to join the Sept 3 rally because of Imran Khan\u2019s habit of taking \u201cunilateral decisions\u201d. A senior PPP leader said that keeping in mind the outcome of the PTI\u2019s 2014 sit-in against alleged rigging in the general elections, the party would have to be cautious while taking a decision about joining the PTI rally. When asked if the party could nominate someone for a token participation in the Sept 3 rally, he said it also appeared to be difficult in the present circumstances because it would be seen as providing a \u201ctacit support\u201d to the PTI\u2019s unilateral call. Moreover, he added, other opposition parties such as the Awami National Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement had also distanced themselves from the PTI\u2019s plan to hold rallies on the Panama issue. He said the PPP leadership also considered the PTI\u2019s decision to file a petition in the Supreme Court as \u201cunwise\u201d. Talking to reporters after the meeting, the PPP and PTI leaders, however, claimed that there was a complete unity among the opposition parties on the Panama issue and all of them wanted an across-the-board accountability of all those who owned offshore companies as revealed by the Panama Papers. Mr Qureshi said the parliamentary committee formed by the National Assembly speaker to draft terms of reference (ToR) for the proposed judicial commission on Panamagate had \u201cmet premature death due to the government\u2019s \nstubbornness\u201d. \u201cThe ToR committee is now a dead horse,\u201d he said, adding that the MQM had already come out of the committee whereas Jamaat-i-Islami had decided to approach the apex court after getting disappointed from the committee.

Police reproduced MQM leaders MNA Kanwar Naveed Jameel, Qamar Mansoor and Shahid Pasha, who have been in custody since Aug 23, along with around 40 workers, including three women, because their last physical remand ended on Aug 30. The police sought further extension in the custody of the suspects and submitted that they had recovered sticks and iron rods, allegedly used during the crime, on the lead provided by the detained suspects and added that some eyewitnesses had identified around 25 suspects during identification parades conducted by a judicial magistrate on Aug 30. However, the defence counsel opposed the extension in physical remand and asked the court to send them to prison. The administrative judge sent the suspects to prison on 14-day judicial remand and directed the police to submit investigation reports. The suspects have been booked in two cases registered at the Artillery Madian police station under multiple allegations, including sedition and offences against the state, after the Aug 22 riots. A highly-provocative speech of their London-based chief on Aug 22 outside the Karachi Press Club allegedly triggered the violent protest, arson attacks and ransacking of media houses and left a passer-by dead. Meanwhile, MQM leader MNA Kanwar Naveed Jameel informally spoke to the media while leaving the court premises and said that he had confidence in Dr Farooq Sattar and was convinced with his policy. The bail applications of the three women activists Rabia, Sumera and Quratual Ain are fixed before an ATC on Thursday. The first case was registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempted murder), 353 (criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 123-A (condemnation of the creation of the state and advocacy of abolition of its sovereignty), 124-A (sedition), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage, etc), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), 337 (shajjah), 506-B (criminal for intimidation) and 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The second FIR was registered under Sections 123-A, 124-A, 109 and 34 of the PPC read with Section 7 of the ATA against the same set of suspects. Besides 1,500 to 2,000 unidentified men and women, the police also named around a dozen party leaders, including Altaf Hussain, Dr Farooq Sattar and Amir Khan as absconders in both cases registered at the Artillery Madian police station.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Ishaq Tanoli", "title": "Over 40 MQM activists sent to jail in media attacks cases"}}

{"1281026": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "SENATOR Mohammad Yaqoob Khan\u2019s view that the \u2018poor are born to serve the rich\u2019 (Aug 26) may sound offensive but it reflects a pervasive mindset that prevails not only in Pakistan but in countries like the USA. This is not surprising given the fact that a British imam and many sheikhs in the Arab world believe that slavery was banned by Abraham Lincoln and not by Islam. My personal view is that what Lincoln did is apparently tenable under the Islamic concept of maslaha mursala (broader public interest). A bitter truth is that inequality has remained a feature of most societies, and the countless studies by political philosophers like Aristotle, Tacitus, Moska, Michel, Marx, Pareto and C. Wright Mill attest to this. What a pity that demokratia (power of the people) never succeeds in equalising citizens.James Maddison\u2019s idea of having a bicameral legislature to balance the brute power of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie did not bear fruit. We only have to look at the performance of our National Assembly versus the Senate, Lok Sabha versus Rajya Sabha, the House of Commons versus the House of Lords, so on. Nevertheless, all democracies envisioned `opportunities for political participation to larger proportions of the population\u2019, and across-the-board accountability (no loan write-offs or plots and permits). Democracy is a progressive effort to equalise citizens before the law, rather than legalising the elite and mafias. It is unfortunate that a senator regards inequality as an unchangeable status quo.William A. Welsh says: \u201cThe rise of democracy has signalled the decline of elites\u201d (Leaders and Elites, p 1). But, a bitter lesson of history is that demokratia had always been an ideal, never a reality. History reminds us that no system, not even ochlocracy (mobocracy) could ever bulldoze governing elites. The Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals, and the English ruled through handpicked elites.The \u2018equal citizen\u2019 as enshrined in our constitution has remained a myth. Even American democracy is run by a handful of specialised people while the majority of the population is a silent spectator, a \u201cbewildered herd\u201d (Chomsky).Amjed Jaaved Rawalpindi(2)THE senator\u2019s contentious remarks have underscored the chauvinistic mindset of the privileged class towards the underdogs of Pakistani society.The biggest irony is that the same senator had been elected thrice from NA-263, but he did not establish a single hospital or educational institution in his hometown. In this backdrop it comes as no surprise that he is utterly nonchalant towards the miserable plight of the poor people living next to his home. Meanwhile, he also dilated upon the misconception prevalent in our society that God has made social and economic divisions.Quite contrary to his comments, the truth is that it is not God but people like the senator who have contributed to the creation of such disparities. To sum it up, people of such mindset can hardly alleviate the miseries of poor and downtrodden people.M.

The authors explain why efforts to build a comprehensive Afghanistan-centric regional security order have failed and make suggestions for resetting inter-state relations.Mr Harpviken said the book had been completed a year ago and that his co-author and him had wanted to research even more and warned that the book did not contain easy answers.Those who attended the launch expressed interest in regional issues and their impact on different countries and a lively discussion followed Mr Harpviken\u2019s speech.Associated Press regional correspondent Kathy Gannon, who survived being shot in Afghanistan in 2014, suggested that the issue of borders between Afghanistan, Pakistan and India be discussed in order to ensure regional stability.To this, Mr Harpviken said that solving border problems may not address all issues between countries of the region.Defence analyst Zahid Hussain said Afghanistan was also affected by many external factors including the rivalry between India and Pakistan.\u201cThe 2,500 kilometre border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is very porous and people can travel through to both sides, which is very difficult to manage,\u201d he said.The dispute over the Durand Line is also an issue between the two countries and Afghanistan is the only country which opposed the formation of Pakistan in the United Nations and refused to accept it, Mr Hussain said.The analyst said that according to some reports, the Taliban and Russia were in some sort of contact, which may increase the problems of the region.Ms Gannon spoke about competitions between militant groups in Afghanistan, which she said are trying to organise themselves and making recruitments.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "A Reporter", "title": "\u2018Afghanistan is plagued by internal problems\u2019"}}

PPP leaders Syed Khurshid Shah and Aitzaz Ahsan on Tuesday told PTI vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi that they would respond to his party\u2019s formal invitation to participate in the Sept 3 anti-government rally in Lahore after consulting their top leadership. Hours after Mr Qureshi\u2019s meeting with the PPP leaders, PTI chairman Imran Khan announced that his party would hold a public meeting in Karachi\u2019s Nishtar Park on Sept 6 to express solidarity with the country and to condemn MQM chief Altaf Hussain\u2019s anti-Pakistan speech. \nPublic meeting in Karachi on Sept 6, says Imran\n\nSources in the PPP told Dawn that the party was reluctant to join the Sept 3 rally because of Imran Khan\u2019s habit of taking \u201cunilateral decisions\u201d. A senior PPP leader said that keeping in mind the outcome of the PTI\u2019s 2014 sit-in against alleged rigging in the general elections, the party would have to be cautious while taking a decision about joining the PTI rally. When asked if the party could nominate someone for a token participation in the Sept 3 rally, he said it also appeared to be difficult in the present circumstances because it would be seen as providing a \u201ctacit support\u201d to the PTI\u2019s unilateral call. Moreover, he added, other opposition parties such as the Awami National Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement had also distanced themselves from the PTI\u2019s plan to hold rallies on the Panama issue. He said the PPP leadership also considered the PTI\u2019s decision to file a petition in the Supreme Court as \u201cunwise\u201d. Talking to reporters after the meeting, the PPP and PTI leaders, however, claimed that there was a complete unity among the opposition parties on the Panama issue and all of them wanted an across-the-board accountability of all those who owned offshore companies as revealed by the Panama Papers. Mr Qureshi said the parliamentary committee formed by the National Assembly speaker to draft terms of reference (ToR) for the proposed judicial commission on Panamagate had \u201cmet premature death due to the government\u2019s \nstubbornness\u201d. \u201cThe ToR committee is now a dead horse,\u201d he said, adding that the MQM had already come out of the committee whereas Jamaat-i-Islami had decided to approach the apex court after getting disappointed from the committee. Mr Qureshi said the PTI would completely support the bill drafted by Aitzaz Ahsan for formation of the Panama commission and it would soon be moved in the Senate as a private member\u2019s bill.

Ms Swaraj on her part ruled out any dialogue with Islamabad, saying \u201ctalks with Pakistan will happen only when it takes steps on the Pathankot terror attack\u201d since \u201cterror and talks cannot go hand-in-hand\u201d. Mr Kerry is in Delhi for the second strategic and commercial dialogue between India and the United States. \u201cI briefed Secretary Kerry on the continuing problem of cross-border terrorism that India and the larger region face from Pakistan,\u201d Ms Swaraj said, adding: \u201cWe both agreed that nations must not maintain double standards, such as the categorisation of good and bad terrorists, nor must they act as sanctuaries and safe havens for terrorist organisations.\u201d \nTalks with Pakistan only after Pathankot probe, says Swaraj\n\nShe said both sides reaffirmed the urgent necessity for Pakistan to dismantle \u201csafe havens for terrorists and criminal networks, including Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and D Company\u201d, the latter being India\u2019s reference to Mumbai underworld don Dawood Ibrahim who Delhi says is being sheltered by Pakistan. \u201cSecretary Kerry and I also agreed on the need for Pakistan to do more to bring the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai and 2016 Pathankot terrorist attacks to justice quickly,\u201d she said. Mr Kerry agreed. \u201cWe cannot and will not distinguish between good and bad terrorists\u2026 US stands with India on all matters of terrorism, no matter where it comes from. It\u2019s crystal clear we are on the same view over it.\u201d Ms Swaraj said they spoke on the need to strengthen the international legal regime to counter terrorism. \u201cWe agreed on additional measures to strengthen our counterterrorism cooperation, specifically, to work for early operationalisation of the agreement on exchange of information on known or suspected terrorists. We will also intensify intelligence sharing and continue to work closely to get terrorist entities listed by the UN system, by coordinating our approach to the UN 1267 Committee.\u201d Mr Kerry said the United States had been speaking to all the countries in the region about the issue, and appreciated Pakistan\u2019s role in eliminating the threat. He confirmed that progress was made on an agreement about the construction of six nuclear reactors by US giant Westinghouse. \u201cWe hope to see our civil nuclear cooperation take shape in the form of new reactors that will deliver reliable electricity to tens of millions of Indian households.\u201d The deal has been held up in the past by concerns over India\u2019s laws that would make US companies liable for accidents at plants they helped build. Ms Swaraj said she had thanked Mr Kerry for American support for India\u2019s bid to join the elite Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a bloc of 48 countries. Earlier this year, the US led an initiative for India to gain admission to the bloc that trades in sophisticated nuclear material and technology, but China and a group of countries blocked India\u2019s membership bid. Washington has promised to push India\u2019s bid at \u201cthe highest levels\u201d before the next NSG meeting later this year. The United States on Tuesday agreed to \u201clook into\u201d India\u2019s concerns over the Obama administration\u2019s move to hike fees for H1B and L1 visas. India Inc. raised the issue at the India-US CEO Forum, saying the move hurt Indian IT firms which are the main users of these non-immigrant temporary work visas. Ms Swaraj and Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said India had conveyed its concerns to the US side during a bilateral strategic and commercial dialogue. The visa fee hike has \u201caffected our people-to-people exchanges\u2026 I would urge you to find a just and non-discriminatory solution to these issues,\u201d Ms Swaraj told Mr Kerry. Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter sealed an agreement on Monday in Washington in efforts to strengthen defence ties to counter concerns over China\u2019s growing military assertiveness, reports said. Both countries can now access each other\u2019s military bases. Mr Parrikar has stressed that the new agreement does not allow for US bases to be set up on Indian soil, nor for troops to be stationed there.

{"1281186": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "SEOUL: Despite the improving Chinese Super League and their growing number of famous foreign stars, it is a second appearance at the World Cup by their homegrown players that fans in China truly crave. And if their national team can beat 2002 semi-finalists South Korea in Seoul on Thursday night, the chances of a trip to Russia in 2018 may improve considerably. The Chinese Super League\u2019s highest-profile stars \u2014 such as Alex Teixeira, Hulk and Jackson Martinez \u2014 will be of no help when China makes the short journey to the South Korean capital for the opening game in the last round of Asian qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. For China, who made their only World Cup appearance in 2002, the precedents are troubling. They have defeated South Korea just once in 30 meetings. Not only is history against the visitors, but recent form is too. South Korea, who have appeared at the past eight World Cups, breezed through the second round of qualification, winning all seven games, scoring 24 goals and conceding none. China, appearing in the final round of qualification for the first time since 2002, squeezed through as the fourth of the best four group runners-up.\u201cWe know it will be a difficult game but we are ready for the challenge,\u201d said China coach Gao Hongbo, who was in charge in 2010 when China recorded their famous victory over South Korea at the East Asian Cup. \u201cMy goal as head coach is to qualify for Russia 2018. We are not here just as a training partner for our opponents. The mentality of chasing the win is essential for every coach and player.\u201d China have included just one overseas-based player in their 25-man squad for the game in Seoul and the home match against Iran in the northeastern city of Shenyang five days later. South Korea, in contrast, have just three domestic stars in their roster. There has been speculation that South Korea\u2019s most famous export, Tottenham Hotspur attacker Son Heung-min, is being chased by Bundesliga clubs. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything about my transfer,\u201d Son, who joined the English Premier League team in August 2015 from Bayer Leverkusen, told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about things happening outside the stadium. I just want to focus on playing football.\u201d The 12 remaining Asian teams have been split into two groups of six, with the top two from each qualifying automatically for Russia 2018. Elsewhere in Group \u2018A\u2019, Syria travel to Uzbekistan and Iran, aiming for a fifth World Cup appearance, host Qatar in Tehran. Qatar are eager to qualify and give their team World Cup exposure before the country hosts the 2022 event. Qatar were one of the more impressive performers in the second round of qualification, topping their group with ease. In Group \u2018B\u2019, Asian champion Australia kick off their qualification campaign against Iraq in Perth and then play United Arab Emirates in Abu Dhabi on September 6. Tim Cahill has been selected by coach Ange Postecoglou, keeping the 36-year-old former English Premier League star in contention for a fourth World Cup appearance. \u201cHe\u2019s still a very important part of what we do and we know that even if he\u2019s not capable of playing 90 minutes, he can certainly make an impact for us,\u201d Postecoglou said of Cahill. Japan, expected to challenge Australia for the top spot in Group \u2018B\u2019, host United Arab Emirates in Saitama.

The movie\u2019s social media accounts has effectively displayed how massive and intimidating Kong will look. Also, as the skull (in pictures) indicates, Kong won\u2019t be the only huge creature living on Skull Island. One thing that will distinguish this Kong from the others is that he\u2019s the biggest of all the gorillas, measuring approximately 100-feet tall. Set in the 1970s, Kong: Skull Island will follow a group of explorers traversing through a previously-uncharted island in the Pacific Ocean. Unfortunately, they don\u2019t know that they\u2019ve entered Kong\u2019s domain, and just like the previous King Kong movies. The main cast includes Tom Hiddleston, Brie Larson, Samuel L. Jackson, Corey Hawkins, Tobey Kebbell, John Goodman, Jason Mitchell and plenty more. Kong: Skull Island is set to be released on March 10, 2017. \n\n\n\n\nIs Man of Steel 2 really in the works?AMan of Steel sequel is going into active development at Warner Bros., a source close to the production has informed. It is further reported that a solo Superman movie is a \u2018top priority\u2019 for Warner, and that restoring the character\u2019s reputation is of \u2018tantamount importance\u2019 to the DCEU (DC Extended Universe), as a whole.Giving Superman a solo sequel makes all the sense in the world. All of the individual Justice League members are receiving standalone movies, from The Flash and Aquaman to Wonder Woman. But it is not clear when this movie will actually happen as Warner Bros. and DC have a full slate of movies on its release calendar already, and making room for Man of Steel 2 won\u2019t be so easy. They still want to date Ben Affleck\u2019s solo Batman movie, and they have plans for movies as far out as 2019 and 2020. Right now, there are untitled DC superhero movies down for October 5, 2018 and November 1, 2019. Could one of those hold Man of Steel 2? Fingers crossed!

Police reproduced MQM leaders MNA Kanwar Naveed Jameel, Qamar Mansoor and Shahid Pasha, who have been in custody since Aug 23, along with around 40 workers, including three women, because their last physical remand ended on Aug 30. The police sought further extension in the custody of the suspects and submitted that they had recovered sticks and iron rods, allegedly used during the crime, on the lead provided by the detained suspects and added that some eyewitnesses had identified around 25 suspects during identification parades conducted by a judicial magistrate on Aug 30. However, the defence counsel opposed the extension in physical remand and asked the court to send them to prison. The administrative judge sent the suspects to prison on 14-day judicial remand and directed the police to submit investigation reports. The suspects have been booked in two cases registered at the Artillery Madian police station under multiple allegations, including sedition and offences against the state, after the Aug 22 riots. A highly-provocative speech of their London-based chief on Aug 22 outside the Karachi Press Club allegedly triggered the violent protest, arson attacks and ransacking of media houses and left a passer-by dead. Meanwhile, MQM leader MNA Kanwar Naveed Jameel informally spoke to the media while leaving the court premises and said that he had confidence in Dr Farooq Sattar and was convinced with his policy. The bail applications of the three women activists Rabia, Sumera and Quratual Ain are fixed before an ATC on Thursday. The first case was registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempted murder), 353 (criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 123-A (condemnation of the creation of the state and advocacy of abolition of its sovereignty), 124-A (sedition), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage, etc), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), 337 (shajjah), 506-B (criminal for intimidation) and 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The second FIR was registered under Sections 123-A, 124-A, 109 and 34 of the PPC read with Section 7 of the ATA against the same set of suspects.

The Chinese Super League\u2019s highest-profile stars \u2014 such as Alex Teixeira, Hulk and Jackson Martinez \u2014 will be of no help when China makes the short journey to the South Korean capital for the opening game in the last round of Asian qualifying for the 2018 World Cup. For China, who made their only World Cup appearance in 2002, the precedents are troubling. They have defeated South Korea just once in 30 meetings. Not only is history against the visitors, but recent form is too. South Korea, who have appeared at the past eight World Cups, breezed through the second round of qualification, winning all seven games, scoring 24 goals and conceding none. China, appearing in the final round of qualification for the first time since 2002, squeezed through as the fourth of the best four group runners-up.\u201cWe know it will be a difficult game but we are ready for the challenge,\u201d said China coach Gao Hongbo, who was in charge in 2010 when China recorded their famous victory over South Korea at the East Asian Cup. \u201cMy goal as head coach is to qualify for Russia 2018. We are not here just as a training partner for our opponents. The mentality of chasing the win is essential for every coach and player.\u201d China have included just one overseas-based player in their 25-man squad for the game in Seoul and the home match against Iran in the northeastern city of Shenyang five days later. South Korea, in contrast, have just three domestic stars in their roster. There has been speculation that South Korea\u2019s most famous export, Tottenham Hotspur attacker Son Heung-min, is being chased by Bundesliga clubs. \u201cI haven\u2019t heard anything about my transfer,\u201d Son, who joined the English Premier League team in August 2015 from Bayer Leverkusen, told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think about things happening outside the stadium.

Fallujah has fallen in the west and Iraqi forces have captured key approaches to Mosul, the ancient Tigris city whose fall in 2014 signalled the group\u2019s lightning rise.Meanwhile, advances by a US-backed coalition in Syria have all but cut IS off from the Turkish border, after the loss of the key town of Manbij, and started to press into its Euphrates valley heartland.Few people expect further advances against IS to be rapid or straightforward, but the group\u2019s enemies have built a clear momentum in both Iraq and Syria that has pushed it to adopt a strategy of attacks overseas.Adnani was the man behind that policy, demonstrating an ideological and tactical flexibility that allowed the group first to capitalise on its seizure of land, and then to adapt as it was forced to retreat.In doing so, IS has made a switch in emphasis from its dreams of unifying all Muslims under a single, militant caliphate, to an older jihadist strategy of striking terror into its enemies by attacking them in their own countries.But it has done this partly by harnessing shock tactics and social media to inspire and guide attacks by radicalised amateurs, rather than rely solely upon the highly trained but cumbersome militant cells of an earlier era. This, in part, was Adnani\u2019s legacy.Apocalyptic prophecy The IS said on Tuesday Adnani was killed \u201cwhile surveying the operations to repel the military campaigns against Aleppo. His presence in the Aleppo countryside may reflect its strategic and symbolic importance to IS. The northwest has become both the most active theatre of Syria\u2019s war and an arena for competing regional and global powers.The government and mainstream rebel groups, which between them hold most of Syria\u2019s western, most populous, regions, have focused on their battle for control of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s biggest city before the war, and a strategic prize.But to the north and east, a secondary conflict has played out as US-backed Kurdish fighters and Turkey-backed rebels, who are also fighting each other, have squeezed IS\u2019s once expansive tracts along the Turkish border and Euphrates basin.These advances have all but cut off IS from its last foothold on the Turkish border, its link to new foreign recruits, while a steady push from the north has brought its enemies to within 30km of its Syrian capital Raqqa.But these strategic setbacks are not IS\u2019s only interest in the Aleppo countryside: just 30km northwest of al-Bab is the village of Dabiq.A few streets surrounded by fields, it will be the site, says Islamic prophecy, of a final battle between Muslims and infidels that will herald the apocalypse.So importa{"1281136": {"date": "Updated Sep 01, 2016 11:05pm", "article": "Mohammad Amir runs in for the fourth time in the innings and bowls a fuller delivery, searching for his trademark late swing.\n\n\n\nConsidering the left-armer\u2019s failure to extract lateral movement throughout the tour, one is heartened to see him target full-length.

Tim Cahill has been selected by coach Ange Postecoglou, keeping the 36-year-old former English Premier League star in contention for a fourth World Cup appearance. \u201cHe\u2019s still a very important part of what we do and we know that even if he\u2019s not capable of playing 90 minutes, he can certainly make an impact for us,\u201d Postecoglou said of Cahill. Japan, expected to challenge Australia for the top spot in Group \u2018B\u2019, host United Arab Emirates in Saitama. The UAE knocked Japan out of the 2015 Asian Cup on their way to finishing in third place. There are 13 European-based players in Japan\u2019s squad, while the UAE\u2019s roster is entirely home-based. Despite that, playmaker Omar Abdulrahman, regarded as one of the biggest talents in Asian football, is confident that his team can return home with a good result. \u201cWe respect the Japanese team completely,\u201d Abdulrahman said. \u201cWe came here to show a good level, and take a positive return, and already have defeated the Japanese national team at the Asian Cup. Now we will try to repeat it.\u201d Saudi Arabia, coached by Bert Van Marwijk who led the Netherlands to the final of the 2010 World Cup, will host Thailand in the other Group \u2018B\u2019 match. The Saudis have qualified for four World Cups but the last appearance came in 2006.

{"1281196": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "BEIRUT: The US air strike believed to have killed Abu Mohammad al-Adnani has deprived the militant Islamic State group of the architect of its attacks on the West, as it faces the loss of swathes of its heartlands.One of the last survivors of the Al Qaeda militants who originally formed IS last decade in Iraq, including its self-appointed caliph Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, Adnani had risen to become one of its most influential leaders.\u201cIt\u2019s a major morale and propaganda blow to the group because it shows that their top leadership is being targeted by an effective and organised chain,\u201d Brigadier Yahya Rasool, spokesman for the joint operations command of Iraq\u2019s army, told Reuters in Baghdad.Not only did Adnani orchestrate IS\u2019s propaganda effort, an undertaking at the heart of its quest to lay waste modern nation states, but he also served as one of its principle military planners.Those skills will be hard to replace, even in a group as resilient as IS, after a series of territorial losses and killings of top leaders.In recent months IS\u2019s losses in Iraq have mounted. Fallujah has fallen in the west and Iraqi forces have captured key approaches to Mosul, the ancient Tigris city whose fall in 2014 signalled the group\u2019s lightning rise.Meanwhile, advances by a US-backed coalition in Syria have all but cut IS off from the Turkish border, after the loss of the key town of Manbij, and started to press into its Euphrates valley heartland.Few people expect further advances against IS to be rapid or straightforward, but the group\u2019s enemies have built a clear momentum in both Iraq and Syria that has pushed it to adopt a strategy of attacks overseas.Adnani was the man behind that policy, demonstrating an ideological and tactical flexibility that allowed the group first to capitalise on its seizure of land, and then to adapt as it was forced to retreat.In doing so, IS has made a switch in emphasis from its dreams of unifying all Muslims under a single, militant caliphate, to an older jihadist strategy of striking terror into its enemies by attacking them in their own countries.But it has done this partly by harnessing shock tactics and social media to inspire and guide attacks by radicalised amateurs, rather than rely solely upon the highly trained but cumbersome militant cells of an earlier era. This, in part, was Adnani\u2019s legacy.Apocalyptic prophecy The IS said on Tuesday Adnani was killed \u201cwhile surveying the operations to repel the military campaigns against Aleppo. His presence in the Aleppo countryside may reflect its strategic and symbolic importance to IS. The northwest has become both the most active theatre of Syria\u2019s war and an arena for competing regional and global powers.The government and mainstream rebel groups, which between them hold most of Syria\u2019s western, most populous, regions, have focused on their battle for control of Aleppo, Syria\u2019s biggest city before the war, and a strategic prize.But to the north and east, a secondary conflict has played out as US-backed Kurdish fighters and Turkey-backed rebels, who are also fighting each other, have squeezed IS\u2019s once expansive tracts along the Turkish border and Euphrates basin.These advances have all but cut off IS from its last foothold on the Turkish border, its link to new foreign recruits, while a steady push from the north has brought its enemies to within 30km of its Syrian capital Raqqa.But these strategic setbacks are not IS\u2019s only interest in the Aleppo countryside: just 30km northwest of al-Bab is the village of Dabiq.A few streets surrounded by fields, it will be the site, says Islamic prophecy, of a final battle between Muslims and infidels that will herald the apocalypse.So important is this event in IS propaganda, of which Adnani was the chief, that Dabiq was the name chosen for its online magazine that sought to inspire new recruits to its militant cause and instruct them in the ways of global jihad.Hammered Hammered by two years of US-led coalition air strikes and military losses on the ground, Adnani increasingly called in audio messages for attacks against the United States and Western countries. His group said it was behind deadly attacks in Paris, Nice and Brussels.The shift was partly born of tactical necessity after Western and regional governments made it harder for would-be militants to travel to Syria or Iraq to join the group.\u201cIf the tyrants close the door of migration in your faces, then open the door of jihad in theirs and turn their actions against them,\u201d he said in an audio clip.Born in 1977 as Taha Subhi Falaha in Syria\u2019s Idlib Province southwest of Aleppo, he pledged allegiance to IS\u2019s predecessor, Al Qaeda, more than a decade ago and was once imprisoned by US forces in Iraq.He left Syria to travel to Iraq to fight US forces there after its 2003 invasion, and only returned to his homeland after the start of its own civil war in 2011, a person who knew his family said. A biography posted on militant websites says he grew up with a \u201clove of mosques\u201d and was a prolific reader.A US counterterrorism official who monitors IS said Adnani\u2019s death would hurt the militants \u201cin the area that increasingly concerns us as the group loses more and more of its caliphate and its financial base ... and turns to mounting and inspiring more attacks in Europe, Southeast Asia and elsewhere\u201d.Hisham al-Hashimi, a Baghdad-based security analyst that advises the Iraqi government on IS affairs, said: \u201cAs a military target, Adnani is less important than [ex war minister Omar] al-Shishani...(killed earlier this year in Iraq). His death is mainly a blow to their morale, he is the one who inspires the fighters to join in Syria.\u201d-ReutersPublished in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Angus McDowall | Samia Nakhoul", "title": "Death of IS tactician comes at critical moment"}}

Police reproduced MQM leaders MNA Kanwar Naveed Jameel, Qamar Mansoor and Shahid Pasha, who have been in custody since Aug 23, along with around 40 workers, including three women, because their last physical remand ended on Aug 30. The police sought further extension in the custody of the suspects and submitted that they had recovered sticks and iron rods, allegedly used during the crime, on the lead provided by the detained suspects and added that some eyewitnesses had identified around 25 suspects during identification parades conducted by a judicial magistrate on Aug 30. However, the defence counsel opposed the extension in physical remand and asked the court to send them to prison. The administrative judge sent the suspects to prison on 14-day judicial remand and directed the police to submit investigation reports. The suspects have been booked in two cases registered at the Artillery Madian police station under multiple allegations, including sedition and offences against the state, after the Aug 22 riots. A highly-provocative speech of their London-based chief on Aug 22 outside the Karachi Press Club allegedly triggered the violent protest, arson attacks and ransacking of media houses and left a passer-by dead.

The vote, passing the needed two-thirds majority, meant she was immediately removed from office.However, in a surprise twist, a separate vote to bar Rousseff from holding any public office for eight years failed to pass, meaning she could in theory re-enter political life.In a statement from the Alvorada presidential palace on the outskirts of the capital Brasilia, Rousseff, from the leftist Workers' Party, called her forced exit a \u201ccoup.\u201d\u201cThey decided to interrupt the mandate of a president who had committed no crime. They have convicted an innocent person and carried out a parliamentary coup,\u201d she said.Cheers -- and cries of disappointment -- erupted in the blue-carpeted, circular Senate chamber as the impeachment verdict flashed up on the electronic voting screen.Pro-impeachment senators burst into a rendering of the national anthem, some waving Brazilian flags, while leftist allies of Rousseff, who back her claims of being victim of a right-wing coup, stood stony-faced.\u201cI will not associate my name with this infamy,\u201d read a sign held up by one senator.Renan Calheiros, the Senate president, rejected Rousseff's coup claim, saying her impeachment might not have been perfect, but had \u201cthe DNA of democracy, the DNA of the constitution.\u201d Rousseff's vice president turned bitter political enemy, Michel Temer, was to be sworn in as her replacement at 1900 GMT, Calheiros announced.Temer, a veteran center-right politician, was then to leave for a G20 summit in China.Anti-Rousseff anger\nRousseff, Brazil's first woman president, stood accused of taking illegal state loans to patch budget holes in 2014, masking the country's problems as it slid into its deepest recession in decades.She told the Senate during a marathon 14-hour session on Monday that she is innocent and that abuse of the impeachment process put Brazil's democracy, restored in 1985 after a two-decades-long military dictatorship, at risk.Recalling how she was tortured and imprisoned in the 1970s for belonging to a leftist guerrilla group, \nRousseff urged senators to \u201cvote against impeachment, vote for democracy... Do not accept a coup.\u201d However, huge anti-Rousseff street demonstrations over the last year have reflected nationwide anger at her management of a country suffering double-digit unemployment and inflation.The once mighty Workers' Party, meanwhile, has struggled to stage more than small rallies.Temer, who was in an uncomfortable partnership with Rousseff before finally splitting, will be president until the next scheduled elections in late 2018.The 75-year-old, known more as a backroom wheeler-dealer than street politician, took over in an interim role after Rousseff's initial suspension in May.He immediately named a new government with an agenda of shifting Brazil to the right after more than a decade of leftist rule that saw 29 million people lifted from poverty, but became bogged down in corruption and the economic slump.Temer has earned plaudits from investors. It remains uncertain whether he will have voters' support to push through the painful austerity reforms he promises.Emotions spill over\nAbout 50 leftist demonstrators gathered outside the presidential palace to show their support for Rousseff.\u201cWe are protesting against the coup and fighting for democracy,\u201d said 61-year-old farmer Orlando Ribeiro.In the center of the capital, extra security and the closing of avenues near the Senate caused massive traffic jams. Police said they were preparing for large protests later in the day.On the Senate floor, emotions crackled in the run-up to the vote, then overflowed as senators made final speeches on what both sides of the debate agreed was history in the making.Senator Aecio Neves, Rousseff's narrowly defeated center-right opponent in her 2014 re-election, pronounced triumphantly: \u201cThe constitution won. Brazil won!\u201d But Senator Vanessa Grazziotin was scathing in her summing up of an \u201cillegal process that is called impeachment but is a coup.\u201d \u201cTemer does not have legitimacy to govern this country,\u201d she warned.\u201cThis is a farce, a farce, a farce,\u201d shouted another pro-Rousseff senator, Lindbergh Farias.Shaking his fists at the majority backing impeachment, he cried: \u201cThey're going in the garbage can of history. \u201c\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Brazil's Senate strips Rousseff of presidency"}}

He said the proposed law made it binding upon all those whose names had appeared in the Panama Papers to provide judges of the commission access to their bank accounts.PPP spokesperson Farhatullah Babar told Dawn the government had shared its proposed amendments to the Commission of Inquiry Act, 1956 with the opposition, which was unanimously rejected by the opposition, since it unnecessarily broadened the scope of inquiries, defeating the very purpose of the law.Though the government had given more powers to the commission, it had broadened its scope far too much, making it almost impossible for it to complete its investigations, he said.However, Mr Babar said he did not know whether the draft approved by the cabinet was the same that was shared with them, adding that the government\u2019s secrecy around the draft raised suspicion.However, talking to Dawn, Finance Minister Ishaq Dar claimed the government was bringing a \u201ccompletely new law\u201d, after which the old one would stand repealed.He also admitted that the approved draft was not the same as the one shared with the opposition.\u201cIt\u2019s not the same draft we gave to the ToR Committee the last time, it\u2019s a further improved version,\u201d the minister said.Briefing reporters on the decision reached in the cabinet meeting, Mr Dar said that through the new law, the government had \u201cempowered the commission\u201d \u2014 an apparent reference to criticism of the old law by Chief Justice \nAnwar Zaheer Jamali, who had observed that any commission formed under the 1956 law would be \u201ctoothless\u201d.The existing law, Mr Dar said, had been around for 60 years and several inquiries had been conducted under: from the separation of East Pakistan in 1971 to the killing of Osama bin Laden in Abbottabad in 2012.That the opposition has chosen to submit its bill to the Senate comes as no surprise, since they command a majority in the upper house. The government, meanwhile, is confident of its majority in the lower house, and can also bulldoze legislation through a joint sitting, if need be.In June, after a series of meetings of the parliamentary committee on the Panama Papers issue, opposition parties had decided not to hold further talks with the ruling coalition after the government\u2019s refusal to accept their ToR for a Panama-specific probe.The opposition alliance not only rejected the government-prepared ToR, but presented its own version, demanding that the judicial commission begin the inquiry with the prime minister and his family.However, both sides had agreed that besides concentrating on the individuals named in the Panama Papers, the committee will also go after those who received kickbacks and commissions, as well as those who had their loans written off illegally.Salient features\nAlthough the government bill was not released to the media, the opposition bill seen by Dawn includes all their proposed terms of reference (ToR), which the government has already rejected, as provisions of the law.In the draft bill, the commission has been given all the powers of a court under the Constitution, the Pakistan Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure and the Supreme Court Rules.The bill binds the commission to first investigate Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and his family members before proceeding against the other Pakistanis named in the Panama Papers.However, the text avoids naming PM Sharif or his office, instead referring to: \u201crespondents, including their family members, who have publicly volunteered for accountability or have publicly admitted holding of assets and properties or off-shore companies abroad\u201d.The commission is bound to complete the inquiry against the prime minister in three months \u2013 with the option for a one month extension \u2013 while it will get 12 months to proceed against all others whose names had appeared in the Panama Papers.According to the proposed law, the federal government will be required \u201cto make a reference to the chief justice of Pakistan to nominate three judges of the Supreme Court to be constituted as a commission to inquire into the revelations made by the Panama Papers.\u201dThe commission shall be bound to submit a final report for each case to the federal government, which will be published by the federal government within one week of its submission.\u201cThe federal and provincial governments and all governmental agencies and executive authorities, including the National Accountability Bureau, Federal Investigation Agency, Intelligence Bureau, Federal Board of Revenue, State Bank of Pakistan and Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan shall act in aid of the Commission and extend all cooperation and assistance necessary to the Commission and shall comply with all its directions.\u201dPublished in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Amir Wasim", "title": "Govt, opposition to table bills for Panama probe"}}

An induction ceremony was held at PNS Mehran on Wednesday. Chief of Naval Staff Admiral Mohammad Zakaullah was the chief guest. He said that the Pakistan Navy Air Arm had come a long way since its inception in the early 1970s. The induction of ATR aircraft is part of the PN Aviation Vision 2030. He said that complex and fluid maritime environment in the region required the navy to shoulder more challenging tasks related to maritime security, besides maintaining combat readiness against traditional threats. In this regard aviation is an indispensable component of the fleet for all envisaged tasks. ATR aircraft are modern and widely operated turboprop platforms equipped with state-of-the-art Traffic Collision Avoidance System, auto pilot and high-efficiency six-bladed propellers. The average ground speed of the aircraft is 250 knots with an endurance of about six hours. The addition of ATR aircraft to the PN aviation fleet is a giant leap forward in accelerating the capabilities of the Naval Air Arm, which will provide a low-cost solution to maritime operations. The naval chief said that the induction of the Scan Eagle Unmanned Aerial System into the naval fleet was yet another major transformation in terms of acquisition of new capabilities. It will start a new era in the PN\u2019s operational capability by enhancing its intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities.

{"1281386": {"date": "Updated September 04, 2016", "article": "The US administration had kept a vigilant eye on political developments in Pakistan for quite some time but the country\u2019s attempts to acquire nuclear capability were on the top of the US agenda. Meanwhile, Benazir Bhutto, the country\u2019s first democratically elected prime minister since the death of dictator Gen Zia prepared for her scheduled visit to the US in June 1989.Pakistan\u2019s immediate need was financial assistance to meet its budgetary deficit. Although US aid was coming in to support Pakistan\u2019s anti-Soviet occupation policy in Afghanistan, the country confronted the huge challenge of supporting more than four million Afghan refugees as a result of war. The US feared, however, that a part of the funds provided for refugees and other allied issues was being used instead for the development of a nuclear bomb. Consequently with the aim of capping Pakistan\u2019s nuclear programme, US aid had become conditional for the continuation of military and economic aid. For the continuation of military and economic aid, the Pressler amendment, passed in 1985 required the American president to issue annual certification that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear explosive device. Despite being prime minister, Bhutto had been kept isolated from the nuclear programme. Although no reasons were given for it, it seemed that civilian involvement was not welcome in the secretive programme by the military. She decided to meet Dr Munir Ahmad, chairman of the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission to discuss Pakistan\u2019s nuclear capability. It was during this meeting that Benazir Bhutto was introduced to Dr Abdul Qadeer Khan who had been put in charge of developing the bomb by her father Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto. The prime minister asked Dr Munir Ahmad to move the Ministry of Science and Technology closer to her office and to report to her on a daily basis. She also made funds available for several national security and defence projects. This infuriated President Ghulam Ishaq Khan who saw national security as his domain. As she continued with her projects and planning, Bhutto maintained her public stance saying: \u201cWe only want nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\u201d Despite US and other Western powers trying to stop Pakistan from becoming a nuclear power, it is believed that Pakistan acquired nuclear capability in 1987. \nAs US worries about Pakistan\u2019s covert nuclear programme mounted, in the 1980s, Pakistan\u2019s leadership played a game of denial and bluster\n\nOn January 11, 1989, a US delegation led by Congressman Stephen Solarz visited Pakistan and called on President Ghulam Ishaq Khan who tried to convince him that Pakistan was not making a bomb. He also asked the US not to discriminate about nuclear technology in South Asia, since India had become an avowed nuclear power back in 1974. By the end of March 1989, two months ahead of her visit to the US, Bhutto became aware that Pakistan had achieved nuclear capability to a great extent. To prevent a possible US embargo, she made sure that documents were prepared showing that the nuclear programme had been capped, although enrichment continued unabated. On arrival in the US on June 4, 1989, Benazir Bhutto received a warm welcome and was appreciated for adhering to democracy and objectively dealing with issues that confronted her. With this visit, she also became the first Pakistani prime minister to have been invited to address a joint session of the US Congress. While she held discussions with US President George Bush and other high ranking officials of the US administration, a spell of conflicting reports about Pakistan\u2019s nuclear programme appeared in the media. Some sources expressed reservations about Benazir\u2019s stance and, subsequently, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) also expressed its inability to confirm if Pakistan had really capped its nuclear programme. According to the CIA, \u201cPakistan has taken the final step toward possession of a nuclear weapon by machining uranium metal into bomb cores.\u201d For an accurate verification, the US government asked Robert Gates, Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Adviser at the White House to report on Pakistan\u2019s nuclear capability. He reported that Pakistan was not making a bomb but warned that, unless Pakistan melted down the bomb cores it had produced, President Bush would not be able to issue the Pressler amendment certification needed to permit the continued flow of military and economic aid. Twenty-four years later in 2013, Pakistan\u2019s former ambassador to the United States Hussain Haqqani wrote in his book Magnificent Delusions, \u201cWhen the Pakistanis denied that they had \u2018crossed the line\u2019, Gates commented, \u2018if it waddles like a duck, if it quacks like a duck, then maybe it is a duck\u2019.\u201d Haqqani wrote that, \u201cPakistanis had lied to Gates on both the issues that he had raised in Islamabad.\u201d The US administration had been very watchful of Pakistan\u2019s developments in politics and had refused certification to Pakistan before the December 1988 elections. Haqqani further wrote, \u201cThe US had failed to recognise that no Pakistani government could curtail the nuclear programme. After having acquired the bomb, expecting Pakistan to give it up was unrealistic; instead, this was the time for the US to accept Pakistan\u2019s nuclear status as fait accompli. If nuclear weapons were Pakistan\u2019s ultimate guarantee against its psychological fears against India, the purpose had been achieved. Rather than limiting itself to implementing the Pressler sanctions while Pakistan persisted with denial and bluster, the US could have asked Pakistan to be honest about the nukes and then negotiated safeguards against further proliferation.\u201dAfter prolonged meetings with US officials and politicians, Benazir Bhutto managed to convince President Bush to issue certification saying that Pakistan did not possess a nuclear bomb. But after her government\u2019s dismissal in November 1990 by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan, he denied the annual certification and applied an embargo through the Pressler Amendment which had a deadly impact on Pakistan\u2019s economy.shaikhaziz38@gmail.comPublished in Dawn, Sunday Magazine, September 4th, 2016\n", "author": "Shaikh Aziz", "title": "A Leaf From History: Pakistan\u2019s nuclear cat on a hot tin roof"}}

Police produced Mohammed Waheed, Adil, Fareed Ahmed, Hasnain Alam, Masroor Ahmed, Rashid, Mohsin Siddiqui, Asif Khan, Niaz Ahmed and Jawaid Shaukat in court. The newly-appointed investigating officer, SP Adil Chandio, sought their custody for questioning, identification parades of suspects and arrest of their absconding accomplices. The administrative judge handed them over to the police on one-day physical remand. It may be recalled that on Aug 29, the director general of Rangers, Sindh, said that paramilitary force had arrested six suspects and an initial probe proved that the August 22 violence was an organised and planned action, undertaken by party workers, who were already tasked with the job, adding that two bank officers belonging to the party\u2019s labour division had facilitated them. Later, the detained suspects were handed over to the police. They have been booked in two cases registered at the Artillery Madian police station under multiple allegations, including sedition and offences against the state, after the Aug 22 riots. A highly-provocative speech of the London-based MQM chief on Aug 22 outside the Karachi Press Club triggered the violent protest, arson attacks and ransacking of media houses and left a passer-by dead. The same court had already sent three party leaders MNA Kanwar Naveed Jameel, Qamar Mansoor and Shahid Pasha with around 40 workers, including three women, to prison in these cases. Meanwhile, Kanwar Jameel and Shahid Pasha through their counsel moved applications seeking better facilities in prison while the lawyer for the detained MNA also filed another application asking the court to discharge him since he was not present during the anti-state speech. The administrative judge sent the applications to the ATC-VIII for hearing. Meanwhile, an ATC adjourned on Thursday the hearing on bail applications of three women workers till Sept 3 since the investigating officer Inspector Hameed Khan informed the court that he was replaced by an SP as the IO. Man sentenced to death A sessions court sentenced on Thursday an elderly man to 10 years in prison in a murder case. The court found Abdul Waheed involved in the killing of property dealer Nawab Zaheer in September 2011 within the remit of the Brigade police station. The district and sessions judge (east) also imposed a fine of Rs100,000 and in case of non-payment, the convict would undergo an additional six-month imprisonment. A prosecutor said that the court awarded lesser punishment to the convict by taking a lenient view due to the age factor as he was said to be around 70 years old. According to the prosecution, the accused and the victim were neighbours and Waheed along with his three absconding sons gunned down Zaheer over a petty dispute.

Protesters gather in front of the Mexican consulate in Los Angeles to protest Trump\u2019s visit to Mexico.\u2014Agencies\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPHOENIX: Donald Trump\u2019s latest deportation priorities could target more than six million individuals for immediate removal, according to a Washington Post analysis. If elected president, he said on Wednesday that his administration would also seek to bolster staffers devoted to immigration enforcement.After weeks of opaque public statements regarding his stance on mass deportations, Trump spelled out hard-line immigration priorities in a fiery speech here in Phoenix. He not only called for removing all undocumented immigrants who had committed crimes, but also said he would prioritise those who have overstayed their visas for deportation.The Republican presidential nominee also said he would triple the number of immigration and customs enforcement agents and create a \u201cnew special deportation task force\u201d to track the most serious security threats.Together, those proposals represented his most specific comments on deportation policy \u2014 and they pointed to a massive undertaking.\u201cThe police and law enforcement \u2014 they know who these people are. They live with these people. They get mocked by these people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey can\u2019t do anything about these people, and they want to. They know who these people are. Day one, my first hour in office, those people are gone.\u201dAn estimated 690,000 undocumented immigrants have committed significant crimes that would make them security priorities \u2014 felonies or serious misdemeanours \u2014 according to a study by the Migration Policy Institute. That number is closer to two million according to some, including Jessica Vaughan of the Center for Immigration Studies, whom the Trump campaign has consulted on the issue.If visa overstays are also included in the immediate priorities, as Trump said he would order during his speech, the number would grow by about 4.5 million individuals according to estimates that place overstays at about 40 per cent of total undocumented population.In all, the number of individuals prioritised for removal by ICE agents would range between about 5 million and 6.5 million, according to available data and estimates.\u201cAnd you can call it deported if you want. The press doesn\u2019t like that term. You can call it whatever the hell you want. They\u2019re gone,\u201d Trump said.The highly anticipated speech came after Trump struggled to explain how to handle the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently living in the country, at times appearing as though he would soften his position on mass deportations and potentially even offering undocumented immigrants a pathway to legal status. He had previously called for the immediate removal of all such individuals and pledged to create a \u201cdeportation force\u201d to oversee the task.But as he and his campaign have sought to expand his appeal for the general election, he has found himself caught between appeasing his earlier supporters with more tough immigration rhetoric and softening that position to appeal to moderates.His speech on Wednesday was unequivocal: \u201cWe will break the cycle of amnesty and illegal immigration. We will break the cycle. There will be no amnesty,\u201d he said. \u201cOur message to the world will be this. You cannot obtain legal status or become a citizen of the United States by illegally entering our country.

Moreover, the gap looked bigger as remittances in June were much higher because of Eidul Fitr, he said.And although year-on-year growth in remittances slowed down to 6.4pc in the preceding fiscal year, Pakistan still received around $20bn, he said.On reports that thousands of Pakistanis have lost their jobs in Saudi Arabia and awaiting dues, he said the Saudi government has assured their payments would be cleared.He stressed that macroeconomic indicators were much better than 2013 and some media people and analysts were painting a bleak picture of the economy with wrongly quoted data and without considering the relevant perspective.The governor said the average gross domestic product growth during FY09 and FY13 was 2.8pc, which rose to 4.3pc during FY14 and FY16. Similarly, average inflation was 11.8pc during FY09-FY13 which fell to 5.3pc during FY14 and FY16.Moreover, the country\u2019s total public debt stock (excluding external liabilities) was Rs19.7 trillion as of June 2016. Of this, the domestic component was Rs13.6tr and the external component was Rs6.1tr. Thus, around 69.2pc of total debt was domestic.He said Pakistan\u2019s external debt has increased with an average growth of 6.2pc since 2013 and reached $57.7bn in FY16.

As reported on Thursday, around 100 Pakistani workers of a Saudi company, United Seemac, say they have not seen any pay cheques for several months. The period they have gone without pay ranges from nine to 16 months. If living in a foreign country with an empty pocket were not bad enough, the workers told this paper their residency permits had expired as their employer had not paid the renewal fee for the documents. This amounts to double jeopardy because if the workers are caught without valid residency documents by Saudi police, the consequences will be dire \u2014 most likely a one-way flight home after a stay in jail. These workers are not alone, as over 8,000 individuals employed by other Saudi firms have made similar complaints about inordinately delayed pay cheques.The Foreign Office and minister for overseas Pakistanis have said they are pursuing the matter. In fact, the minister concerned, Saddaruddin Shah Rashdi, was in the kingdom recently to discuss the matter with the Saudi authorities. However, the fact that he reportedly told a National Assembly standing committee on Tuesday that blowing the matter \u201cout of proportion\u201d may harm ties between Riyadh and Islamabad is indeed strange.

This stretch is also affected by the path of the train.The entrapped people cursed traffic wardens and the government. Clearing the traffic muddle itself looked out of control of the wardens some of them still tried to do the needful even when they were drenched in rainwater. Rain came all of a sudden at around 2pm after dark clouds covered the sky. Accompanied by strong wind, rain was heavy and torrential in the downtown where it soon turned streets into streams.It was the city\u2019s traffic system that was immediately disrupted. The second victim was the power supply which went missing for hours after rain tripped hundreds of feeders across the city.The prolonged jams were witnessed along the roads of the city canal, Jail Road, Ferozepur Road, Gulberg Main Boulevard, M M Alam Road and Shadman.The worst traffic muddles were witnessed on The Mall, Circular Roads, Lower Mall, Lakshmi Crossing, Lake Road up to Chauburji, Riwaz Garden, and Lytton Road from Jain Mandir to Mozang Chungi.There were no traffic wardens to clear the traffic. Those spotted appeared unable to do the needful as rainwater appeared a huge hurdle in the performance of their duty.Hundreds of vehicles including cars and motorcycles broke down on the inundated roads, further blocking the movement of traffic.

Pakistan\u2019s stance is superior to India\u2019s in terms of law, human rights and the wishes of the majority in the occupied Valley of Kashmir \u2014 which happens also to be the majority in India-held Kashmir. The enduring but as yet unexercised right of self-determination of the people of the whole of the former Jammu and Kashmir through a plebiscite is based on resolutions of the UN Security Council.The so-called accession of Kashmir to India has been condemned as invalid by a resolution of the UN Security Council. Whatever policy errors Pakistan may or may not have made the inalienable rights of the people of Kashmir cannot be derogated from.But the world is far from being a politically, legally or morally perfect place. Power, national interests, specious arguments, and changing priorities and concerns play a far greater role in shaping political developments. Pakistan has never cared to develop a longer-term policy or strategy towards Kashmir in which law and morality can have a larger impact on outcomes. It eschews longer-term approaches largely because it is an elitist and class-based security state. Accordingly, it shies away from popular movements even when they are for causes it formally espouses. As a result, economic transformation, participatory and institutionalised democracy, the full range of human rights and entitlements for all the people, and support for the \u2018Kashmir cause\u2019 are all rhetorically and symbolically espoused, often with great passion, while our leaders ensure no organised and sustained popular movements for their achievement are allowed to develop. Why? Because the power and class elites fear such movements would undermine the political status quo that sustains them.\nUnfortunately, Pakistan has never cared to develop a longer-term policy or strategy towards Kashmir.\n\nAccordingly, we have the paradox of an unjust status quo-based ruling elite pretending to seek a just solution to the Kashmir dispute. If a short-term solution was available this contradiction might not matter. But since there is in reality no short-term solution only a longer-term strategy can hope to alter the parameters of the Kashmir dispute. This has never been acceptable to the ruling elite in Pakistan because it would inevitably require change in the parameters of the political status quo in Pakistan itself.India as a largely status quo political entity seeking to preserve the status quo in Kashmir does not have to deal with this contradiction \u2014 especially in the real world \u2014 and even more so in the short term. Unfortunately, Pakistan\u2019s Kashmir policy \u2014 as an extension of its domestic politics \u2014 has been little more than an accumulation of unsuccessful shorter-term policies that have never added up to a longer-term strategy. Accordingly, it has never been able to exploit the longer-term weaknesses of the Indian stance and policies towards Kashmir. Moreover, other developments have favoured India over Pakistan. Both countries have acquired nuclear weapons capabilities. The international community is, accordingly, more concerned about preventing conflict and promoting even sterile dialogue and a modicum of interaction between them than forcing a just resolution to the Kashmir dispute over India\u2019s adamant opposition. India has also emerged as a potentially major player on the regional and global scene that none of the major powers wish to alienate. Pakistan, by contrast, has emerged with the image of a challenged and possibly failing state whose advocacy of the Kashmir cause has accordingly become a liability for the cause itself despite its validity. Instead of addressing these realities, the current frenetic diplomacy is aimed at answering domestic critics of the government\u2019s directionless Kashmir policy. India is indeed in a tight spot as a result of its abhorrent savagery in the Valley. The major powers are well informed about the human rights situation and have in varying degrees conveyed their concerns to India. But they remain by and large firmly committed to the view that only a territorially status quo-based \u2018solution\u2019 to the Kashmir dispute is feasible. This is true even of our dear friend China. Our delegates sent to various capitals will inevitably be confronted with the question: is Pakistan prepared to work towards a solution within these parameters, and if not, how will it bring an end to the agony of the people of the Valley and avoid a calamitous conflict with India? If their responses are largely statements about the moral and legal obligations of the international community to press India to implement the UN resolutions on Kashmir they will return with little to show. This does not imply Pakistan should itself disown these resolutions. What is the alternative to frenetic and fruitless diplomacy? It is a viable longer-term Kashmir and India strategy. There is of course no guarantee that a longer-term strategy will bear fruit given the extent of India\u2019s obduracy. But unless we can credibly commit to such a strategy there will be no chance of eliciting a positive and sustained policy response from the capitals of the world that could eventually impact on India. We shall be playing to our own political gallery. The Kashmiris of the Valley will have their worst suspicions of Pakistan reconfirmed. Their renewed faith in Pakistan will be dashed. Modi\u2019s cynical strategy of playing on a Kashmiri sense of isolation and hopelessness could ultimately begin to undermine the heroic resistance of an essentially abandoned Kashmiri youth.How will our delegates contextualise their advocacy of the immediate imperatives of the Kashmir situation within a longer-term strategy for a settlement acceptable to the Kashmiri people as well as India and Pakistan when we have no such strategy? No matter how difficult and risky it may be to contemplate any improvement of ties with India today, an exploration of this possibility combined with an alleviation of the human and political rights situation in the Valley and a search for a longer-term compromise settlement acceptable to Kashmiri opinion is the only way forward. All other approaches are insincere. The prime minister, accordingly, needs to make a seminal statement delineating the outlines of a longer-term Kashmir strategy.The writer is a former ambassador to the US, India and China and head of UN missions in Iraq and Sudan.Published in Dawn, September 2nd, 2016\n", "author": "Ashraf Jehangir Qazi", "title": "Advocating Kashmir"}}

But some health experts believe that not a single goal can be achieved unless funds are allocated. The Director General of Ministry of National Health Services, Dr Asad Hafeez, claims that all goals will be achieved as for the first time in the country\u2019s history funding for the health sector has been declared investment instead of expenditure. The policy\nThe last Nation Health Policy was announced in 2001. Though efforts were made in 2010 to introduce a new policy, they could not succeed. Recently, the topic of health was included in the Vision 2025 of the Planning Division, but it was dealt with in just a few paragraphs. Therefore, the government decided to introduce a separate NHV. An official of the ministry said that currently Pakistan was spending 0.5 per cent of its GDP on health and it had been decided to raise the allocation for the sector to 3pc of GDP by 2025. \u201cCurrently, there is no plan about human resources in the health sector as a result there are more doctors than nurses in the country. Therefore, a system will be evolved to produce doctors, nurses, paramedics and other staff as per requirements,\u201d he said. \u201cAt present data of different health departments and the provincial governments is hardly used for decision making. Under the NHV, a national information system will be established to store data and use it,\u201d he said. \u201cCurrently there is no mechanism to regulate what kind of facilities should be provided by primary, secondary and tertiary care hospitals. In the private sector, clinics are established in shops, houses and rooms. In future, service, equipment and staff will be defined for government and private hospitals and clinics,\u201d the official said. \u201cThough the health sector has been devolved to the provinces, international orga\u00ad\u00adnisations treat the country as one unit. There are 13 indicators regarding health in the Sustainable Develop\u00adment Goals. The indicators can differ in different provinces but at the international level one indicator will be quoted,\u201d he said. Monitoring mechanism\nTherefore, a monitoring report mechanism has been included in the NHV under which the provincial and federal governments will be bound to table annual health reports in assemblies. With the help of these reports, a holistic picture about the status of public health in the country will emerge. The document points out that Pakistan is facing a double burden of disease (BoD). The burden is higher among the poor, and many of these conditions can be controlled at relatively low-cost interventions. Communicable disea\u00adses, maternal health issues and under-nutrition dominate and constitute about half of the BoD. \u201cIn young children, diarrhoea and respiratory illness remain major killers. Maternal deaths due to preventable causes... are common. \u201cVaccine preventable diseases and new emerging infections call for strengthening disease surveillance and response system uniformly across the country,\u201d the document says. Dr Asad Hafeez said the document had defined federal and provincial health functions. Because of this, responsibilities have been re-arranged. \u201cAfter 10 years Pakistan will be far ahead and better in the health sector as compared to today.\u201d But a health expert said the government had announced the last National Health Policy in 2001 but it was not implemented during the next 10 years. \u201cThe ministry should have prepared another document, along with the NHV, to fix responsibility for the failure of implementation of the 2001 policy,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThis time also, allocation of funds will remain a major problem in addressing the health issues.\u201d Published in Dawn, September 2nd, 2016\n", "author": "Ikram Junaidi", "title": "National health vision identifies critical issues"}}

He was speaking at the concluding session of a two-day seminar on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor and Gilgit-Baltistan. The army chief spoke about the overall fight against terrorism, security of corridor projects, strategic importance of Gilgit-Baltistan and its role in the CPEC. \u201cLet [Indian Prime Minister Narendra] Modi and RAW know that our borders are secure. We know our enemy and its conspiracies and we will leave no stone unturned to defeat those plots,\u201d he said while speaking about the threats to the project from India. Delhi, it may be recalled, has publicly adopted a hostile posture on the CPEC and tried to dissuade China, during its bilateral interactions, from engaging with Pakistan in the project. This was the second time since last year\u2019s Defence Day celebrations at the GHQ that the army chief directly responded to the Indian leadership. Prime Minister Modi had in his country\u2019s independence day speech last month accused Pakistan of suppressing the rights of people in Balochistan, Gilgit-Baltistan and Azad Kashmir. Although there was no direct reference to the CPEC in the speech, it is inferred that the remarks were also aimed at China, which is investing in those regions as part of the $46 billion communications and infrastructure project. Gen Raheel gave an overview of the progress made so far towards the establishment of a dedicated special security division for the CPEC, which the military had announced soon after the visit to Pakistan of Chinese President Xi Jinping last year. He said the northern wing of the CPEC security division had already been raised, while the process for establishment of the southern wing had been initiated. The northern wing will cater to the security of the projects situated between Khunjerab on the border with China and Rawalpindi, while the rest of the projects will be looked after by the southern wing. The army chief for the first time publicly shared the responsibilities envisaged for the upcoming security division. \u201cTheir responsibilities would range from being first responders in case of threats to nuclear energy projects with China to advising and supporting law enforcement agencies that would be in the lead for security of other projects,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cThey would be advising, indirectly controlling and, at times, directing the law enforcement agencies.\u201d TerrorismGen Raheel said Pakistan\u2019s fight against terrorism was \u201ca war for its survival\u201d. Reiterating his pledge to take the fight to its logical conclusion, he said the facilitators, abettors and financiers of terrorists \u201cwould be sorted out and eliminated\u201d for ensuring peace and security in the country. In this regard, he said, the army would break the evil nexus of corruption, crime and terrorism. Speaking at the seminar, Commander of 10 Corps Lt Gen Malik Zafar Iqbal said the northern wing of the CPEC security division would start working soon. Emphasising the importance of security for development projects, he said those ventures could not be possible without a secured and enabling environment. Gen Iqbal said a major challenge to the CPEC came from regional and extra-regional players. \u201cEvery sacrifice would be made for the success of the project,\u201d he added.Published in Dawn, September 2nd, 2016\n", "author": "Baqir Sajjad Syed", "title": "Army chief warns Modi, RAW over plots against CPEC"}}

{"1281556": {"date": "Updated September 02, 2016", "article": "GWADAR: Considered to be the backbone of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), Gwadar has been in the grip of a water crisis over the last several years. Owing to the neglect of the provincial government, residents of Gwadar are compelled to collect water from distant areas of the district. Gwadar residents say many people have left the port city because of the water crisis.The major source of water in Gwadar is rainwater, collected and stored in the Ankara Daur dam. Completed in 1993, the dam was built at a time when Gwadar\u2019s population was far smaller than it is today. This is why the port city\u2019s reservoir is not enough to serve the needs of the current population of the district. Sometimes, due to long drought spells, the reservoir dries up. There is no other source of drinking water for the Gwadar people than the Ankara Daur dam.\u201cIn Gwadar, we get water supply at home after four or five days. Usually, we buy well water from donkey cart operators. Sometimes, our women have to go from door to door to seek even a bucketful of water,\u201d says Mohammad Ilyas Baloch, a resident of the port city.\u201cThose who can afford it buy water from tanker operators, but that is too expensive for a majority of the population.\u201dLocal newspapers often report government officials and politicians saying that they are trying their best to overcome Gwadar\u2019s water crisis. Because of the CPEC, they say, the strategic importance of Gwadar has increased manifold, which is why they will leave no stone unturned for Gwadar people\u2019s well-being, and resolving the water issue is their top priority.Speaking to Dawn, Mariyam Suleman, a local social scientist, says: \u201cDuring retired General Pervez Musharraf\u2019s regime the Mirani dam, about 150 kilometres from Gwadar city, was constructed to overcome the city\u2019s water crisis. It only needs laying pipeline to supply water to the city, but this government is not doing even that much. Several meetings of the relevant committees were held during the acute water shortage we faced this year as well as in 2012. But once it rains, and the water crisis eases, everything fades into oblivion and there is no proper planning for a lasting water supply. Of course, the Ankara Daur dam alone cannot fulfil the people\u2019s water needs.\u201dTalking to Dawn, Siddique Baloch, a senior journalist who has exhaustively written on the Gwadar port project, says there are 360 seasonal rivers in Makran and five big rivers in its nearby coastal areas. This means there are many potential new sources of water to alleviate the current crisis in Gwadar in particular and Makran in general, provided the government builds necessary storage facilities on them.\u201cIran\u2019s Chabahar Port, some 72km from Gwadar, does not face any water crisis,\u201d says Baloch. \u201cThe reason for this is that, unlike our government, they overcame the water crisis by working on it. But we, despite having potential sources for water, seem uninterested in resolving the water crisis in Gwadar.\u201dAnswering a question, Suleman says: \u201cI do not personally see any progress being made by the government in resolving the water crisis. In 2012, when Gwadar was severely hit by this crisis, government officials had vowed to resolve it. Later on, they merely made committees and did nothing tangible. This is why the port city is facing a water issue today.\u201cHowever,\u201d she recalls, \u201cI do hear about the Sawad dam, which has been in progress for several years [If completed, the dam will be nearer to Gwadar than the Mirani dam]. The dam was expected to be completed by 2014, but there are no signs of its completion soon.\u201dDr Shahid Ahmad, an expert on water affairs and author of several papers on the water crisis in Gwadar, says: \u201cFirst, water can be brought to Gwadar from the Mirani dam, which is situated in the neighbouring district of Kech. But before that, we have to keep in mind the following questions: how to deal with the local people who have preferential right on the water? Will they allow it? If they allow it, what will be their conditions for it? These questions and conflicts need to be addressed by the government before bringing water from there [the Mirani dam] to Gwadar.\u201dSecondly, he says, there are several feasible sites around Gwadar where dams can be built, as well as the existing ones improved, if the government takes due interest in it.Thirdly, another option the government can explore is desalinisation of seawater. However, he says, the government cannot do this alone. Instead, the government should install and lease desalination plants to the private sector for better functioning and to ensure that Gwadar\u2019s water problem is solved permanently.

[Now] I feel happy,\u201d Messi said.Argentina's new coach Edgardo Bauza meanwhile saluted Messi's commitment in returning to play despite his niggling groin problem.The coach hinted Messi may be rested for Argentina's next match, against Venezuela on Tuesday. \u201cIf he's not right we won't risk him,\u201d Bauza said.\u201cI know how painful it is to suffer a groin injury \u2013 but Messi's character meant he was always going to stay on the pitch tonight.\u201d Argentina's win came after a superb backs-to-the-wall defensive effort in the second half when they had been reduced to 10 men following the dismissal of young Juventus striker Paulo Dybala just before half-time.Dybala, 22, was escorted from the pitch in tears after the red card.Jesus the saviour for Brazil\nArgentina's win leaves them in first place in South America's marathon round-robin qualifying campaign with 14 points from seven games.Elsewhere Thursday, there was an impressive win for Brazil over Ecuador in the thin air of Quito, which is situated a dizzying 2,850 meters (9,350 feet) above sea level.Brazil had never won a qualifying game in the Ecuadoran capital before, but two goals from teenage prodigy Gabriel Jesus and a penalty from Neymar handed the five-time world champions a 3-0 victory.Jesus, the 19-year-old who signed for English side Manchester City from Palmeiras in August, was outstanding, underscoring his status as the brightest talent in Brazilian football.Jesus won the penalty for the first goal after bursting into the area and drawing a foul from Ecuador goalkeeper Alexander Dominguez.Neymar duly converted before Jesus doubled Brazil's lead three minutes from time with a sublime flicked finish from Marcelo's low cross to make it 2-0.Jesus, who like Neymar had played in Brazil's gold medal-winning Olympic football campaign, then added a third in stoppage time with a crisp finish into the top corner.The win left Brazil in fifth place overall in the standings with 12 points from seven games.In other matches on Thursday, Colombia defeated Venezuela 2-0 in their port city stronghold of Barranquilla.Goals from Real Madrid star James Rodriguez and Macnelly Torres secured the points for Colombia, who would have won by more had it not been for two missed penalties in the final 10 minutes.The win leaves Colombia level with Ecuador and Uruguay on 13 points, just behind leaders Argentina.Paraguay meanwhile are level on 12 points with Brazil after scoring a stormy 2-1 win over South American champions Chile in Asuncion.Oscar Romero and Paulo da Silva fired Paraguay 2-0 up after only nine minutes before Arturo Vidal pulled a goal back just before half-time.A fractious second half ended with Chile defender Gary Medel being sent off in the closing stages as Paraguay held on.In the day's other game, Bolivia defeated Peru 2-0 in La Paz.\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Messi makes scoring return, Brazil sink Ecuador"}}

The latest addition to the Note series went on sale in some markets, including South Korea and the United States, on Aug 19. \"There have been 35 cases that have been reported globally,\" Samsung said in an official statement, adding that it had conducted a thorough inspection with suppliers to identify possible affected batteries in the market. Units which have already been sold will be replaced by the company in the next few weeks, Samsung said.Shipments of the Galaxy Note 7 smartphone were delayed in South Korea this week for extra quality control testing. The move came after reports that batteries in some of the jumbo smartphones exploded while they were being charged. Citing an unnamed company official, South Korea's Yonhap News Agency said Samsung's investigation found that faulty batteries caused the phone to catch fire. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKoh Dong-jin bows at a news conference in Seoul after announcing the voluntary recall \u2500 AP\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nYonhap News said five or six explosions were reported by consumers.

Samsung's share rose 0.8pc early Friday. The stock closed 2pc lower in the previous session.Despite the investigation in South Korea, Samsung went ahead with its scheduled launch Thursday of the Galaxy Note 7 in China. It is unusual for Samsung to confirm a delay in sales of a device, and rare for it to cite a quality issue.\"Every year, there have been accidents of battery explosions but it is the first time that six or seven cases happened within such a short period after the launch of a new product,\"  said Ha Joon-doo, an analyst at Shinhan Investment Corp.The Galaxy Note 7 smartphone is the latest iteration of Samsung's Note series that feature a giant screen and a stylus. The Note series smartphones are one of the most expensive lineups released by Samsung and usually inherit designs and features of the Galaxy S series that debut in the spring. Samsung also added an iris scanner to the Note 7, which lets users unlock the phone by detecting patterns in the eyes.Even before the issue of battery explosions emerged, supplies were not keeping up with higher-than-expected demand for the smartphone. \n", "author": "AP | Dawn.com", "title": "Samsung to recall Galaxy Note 7 smartphone after explosion claims"}}

{"1281636": {"date": "September 03, 2016", "article": "KHYBER Pakhtunkhwa has been attacked once again, and once again a familiar set of questions have arisen about the seeming ease with which multiple suicide bombers and fidayeen attackers were able to arrive at their targets in the heart of the province. A day earlier, the ISPR chief had asserted that significant successes have been notched up in the fight against militancy, but the attacks in Mardan and Peshawar have reinforced that a long and complicated fight still lies ahead. While the military is keen to discuss its successes in the various operations ongoing across the country, perhaps it should also be more candid about the extant threats and the terror networks that are still operational. The need for a more realistic outlook is essential for the public, otherwise the incongruity of a military claiming successes while attacks continue in various parts of the country will only add to the national confusion.While responsibility for yesterday\u2019s attacks cannot yet be known definitively, the claim by Jamaatul Ahrar does seem credible. Alarmingly, not only does the banned TTP faction appear to have a growing reach, from Quetta to Peshawar, but its resources, manpower and organisational capacity seem to be growing. Pakistani security officials point the finger of blame at Afghanistan, where TTP militants have apparently found sanctuary in the eastern region bordering Pakistan and where sections of the state and intelligence apparatus are evincing a renewed hostility towards this country. Addressing the evolved TTP threat has not proved easy because it involves everything from military strategy to national security and foreign policy to border management. Unhappily, not only does the necessary military and civilian cooperation here appear non-existent, but there is perhaps a fundamental divergence over the path ahead. \nWhile the civilian government rightly emphasises a policy of peace and reconciliation with neighbouring countries, it seems to have neither the space nor the inclination to deal with a tough set of national security and foreign policy challenges. Yesterday, the anomalous situation was on display yet again as Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif inaugurated one more road project and talked about Pakistan being on the path to prosperity \u2014 while Peshawar and Mardan were bleeding yet again.Where the civilian government may be out of ideas or lack space, the military establishment seems far too keen on externalising blame rather than working towards understanding the sustained and simultaneously evolving militant threat. Wherever the Jamaatul Ahrar leadership may be based, the attacks are taking place deep inside Pakistan. Why is the intelligence apparatus always one step behind the militants? Peshawar and Mardan were no lone-wolf attacks and likely required a network of individuals to facilitate the attackers. While the bravery of security personnel helped limit the damage, it is virtually impossible to stop a suicide bomber who has already been deployed.

The seminar titled \u201cEqbal Ahmed: A citizen of the world\u201d was organised by the Government College University (GCU) Quality Enhancement Cell under the auspices of the Punjab Higher Education Commission (PHEC) to pay a tribute to the anti-war activist who was a rare combination of academic excellence and intellectual skepticism, and was globally admired and consulted by policymakers and academics. The speakers said Ahmad\u2019s life experiences shaped his political views. They said he grew up amidst the turmoil of postcolonial India, worked alongside the Algerian National Liberation Front in its fight against the French occupation and later became a prominent spokesperson for peace between Israel and Palestine. In his opening remarks, PHEC chairman Prof Dr Nizamuddin said that Khaldunia remained Eqbal Ahmad\u2019s living dream and the focus of his considerable energies until last. He said the commission would take up the project with the government. He shed light on different perspectives of his life, including the striking moral character, he maintained throughout his life. Prof Dr Pervez Hoodbhoy, an eminent nuclear physicist and writer, reminded Nawaz Sharif that he in his first tenure as prime minister had assured Mr Ahmad to provide land to build Khaldunia University. He said later the late Benazir Bhutto did not carry forward the project apparently because Mr Ahmad had criticised policies of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto during his regime. Richard Anderson Falk, an eminent American professor emeritus of international law at Princeton University, said there was a need for universities which produced global citizens having empathy, respect and love for every nation irrespective of their faith, caste, colour and creed. He discussed in detail the struggle of Mr Ahmed, his political and academic views and interesting incidents from their longstanding friendship. Other speakers said that Mr Ahmed was a fierce opponent of imperialism and advocated democratic transformations in postcolonial and third-world societies. Whether writing on the rise of militant Islam, the conflict in Kashmir, US involvement in Vietnam, or the cynical logic of cold war geopolitics, Mr Ahmad offered incisive and passionate analyses of major political events and movements of the second half of the twentieth century, they said. About the writings of Eqbal Ahmed, GCU QEC Iram Sohail quoted American philosopher, Noam Choomsky: \u201cIt is a fascinating experience to view major events of the past half century through Eqbal Ahmed\u2019s discerning eye.\u201d GCU\u2019s Faculty of Arts and Social Sciences dean Prof Dr Tahir Kamran and Dr Kamran Asdar Ali from University of Texas, Austin, also addressed the seminar which was attended by a large number of faculty members and postgraduate students from different universities.Published in Dawn, September 3rd, 2016\n", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter", "title": "Rich tributes paid to prolific writer Eqbal Ahmad"}}

The event, organised by the British Council and the Walled City of Lahore Authority, was a well attended affair on Friday. The session on \u2018Integrating Intangible and Tangible Heritage\u2019, moderated by Razia Sadik, an art educator, scholar and curator, had a lot to offer about common perceptions, reactions and feelings of the general folks in Pakistan and abroad on integration of intangible and tangible heritage. The panelists of the session were Joanne Orr, CEO \nMuseums Galleries, Scotland and Dr Farida Batool, an artist and researcher from Lahore. Ms Orr held the historical city of Lahore in high esteem, saying she was delighted to see this amazing city. She told the audience that Scotland had 460 museums which work on the philosophy of \u201crun by the community and for the community.\u201d Elaborating intangible cultural heritage, she listed out a number of things such as customs, traditions, living culture and last but not the least the cultural diversity. She said the museums galleries in Scotland were a national development body. \u201cWe provide a platform to bring people together so that they could share ideas on the subject\u201d. She said the living culture was the manifestation of oral traditions, performing arts, social patterns, rituals and festivals. She said 56pc of people were volunteers who provide services at the museum.\u201d Dr Farida Batool spoke on a project of hers -- an installation, a web of lights that traverses the roofs of old city homes where once Basant used to be celebrated with great fervor. The project Awami Art Collective, a project in the Walled City, basically raised multiple questions on government\u2019s banning of Basant festival whereas the festival not only had historical value but was a great income generator for the local folks. The project she discussed in detail also had a reference to the project on the city and the heritage sites being demolished under the name of \u2018development\u2019. Ms Batool wondered why government didn\u2019t regulate festivals or such activities. Giving an example in this regard, she said shutting ways leading to healthy activity was no solution. Things should be regulated instead of putting to an end. She, however, praised the government for constituting a committee for the revival of Basant. The session on \u2018Museums in Pakistan: State of Play and What\u2019s Next\u2019 was moderated by Joanne Orr and the panelists were Abdul Samad, Director Archeology, KP, Mian Attique Ahmed, secretary general Museums Association and Asma Ibrahim, director State Bank of Pakistan Museum. Mr Samad, while showing a documentary on the achievements of the archaeology department, came up with a broad spectrum of heritage scene in KP. He mentioned how the department made efforts to reunite and bring together the master craftsmen of the region to revive the traditional crafts. He also shared information on the artisan village they had established and how encouraging were the remarks they were receiving nationally and internationally. Mr Samad said the department was soon to open an E-Bazaar where online buying would be possible for traditional musical instruments such as rubab. Mian Attique underlined the need for establishing regional history museums in the districts. \u201cI have established 14 museums in Pakistan but we need regional history museums\u201d. Asma Ibrahim said a lot had been changed about museums in Pakistan as many museums had gone digital and were playing a positive role in reviving the traditional crafts.

So much so that when I was at school in Paris, and asked to escort a visiting aunt around the city, I recall her giggling at all the nudity. Later at home, she said to my mother: \u201cHai, Hamida, I should take some fabric and dress those poor naked women!\u201dAdmiration for the undressed human form in the West dates back to the classical Greek period when athletes at the original Olympic Games competed in the nude. During the French revolution in 1789, a female figure came to depict Liberty and Reason, and adorned official pronouncements and posters of the day.\nHow did the burkini come to occupy centre stage in French politics?\n\nShe was transformed into the person of Marianne in 1848, and became the symbol of the French Republic. This is the allegorical personage Manuel Valls, the French prime minister, referred to in his recent speech where he said:\u201cMarianne has a bare breast because she is feeding the people. She is not veiled, because she is free. That is the Republic!\u201dExcept, of course, Valls mixed up his classical allusions: Marianne is not depicted with an exposed breast. He was probably referring to the 1830 Delacroix painting Liberty Leading the People, in which a female figure with a bare breast is leading a group of revolutionaries.While Valls was duly chastised and ridiculed in France for his ignorance, the episode shows the lengths to which French politicians will go in their quest to revile the burkini, the outfit of choice for Muslim women visiting the beaches of France. This swimwear which encompasses the body while allowing freedom of movement is now the focus of a legal battle.Banned in several French towns along the Mediterranean as a response to the recent acts of jihadist terrorism that have shaken the country, the edict has been mocked and criticised across the world. Although the French administrative court has suspended the ban, several mayors are defying this decision, thus placing Fran\u00e7ois Hollande\u2019s government in a quandary.In the wake of the terrorist attacks, the right has gained support for its anti-immigration (read Islamophobic) views and policies. In the presidential election due next year, Marine Le Pen\u2019s hard right National Front is expected to do well. Even normally liberal politicians like Valls are being forced to assume right-wing positions on immigration.So how did the burkini come to occupy centre stage in French politics? The daily Midi Libre has called it an \u201costentatious religious symbol\u201d, while Valls dubbed it \u201cthe expression of a political project, a counter-society, based notably on the enslavement of women\u201d.The widespread perception is that the burkini, the burqa and other similar outfits have been forced on women by their fathers, husbands and brothers, and that those who wear them have no choice in the matter. But this is an oversimplification: the mothers of many young women who choose to cover themselves do not wear the niqab or the burqa, and are often puzzled by the insistence their daughters display in their choice of all-concealing garments. Since the 1980s, the Muslim world \u2014 as well as Muslims in the Diaspora \u2014 has become more conservative and more outwardly religious. In large measure, this is the result of the Saudi export of their orthodox Salafi/Wahabi beliefs through their financing of madressahs across the Islamic world. In the West, the House of Saud has spent lavishly in building mosques, and paying the salaries of preachers as well as sending poisonous teaching material.  These evangelical activities have produced a generation of Muslims who have a far narrower vision of the world than their parents did. And these rigid views have created an environment where extremism has flourished. Hence the reluctance to integrate into the social and cultural milieu Muslims in the West have chosen to live in. Simultaneously, the rise of brutal violence in the name of Islam has antagonised millions in the non-Muslim world. And when this terrorism is carried out by radicals who were born and brought up in the West, it is doubly terrifying. From this perspective, it is easy to understand where Islamophobia, even among normally tolerant people, springs from.In the case of France, there is a cultural superiority complex at work as well. Having long viewed itself as the centre of fashion and culture, it has seen its pre-eminent position taken by the US and the UK. And now, the millions of Muslims living in France are refusing to accept the country\u2019s cultural norms by insisting on their own food, languages and dress. The burkini was one transgression too many.We are all born naked into this world, and leave it in a shroud. In between these two events, surely we should be free to dress as we please.  irfan.husain@gmail.comPublished in Dawn, September 3rd, 2016\n", "author": "Irfan Husain", "title": "The burkini wars"}}

Malaria virus could be used for the treatment of cancer after tailoring the genes.

The establishment of state-of\u2013the-art slaughterhouses in the region is the need of the hour to ensure provision of healthy meat to the people,\u201d he told Dawn.The local residents complain in the absence of proper abattoirs, butchers slaughter animals on the roadside and in open areas ignoring standard practices.They say the circumstances have left them no option but to consume whatever meat is sold on the market, which is mostly unhygienic.Rahmat Shah Afridi, a resident of Jamrud, said a few years ago, there used to be a slaughterhouse where animals ready for slaughter were checked by a local veterinarian.He said the people had to buy unhealthy meat due to the absence of proper checking on meat sellers.The man demanded the re-activation of the bazaar committee to ensure quality meat to the people.An official at the Fata secretariat insists around 60 permits are issued daily to a \u2018permit mafia\u2019 in Khyber Agency, while local butchers illegally transport meat from Peshawar to the area in vehicles after bribing the personnel manning security checkpoints.\u201cPermits meant for local butchers are issued to a \u2018mafia\u2019, which use them to transport meat to Afghanistan through Bazaar Zakhakhel Subi Kandau area,\u201d he told Dawn.The official disclosed as no food inspector had been deployed in Landi Kotal Bazaar, a sanitation officer did the job of a veterinarian and food inspector.He even said he didn\u2019t know if the meat sold in the region was halal.The official said it was basically the job of local administrations to ensure the supply of clean, good and disease-free meat to the people in their respective regions and that, too, at a reason price.\u201cRed meat is supplied to the adjoining tribal areas from Peshawar and other settled areas of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa daily in trucks and vans but there is no mechanism to check their quality and therefore, the local residents have to consume unhealthy meat, a major reason for high incidence of infections and diseases,\u201d Mukhtar Wali, a resident of Orakzai Agency said.A local official told Dawn the tribal agency\u2019s headquarters had some slaughterhouses few years ago but they all closed down due to the administration\u2019s negligence.\u201cNot a single slaughterhouse is functional, now. Butchers slaughter big and small animals without caring for unhygienic conditions and thus, threatening the health of consumers,\u201d he said.The official said the administration was indifferent to the people\u2019s health issues by and large, butchers slaughtered sick, underage and female animals at will.Sadaqat Jan Afridi, a resident of Landi Kotal, said the red meat supplied from Peshawar to local market was unfit for human consumption as it was exposed to heat and dust and was transported in uncovered trucks and vans.He said the area had high incidence of infections and diseases due to consumption of unhealthy meat in the absence of proper slaughterhouses.Journalist Wali Khan Shinwari said butchers bribed the relevant administration officials to sell unhygienic meat.He said Fata had no food inspectors or veterinarians to check the quality of red meat sold on the market.The journalist said veterinary posts had long been lying vacant throughout Fata and thus, endangering livestock.An official at the offices of the Khyber agency political agent said permits were issued only to local butchers, while relevant officials of the administration regularly visited butcher shops to check the quality of meat sold and those selling unhealthy meat were dealt with strictly.\u201cThe local administration keeps a close eye on the quality and prices of consumer goods, including meat,\u201d he said.Another official at the Fata secretariat said modern slaughterhouses would be set up in tribal agencies.He said once sufficient funds were secured from the relevant quarters, slaughterhouses along scientific lines would be established in Fata to ensure healthy and fresh meat to tribesmen.Director (livestock and dairy development) Dr Malik Ayaz Wazir said 38 of the 47 posts of veterinary officers in Fata were vacant.He however said the vacancies would be filled soon.

Because of the lack of support from private institutions, it seems unlikely that admissions will be made according to a centralised merit list. Private colleges have started advertising admissions. PMDC President Dr Shabbir Lehri said all the stakeholders had agreed on a centralised merit list during a meeting last month, and it was strange that they were expressing concerns now. \nMeetings will discuss private colleges\u2019 complaints regarding a centralised admissions test, singular merit list\n\n\u201cBecause of the sensitivity of the issue, emergency meetings have been called and hopefully the council will address the issue with collective wisdom,\u201d he said. Last month, the Ministry of National Health Services (NHS) decided on a centralised test for all medical and dental colleges in the federal capital, as well as one merit list for public and private medical colleges in order to prevent corrupt behaviour. The decision was made during a meeting on a uniform admission policy chaired by NHS Minister Saira Afzal Tarar, attended by vice chancellors of federal chartered universities and principals of public and private medical and dental colleges. The meeting had decided that a public sector university would hold a centralised test for all medical and dental colleges, and a singular merit list would make it eaiser to ensure that candidates are not admitted to institutions in violation of merit.On August 26, the NHS ministry issued a notification, available with Dawn, that constituted a Federal Examination and Admission Committee to carry out the aforementioned centralised test. The committee is chaired by the NHS ministry director general and includes representatives from the PMDC, the Higher Education Commission and principals of medical colleges that will oversee the entire admissions process. However, an official from a private college said several concerns had rendered the new mechanism unacceptable to private colleges. There are six private and one public sector medical colleges in Islamabad. \u201cThere is no big difference between Rawalpindi and Islamabad, so separate rules should not be introduced for both cities. It was proposed that the Shaheed Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Medical University would hold the centralised test, as some private universities are chartered university so they can admit their students. It seems strange that one university will admit students for another university,\u201d he said. \u201cOne formula should be introduced all over the country instead of just in one city,\u201d he added. \u201cAnother issue is that we just have a month to complete admissions. For the centralised test, there should be a question bank and many other requirements. Currently, knowledge-based tests have been suggested, but some colleges prefer aptitude tests for admissions.\u201d\u201cIn addition, 80pc of students in colleges in the federal capital get admission from outside the capital, such as Fata. So an arrangement has to be made to hold exams in all the provinces, Fata, Gilgit-Baltistan, but there is no such arrangement,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is no criterion for what happens if 100 students are referred to a college and some don\u2019t get admission. How will more students be referred to colleges, and if a student leaves during the session, how will the vacant seat be filled?\u201dDr Lehri said he agreed with some of the complaints put forward by private institutions. \u201cThe time period is very short,\u201d he admitted. \u201cWe have called emergency meetings of the executive council and the council on Tuesday and Wednesday, respectively, to address the matter,\u201d he said.\u201cWe don\u2019t want to close down the colleges or reduce their business, so those kinds of issues will be addressed and discussed during the meetings.\u201dPublished in Dawn, September 4th, 2016\n", "author": "Ikram Junaidi", "title": "PMDC to call emergency meetings of executive council"}}

He was doing foundation course at the National College of Arts when replicating the drawings and paintings of the artists of the Renaissance period became his passion; a strong inspiration which made a lasting impact on his art practices.Born and raised in Karachi, Irfan Hasan was inclined to drawing from a tender age. His family had an exposure to visual arts because of one of his grand parents who studied the art of sculpture at Mayo School of Arts (which was later  named NCA), before the Partition.\u201cWhile learning the basics of drawings I got attracted to human figure. The nudes painted by old masters were a great fascination, a new world to explore as an art student\u201d, Hasan says.\u201cI became an apprentice to Aqeel Solangi who taught me figure drawing and encouraged me to paint. A replica of painting by senior painter Kaleem Khan was my first serious work\u201d, he vividly recalls.He always loved working in details but while training in the discipline of miniature painting, his approach was different from that of his teachers.\u201cThe traditional miniatures are stylised and two dimensional. I would paint them in minute detail, render them carefully but unlike the Mughal and Persian paintings which are flat and two dimensional, I ended up with an illusion of three dimensional visual like the Western painters\u201d, he says.He would paint figures from art books rendered delicately employing traditional miniature painting techniques and materials in his sketchbook. One of his friends suggested him to compose these figures to develop his own paintings as well. That\u2019s how he created his body of work in which he picked images of Western masters and fuse them with his personal narrative.\u201cMy training as miniaturist and the academic practice to execute the large-scale works in details helped me a great deal to develop these visuals\u201d, he acknowledges.Working as a whole-time artist since his graduation in 2006, with six solo shows to his credit, his works are gradually evolving and going through various phases. Either stylised, surreal or realistic the human figure remained the \nmainstay of his paintings.His recent body of work -- a series of portraits --will be displayed in a solo show titled \u2018Children of ambiguity\u2019 by the end of this month.\u201cThey (portraits) are real Pakistani characters who resembled the humans portrayed by European painters, like \u2018A boy from Malakand\u2019 resembled exactly the portraits of Jesus. Similarly, Hasan\u2019s \u2018A girl from Chitral\u2019 resembled the painting \u2018A girl with pearl earring\u2019 by Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer.\u201cDuring research I found people with Moroccan and African features in Sindh and the old men in FATA who resemble the characters sitting besides Christ in Italian painter Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio\u2019s. I was amused to see the Jewish customs and traditions followed by Afridi tribes,\u201d he explains.\u201cIt inspired me to further study the genetic roots of various races settled in this area from centuries, and I can relate this work to my passion for European paintings\u201d , he added.He works with very thin layres of water based paint with dry brush on paper, the details are done by fine brush strokes like traditional miniaturists. Most of his works, especially larger than life portraits, reflecting his sound skills and good command on the medium, create a stunningly strong visual impact.Published in Dawn, September 4th, 2016\n", "author": "Naeem Sadhu", "title": "Highlighting racial origins through portraits"}}

The ones who see things differently. They\u2019re not fond of rules. And they have no respect for the status quo,\u201d ran the eulogy of Apple\u2019s Think Different television advertisement in 1997. In the same spirit, here\u2019s to Margrethe Vestager.The EU competition commissioner insists she is not deliberately making trouble by deciding this week that Ireland should levy \u20ac13bn in taxes that it allowed the company to underpay over a decade. \u201cNo rules have been changed - not one,\u201d she retorted to the accusation that she is ripping up international tax treaties and diverting US tax revenues to Europe. She looked unperturbed by the rumpus. Ms Vestager seems to have taken lessons from Apple about presentation. Her original 2014 complaint against the company was jammed with details. This week\u2019s update was pared down and clean, making the argument simply. Steve Jobs might have appreciated the elegant Danish design, although the content infuriated the US and Irish governments - and Tim Cook, Jobs\u2019s successor as Apple chief executive.Its simplicity is both a weakness and a strength. The weakness is that it is hard to believe it will hold up in court, where the argument is heading. There is something a bit too neat about the way Ms Vestager sliced through the Gordian knot of transfer pricing and tax residency with one stroke by declaring Apple\u2019s three-decade-old arrangements with Ireland invalid.Corporate tax is a complex matter: intellectual property can be moved to offshore locations and exploited at arm\u2019s length according to intricate related-party formulas; sales in one country can become revenues in another; US companies can invert themselves to somewhere else. If any tax arrangement that beats others can be outlawed as selective state aid, a lot of tax lawyers are out of work.\nEnter Ms Vestager, with her plan to make Ireland retrieve \u20ac13bn, and to let other EU countries stake their own claims to the money \u2026Her boldness will change the rules of global taxation if it survives\nthe legal challenges\nMs Vestager\u2019s strength is that none of that makes much sense, or feels justifiable, to individual taxpayers. \u201cIf my effective tax rate would be 0.05pc, falling to 0.005pc, I would have felt that maybe I should have a second look at my tax bill,\u201d she said. Apple insists that it paid $400m in taxes in Ireland in 2014, but her rhetoric was powerful.Apple sounded quite flustered as it protested that things are not as they appear. On tax matters, it resembles the nerdy PC character in its \u2018Get a Mac\u2019 campaign in the 2000s, with Ms Vestager as the cool, cocksure Mac. The more it explains that it has deferred taxation, not avoided it, the more conventionally corporate it looks.Its tax challenge is straightforward enough, and is common to a lot of US companies. It produces most of its value - its intellectual property and distinct approach to technology and design - in California. Under existing global tax treaties, it could legitimately channel most profits from around the world back to the US through royalty fees on overseas sales.                     It does not want to do this because that would involve paying up to 35 per cent tax in the US on the profits compared with Ireland\u2019s 12.5pc rate. The simple answer, as Ms Vestager points out, would be to pay the latter instead; Apple is structured so it could easily do so. Its Irish subsidiaries hold royalty rights for European sales and most profits flow there.But Ireland used to offer a twist: the right to form companies that were not tax resident there or in the US. Rather than pay taxes immediately, Apple could defer them under US tax law. Hence its anger about being accused of tax dodging: where others see billions in unpaid Irish taxes, Apple and the US government see future US ones. Apple is not, overall, an aggressive tax avoider: it paid $19.1bn in taxes last year.It is not quite so simple, though. Apple has made provisions for deferred US taxes on about half of the $215bn in cash and equivalents it held overseas in 2015. It is waiting for the US tax rate to fall before it repatriates this money to shareholders, but this could be a long time. It may never send back the rest: US companies often reinvest overseas cash in growth or acquisitions.US corporate taxation is especially peculiar and hard to grasp and is painfully dysfunctional. The US government keeps on trying to pass tax reforms, and the details of Apple\u2019s Irish tax structures first emerged publicly during a Senate committee investigation three years ago. The Senate identified US companies\u2019 overseas cash as a tax target for the US not the EU.Enter Ms Vestager, with her plan to make Ireland retrieve \u20ac13bn, and to let other EU countries stake their own claims to the money. Since no one else moved, she gained first mover advantage, and state aid law has given her extraordinary legal powers. It is an audacious, revolutionary and surprising move, but that was Jobs\u2019s style too.Her boldness will change the rules of global taxation if it survives the legal challenges. Bill Gates, Microsoft co-founder, used to get irritated that Apple was hipper than his own company but arguing with public opinion got him nowhere.

A good way to gauge whether a candidate understands the role is to ask what he thinks management is about, and what specifically he would strive to do in managing a particular team. It can also be helpful to ask what other management experiences he has had outside of work: leading an athletic team, a school literary magazine, a squad of volunteers? The candidate may have gained a very useful view of effective management in any of these former roles.

Therefore, your negotiation should be based on a realistic plan of what you can achieve, by when and how. \u2014 Do your homework. Take the time to get to know the organisation in advance \u2014 its business, strategy, values and relevant news. \u2014 Establish your value. Negotiate from a position of power by making it indisputably clear \u2014 through your portfolio or client recommendations, for example \u2014 that you\u2019re at the top of your field. \u2014 Know the value of the work to the organisation.

A few vehicles are parked at a large open space in front of the colony, belonging to people visiting it to offer condolences on the death of a Christian worker killed in Friday\u2019s attack on the neighbourhood. The garrison is located on the banks of the Kabul River, about 30 kilometres northwest of Peshawar, and abuts on the Mohmand and Khyber tribal regions. A bullet-riddled and fading grey gate, with a Pakistani flag fluttering on top, leads to the colony. At the entrance, some policemen are on duty, while to the right of the gate is an empty security checkpost. Adjacent to the post is a large barracks, manned by personnel of the Warsak Security Force (WSF) to provide round-the-clock security to the residents. The colony has four blocks of five houses each, while the fifth block is under construction. Stains of dried blood are still visible at the entrance to the checkpost, while remains of torched motorbikes can be seen in front of the WSF barracks. \u201cSamuel Masih died here,\u201d said a policeman, pointing to the bloodstains. Samuel, a worker at the Peshawar Development Authority (PDA), was on his way to the Hayatabad office when the assailants fired at him just outside the gate. A bleeding Samuel rushed inside and collapsed at the entrance to the post; alerting the guards who proceeded to engage the attackers immediately. The firing from the guards forced the assailants to take cover in the colony\u2019s under-construction block, located to the left of the gate, where three of them blew themselves up after a stand-off with security personnel lasting more than two hours. The fourth attacker scaled the wall and jumped into the house of Farooq Masih, where he too detonated his explosives vest. \u201cWe were asleep when the firing began,\u201d a visibly shaken Farooq said. While the 10 members of his family locked themselves up inside a tiny room, they heard a thud of someone jumping into their courtyard. \u201cWe heard knocks at the door and I thought the time was up for my family,\u201d Farooq said. Luckily for them, however, a door at the other end of the room opened into the backstreet. Farooq and his family managed to make it to the street as bullets flew around them and took shelter inside Mushtaq Masih\u2019s house. They remained there until the security personnel asked them to come out. They were taken to a small church where they remained until the security forces had searched and cleared the compound. Farooq\u2019s two-room house was turned into an assortment of debris after the suicide attacker blew himself up there. Cutlery, two refrigerators, beds, chairs and doors lay scattered while there was a gaping hole in a portion of the wall. \u201cThere were three loud bangs in the under-construction block and the fourth one came from my house,\u201d Farooq said. An attacker torched a motorcycle in Laban Siddiq\u2019s house, next to his house. The walls of the rooms in the construction block, where three of the assailants had detonated their explosives vests, were plastered with blood and human remains. The two rooms were filled with the stench of blood and burnt flesh. Samuel\u2019s brother, Mushtaq Masih, said the slain PDA worker left his home at around 5am and that as soon as he left the firing began. He said he tried to call his brother back amid the sound of intense firing. \u201cIt was after the operation was over that we were informed by security personnel that we had to collect his body from the Combined Military Hospital,\u201d he said. The residents said the Wapda security men and the other security personnel took nearly 30 minutes to reach the colony. \u201cHad the guards not stopped attackers from heading directly for the colony\u2019s streets, the attackers would have slaughtered many, going from one house to another,\u201d said Farooq\u2019s sister, Shaheen. \u201cI thought we were never going to get out of it, but when I heard a man shouting \u2018Naara-i-Takbeer\u2019 and others responding with \u2018Allah-o-Akbar\u2019, I realised that our army had arrived and that the siege was over,\u201d she said. Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Chief Minister Pervez Khattak visited the colony on Saturday. However, the residents were not happy with his gesture. \u201cHe did not bother to look around the colony.

{"1282056": {"date": "Updated September 05, 2016", "article": "Perhaps the most challenging task for provincial authorities is to collect the potential revenue that can be generated from tax on farm incomes. The efforts of successive governments, including the incumbents, have been dismal because of a pattern of family/individual farm ownership and the lack of wherewithal to go about the job in a difficult rural social environment.There is also a strong public opinion that commensurate efforts are not being made to overcome this big challenge because it is not politically convenient for the provincial governments to tax rural gentry. But an enabling environment is being, or has been, created for better taxation of agriculture: digitalisation of land record, proposed enactment of the benami law and a fresh approach outlined in a working paper, released last month, on \u2018unlocking Pakistan\u2019s revenue potential\u2019 written by IMF staffer Serhan Cevik. Yet the provincial governments response to these developments can not be predicted.  Cevik has suggested the introduction of land based tax rates \u2018adjusted according to the productivity characteristics of agricultural lands\u2019 to facilitate better taxation of the agricultural sector \u2018on a progressive scale.\u2019 The IMF expert, however, wants \u2018an appropriate threshold to protect low income farm households\u2019.\nDigitalisation of land records coupled with the enactment of benami law would provide enabling conditions to improve tax revenues from agriculture as the computerisation of records is likely to cripple patwari culture\n\nHis suggestion for levying presumptive taxes on agricultural turnover has come at a time when agribusiness is fast picking up and the number of companies in this segment being registered with the Security and Exchange Commission is increasing at a steady pace. The IMF may claim that the views in the working paper may not necessarily reflect its thinking but the publication of such papers on its website does send soft signals/ideas to the relevant quarters on options they can consider for resolving their outstanding issues. The paper somehow coincides with the FBR\u2019s revision of urban property evaluation tables, pleading for \u2018tax rates adjusted to productivity characteristics of agricultural lands\u2019. Currently landholdings up to 12.5 acres are exempt from taxation. Farmers owning up to 25 acres pay Rs100 per acre. The rate increases to Rs250 for holdings between 26-50 acres and Rs300 for 50 acres. Farmers who own over 50 acres of land, are also required to file for income tax. Earlier international financial institutions had persuaded the provincial governments to digitalise land records with clear title of ownership of farmlands to encourage documentation and more lending by banks. The benami law, likely to be enacted by the end of this year, is designed to unveil the actual owners. According to Serhan Cevik, over 90pc of the farmers \u2018appear\u2019 to have landholdings of less than 12.5 acres, farm income remains largely untaxed and annual tax revenue stands at an average of Rs270 per acre. It may be recalled that ownership of land was dispersed by big farmers to mitigate the effect of landholding ceilings set by Ayub and Bhutto\u2019s land reforms.  Digitalisation of land records, coupled with the enactment of the benami law, would provide enabling conditions to improve tax revenues from agriculture as the computerisation of record is likely to virtually cripple patwari culture.  Yet the major hurdles in taxation of agriculture are unlikely to go away:Ffirst the pattern of individual ownership (personal income is not very tax compliant even in urban areas.) Farmers have neither opted for cooperatives or corporate farming.It is the corporate entities that can be taxed with less difficulty given the will of the government in power. Secondly the provinces, producing a budget surplus with a limited capacity to absorb available funds for development, will not feel the pressure to raise more revenues from agriculture.Their first priority will be to further enhance their revenues from sales tax on services. This is an area where they have outperformed the FBR and tax collection is easier. Adding to that the provincial revenue authorities have not yet been able to shake off much of their lethargy. Finally there is much to do to upgrade overall governance.

This put her in her place.\u201d The SPD, which has ruled the rural state on the Baltic coast with the CDU as junior coalition partners since 2006, won 30.2pc of the vote, down from 35.6pc in the last election in 2011. The CDU won 19.8pc, down from 23pc in 2011, and its worst result ever in the state, the broadcaster said.The far-left Left Party won 12.5pc, down from 18.4pc five years ago, while the pro-environment Greens won 5pc, down from 8.7pc. The far-right NPD was knocked out of the state assembly, falling below the 5pc threshold for the first time since 2006 with 3.2pc, down from 6pc in 2011.Despite losing support, the SPD (24 seats) and the CDU (16) won enough seats to be able to continue their grand coalition in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern with the AfD as the second-largest bloc in the 71-seat state assembly with 18 seats. The SPD, which could also form a coalition with the Left and Green parties, said it was leaving its options open.Voters already punished Merkel in three state elections in March, voting in droves for the AfD and rejecting Merkel\u2019s Christian Democrats.Founded in 2013, the AfD now has won seats in nine of the 16 state assemblies across the country. However, it has no chance of governing in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern since the other parties have said they would not form a coalition with the party. The AfD is also making gains nationwide, a new poll showed on Sunday. If the national election were held next week, the AfD would win 12pc of the vote, making it the third-largest party in Germany, according to a poll conducted by the Emnid institute for the Bild newspaper and published on Sunday.Merkel, mulling a bid for a fourth term as chancellor, made a last-minute campaign appearance on Saturday in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, warning against the politics of \u201cangst\u201d offered by AfD with its virulent anti-refugee stance.Published in Dawn, September 5th, 2016\n", "author": "Reuters", "title": "Anti-immigrant AfD beats Merkel\u2019s party in her home state"}}

The javelin promised fireworks and it delivered \u2013 literally. Organisers of the Berlin event, which forms part of the IAAF World Challenge series of one-day meetings, had installed pyrotechnics for throws beyond the 80-metre mark \u2013 of which there were plenty. In the end, it was a German 1-2-3-4 with Johannes Vetter proving himself the strongest in a superb field. The 23-year-old, who finished fourth at the Rio 2016 Olympic Games last month, secured victory with a personal best 89.57m in his first attempt, with four out of his six attempts sailing beyond the 84-metre mark. Olympic finalist Julian Weber also celebrated a successful day at the office, the 22-year-old finishing second with a personal best 88.29m, while Andreas Hoffmann added a season\u2019s best 85.42m to his tally. Olympic champion Thomas Rohler, who was competing in his fifth competition in seven days, finished in fourth with 82.55m. European 100m hurdles champion Cindy Roleder was equally inspired by the home support. Jasmin Stowers of the US was first out the blocks, but the German clawed her way back into the lead with every hurdle and with a strong second half finished in 12.65 to take the victory from Stowers, who clocked 12.79. Also pushed by the crowd was Gesa-Felicitas Krause. The European champion finished second in the 3000m steeplechase in 9:30.95 behind Celliphine Chespol\u2019s winning time of 9:25.49, while Germany\u2019s Gina Luckenkemper won the women\u2019s 200m in 22.92. David Rudisha was the overwhelming favourite in the men\u2019s 800m and the two-time Olympic champion did not disappoint. Hanging well behind pace maker Bram Som through the 400m, the Dutchman going through the bell in 50.47, Rudisha picked up the pace in the second lap to take the victory in 1:43.31. Minutes after Rudisha\u2019s performance, Caster Semenya once again proved her strength. The South African won in a dominant 1:55.68, just 0.4 away from her PB set when winning in Rio, while Olympic silver medallist Francine Niyonsaba finished second in 1:57.58. Having missed out on a spot in the final in Rio, Kenya\u2019s Eunice Sum finished strongly over the final 50 metres to secure third in 1:57.95. Meanwhile, Great Britain\u2019s David Omoregie emerged as the surprise winner in the men\u2019s 110m hurdles. The 20-year-old got out the blocks well and, with the focus on Pascal Martinot-Lagarde in lane four, Omoregie managed to sneak through unnoticed in lane eight. The Frenchman was even handed the winner\u2019s flowers, only for Omoregie\u2019s name to show on the board as the winner, both being awarded the same time of 13.24 \u2014 a personal best for last year\u2019s European U23 champion. His compatriot Jazmin Sawyers followed suit in the women\u2019s long jump to take the scalp of world and Olympic champion Tianna Bartoletta. The Briton improved throughout the rounds to win with 6.62m. Heptathlete Claudia Rath was celebrating after a final leap of 6.52m moved her into second ahead of Bartoletta, who had to settle for third with 6.49m. Christina Obergfoll, the 2013 world champion in the women\u2019s javelin, celebrated her swansong with a win. The German had finished only eighth at the Olympic Games, but found some measure of redemption here with a fifth-round effort of 64.28m to win over a field that included Croatia\u2019s Olympic champion Sara Kolak. Another evergreen athlete who bid farewell to track and field on Berlin\u2019s blue oval was 2007 double world champion Bernard Lagat. Hanging in the lead pack during the 3000m, the 41-year-old attempted an assault on leader Augustine Choge with 150 metres to go. Choge, who had been struggling with injuries since the IAAF World Indoor Championships Portland 2016 in March, had hinted before the meeting he felt in good shape. In the end, the Kenyan had enough left in the tank to fend off Lagat and take the victory in 7:43.00, with the American finishing second in 7:43.63. Kim Collins shows no signs of slowing down. The 40-year-old wasn\u2019t fully satisfied with his 10.07 winning time in the men\u2019s 100m. Robert Harting, who had the entire discus ring moved to the opposite end of the stadium to benefit from a headwind, couldn\u2019t continue his winning streak in Berlin. Having missed out on the meet last year due to injury, the 2012 Olympic champion threw 63.23m to finish third. Austria\u2019s Lukas Weisshaidinger took the win in a season\u2019s best 66.00m, while Olympic silver medallist Piotr Malachowski came second with 65.39m. In the men\u2019s pole vault, Konstadinos Filippidis defeated the Olympic gold and bronze medallists Thiago Braz da Silva and Sam Kendricks with a first-time clearance over 5.72m, while USA\u2019s Chris Carter took the victory in the triple jump with 17.01m.Published in Dawn September 5th, 2016\n", "author": "Agencies", "title": "German throwers delight home fans at Berlin meet"}}

So, this debate about the constitutionality of court martial of civilian militants is over until the 21st Amendment expires in January 2017. Recently, while deciding 16 appeals regarding the death sentences awarded to 16 civilian militants by the field general court martial (\u2018court martial\u2019), the Supreme Court in the \u2018Said Zaman Khan & Others\u2019 case has now also examined and decided the equally critical issue of whether the actual trials conducted by the court martial of these civilian militants were in accordance with law and justice and especially with the requirements of fair trial. In short, these findings show as discussed below that we live in interesting but dangerous legal times. Silver lining: Although the District Bar Association case upholding the constitutionality of the court martial of civilian militants was disappointing for a section of the public, the silver lining in the verdict was the powerful majority judgement authored by Justice Sheikh Azmat Saeed who laid down two powerful principles. Firstly, \u201ctrials of civilians by court martial are an exception and can never be the rule\u201d. Secondly, the Supreme Court and high court had the judicial power to review any judgement or sentence of court martial. In short, it is the superior courts, and not the chief of army staff or court martial who will have the last and final judicial say. In both, the District Bar Association case and in the recent Said Zaman Khan & Others case, Justice Saeed went further and laid down the following five precise and clear grounds to challenge any judgement or sentence of court martial.\nCan military trials be fair when the accused can\u2019t even engage a civilian lawyer of his choice?\n\nFirstly, the court martial was set up or constituted in violation of the law, and/or the person being tried, and/or the offence for which he is being tried, doesn\u2019t come within the legal jurisdiction or power of court martial. In short, the proceedings are without jurisdiction. Secondly, persons/members forming part of the court martial have delivered the judgement or sentence out of bias or bad faith or ulterior motive. In short, the proceedings are factually mala fide. Thirdly, the judgement or sentence is a wilful act of wrongfulness without reasonable or probable justification and blatantly illegal. In short, the judgement can be challenged on grounds of gross violation of the law without the need to prove actual mala fide intention ie mala fide in law. Fourthly, the judgement or sentence is based on perverse evidence or no evidence or insufficient evidence, or the conclusions drawn are wholly unreasonable and improbable. Fifthly, the decision to select a particular civilian militant to be tried by court martial (as opposed to other similar civilian militants) could also be challenged on the grounds of being unfair and unreasonable.With these five grounds of challenges against court martial judgements, it appeared, at least in theory, that there were powerful legal and judicial safeguards against court martial of civilians. Sadly, in practice this theory has not lived up to expectations.Perfect convictions: An examination of the record of the trial proceedings of the court martial of these 16 persons, all of whom have been given the death sentence, is revealing, perhaps unique in the annals of criminal jurisprudence. Uniquely, the trial record of the 16 in its key aspects is remarkably identical \u2014 perhaps cyclostyle is the right word. Firstly, all 16 persons voluntarily pleaded guilty not once but twice. Secondly, all made judicial confessions before a judicial magistrate and none of them, retracted their confessions later. Thirdly, none of the 16 persons wanted a civil defence lawyer of their choice and preferred to be defended by a defending officer of the armed forces. This is especially surprising considering that they hired lawyers to file petitions before the high court and appeals before the Supreme Court challenging the court martial judgement. Fourthly, the 16 persons did not object to the jurisdiction or members of the court martial. Fifthly, all declined to produce any evidence in their defence. Either this is an example of the \u2018miracles\u2019 of military justice or there is a more earthly reason for such perfect convictions. Presuming the trial record is correct, the main reason for such harmonious military trials, with the accused persons agreeing to everything and anything, is the atmosphere of coercion ie during the trials, the accused persons are in the custody of the military or intelligence and their trials are basically secret. This is obvious from the fact that the relatives of the 16 persons (without exception) found out about the court martial proceedings only after the death sentence was awarded and mainly through newspapers; one family received the news via an anonymous caller. Can such trials be considered fair especially when the accused can\u2019t even engage a civilian lawyer of his choice? I mention this with sadness but with a sense of responsibility that these aspects should have been considered by the Supreme Court especially since all these persons were under death sentences. Even in the darkest days of the Zia era, it was our superior courts that saved numerous people from the unfairness of court martial sentences. Two dangerous legal phenomena are emerging. Firstly, our brave officers and soldiers who have seen their fellow officers and soldiers being killed, often brutally, are as an institution in no position to do dispassionate justice. In such situations, revenge takes precedence over justice. Secondly, the Said Zaman Khan & Others judgement mentions the \u201cextraordinary circumstances necessitating the enactment of the 21st Constitutional Amendment Act\u201d 16 times in the judgement which clearly shows the tremendous responsibility and pressure the courts feel to provide justice against militant violence. But paradoxically, upholding these unfair court martial proceedings leads to the further militarisation of anti-terror law in Pakistan which contains within it the implied acceptance of the failure of the civilian criminal justice system.The writer is a lawyer.Published in Dawn, September 5th, 2016\n", "author": "Faisal Siddiqi", "title": "\u2018Miracles\u2019 of military justice"}}

Mr Mengal said that the CPEC project was only for Punjab. \u201cThe rulers are serving the interest of Punjab and they have no interest in the development of Balochistan.\u201d Out of $46 billion to be spent on the project, even $1bn would not be spent on Balochistan, he claimed. \u201cThis development can be for Mir Hasil Khan Bizenjo and me but it will not benefit people of Balochistan.\u201d He said they could not accept development activities ignoring the province. He paid tribute to the victims of the Aug 8 Quetta massacre and said that the suicide bombing had targeted lawyers who were providing justice to people of the province. After the tragic incident, the rulers and security officials had blamed foreign intelligence agencies for the suicide attack, he said and asked: \u201cIf foreign agencies were involved in the Quetta carnage, who was behind the mass graves unearthed in Tutak? Who was involved in enforced disappearances of the youth whose bodies were recovered from the mass graves? Why has the report about the mass graves not been made public?\u201d The BNP-M leader alleged that Baloch people were being portrayed as traitors and terrorists in the textbooks of Punjab. \u201cWe accept this allegation but want to know the names of those traitors who were responsible for the creation of Bangladesh,\u201d he added. In an apparent reference to MQM-London chief Altaf Hussain, he said that people wanted to know who had \u2018created\u2019 the leaders now raising anti-Pakistan slogans and why action had not been taken against those who resorted to large-scale killings during the visit of former chief justice Iftikhar Chaudhry to Karachi. BNP-M secretary general Dr Jahanzeb Jamaldini said that the land of Jhalawan had rendered great sacrifices for the motherland but rulers wanted it to offer more scarifies. \u201cWe have received around 3,000 bodies of our youths,\u201d he said. \u201cThe youth of Balochistan do not want to die and all they want is to enjoy life like their counterparts in Punjab,\u201d he added. He said why the rulers could not open talks with Baloch people who were demanding their legitimate rights and their control over their resources. \u201cNo one can be allowed to loot and plunder the resources of Balochistan which belong to its people,\u201d Mr Jamaldini said. Former senator Nawabzada Lashkari Raisani alleged that that state institutions were involved in sectarian and targeted killings in the province. Asghar Khan Achakzai, the president of the Awami National Party\u2019s Balochistan chapter, said that Baloch-Pakhtun unity would remain intact. In the past, he added, the alliance between Bacha Khan and Sardar Attaulah Mengal and Mir Ghous Bukhsh Bizenjo was broken by \u2018invisible forces\u2019.

He said there was a beautiful vast pasture known as Jabba half the way to the lake with a stream of crystalline water flowing in a zigzag manner and hundreds of animals grazing. \u201cThere was serenity and natural beauty on the pasture. From there we climbed another rocky hill and reach the lake after covering a three hours distance,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen we reached here we forgot our exasperation and body aches. It is really a heavenly spot where one can find true solace of mind and heart. It is no doubt a dramatic place of peace, serenity and wild beauty,\u201d he added.About the wooden ladder on a steep rock in the middle of the trail to Godar Shehla Anjum, a Pakistani American writer, who lives in Alasaka said, \u201cI think this is the kind of ladder that the Chinese monk Faxian also writes about in his book about his journey, and how he used a ladder to get down to the Indus to cross it, as he made his way toward Uddiyana (Swat). This is an ancient design Faxian used this kind, or a similar ladder, way back in the early 5th century. This is very, very cool,\u201d she told Dawn.

The health department argued that the administrative expenditure was not included in the agreement due to which it could not pay it.Sources told Dawn that the agreement between health department and SRSP had come under scathing criticism from the district health officers (DHOs). The DHOs claimed that they were competent to run the entire district health facilities, therefore, the BHUs should be given to them, they added.Last year, the government extended the contract till 2018 because it believed that the performance of NGO to end collaboration with health dept SRSP-covered BHUs was better than that of others, which were managed by the department itself.Some two months ago, the health department had asked the DHOs to take over the BHUs from SRSP in their respective districts when the latter expressed its inability to run the health facilities. The DHOs were taking over control of BHUs from SRSP but they were stopped, sources said. Sources in SRSP said that PPHI programme was started in 2007 in all provinces by the federal government. The centre paid administrative cost to SRSP in all provinces but stopped it in 2012 and conveyed to the provinces that they should pay the cost if they wanted continuation of the programme.\u201cThe Khyber Pakhtunkhwa chief minister approved a plan to pay administrative cost to SRSP in 2014 but we have not received it yet. We have to maintain 17 offices in as many districts and one head office in Peshawar from where we carry out monitoring and supervision of the facilities and the staff,\u201d they said.These sources said that despite several letters to the health department, there was no reply which meant that it was not interested in continuation of the programme due to which their Board of Governors decided to part ways with it.\u201cFor the last few months, we have been short of budget to pay salaries to the staff engaged in management activities as well as rent of the offices,\u201d they said. Sources in the health department said that the previous government awarded contract to SRSP through a simple agreement without any competition. The government had to follow lengthy procedure for filling up vacant posts, purchase of drugs and equipment and doing repair work due to which the patients suffered, they added.They said that SRSP, being independent of the government\u2019s rules, employed staff and fulfilled the needs without any rules. \u201cWe have now Health Foundation Act in place through which we can advertise to find contracting partners through open bidding.

Blame chemistry and the fact that the batteries we rely on for everyday life are prone to leaking and even bursting into flame if damaged, defective or exposed to excessive heat.That's because lithium-ion batteries store a lot of energy in a tiny space, with combustible components separated by ultra-thin walls. If something happens to those separators, a chemical reaction can quickly escalate out of control.Samsung hasn't specified exactly what caused the fires that led to the recall of 2.5 million Galaxy Note 7s Thursday beyond calling it a \"battery cell issue\".Still, lithium batteries are so ubiquitous that ordinary users of phones and computers shouldn't worry. Research suggests that you're more likely to get hurt by a kitchen grease fire or a drunk driver than the battery powering your iPhone, Kindle or laptop.\"It's not like we live in a world where people's smartphones spontaneously combust,\" said Ramon Llamas, research manager of research firm IDC's mobile phones team. He said owners of Galaxy Note 7s should err on the side of caution and contact Samsung for a replacement that doesn't run the same risk.Here's a look at other notable incidents when lithium batteries by themselves or in electronics have caused problems.On Airplanes\nThere have been dozens of aircraft fires caused by lithium batteries, so many that the batteries are no longer welcome as cargo on passenger flights. In one of the most recent incidents, a Fiji Airways Boeing 737 was preparing for takeoff from Melbourne, Australia, when smoke was discovered coming from the cargo bay. The plane was evacuated and the cargo unloaded. The source of the fire turned out to be lithium-ion batteries in a passenger's checked bags. Hoverboards and e-cigarettes are banned from flights for the same reason.Tesla\nIn August, a Tesla electric car caught fire during a promotional tour in southwest France. Tesla said in a statement that it is \"working with the authorities to establish the facts\" about the fire. The driver was quoted in local newspaper Sud Ouest as saying he answered a Facebook ad offering test drives of the Model S sedan. The driver said he saw smoke, and the three people aboard got out before seeing it catch fire.Tesla hasn't officially found fault with the battery. But in 2013, it faced questions when several Model S sedans caught fire after road debris damaged their batteries. Tesla wound up strengthening the battery shield on new and existing cars.Hoverboards\nHoverboards, or self-balancing scooters, have been linked with at least 99 electrical fires in the U.S., according to the the Consumer Product Safety Commission.Hoverboards might be more susceptible than other products to battery fires because they come under more duress than other electronic devices like computers. Amazon, Best Buy and other retailers dumped the products after videos of burning hoverboards went viral. But they reopened sales this year after passing new fire-safety tests.Computer Batteries\nIn June HP recalled nearly 50,000 HP, Compaq, HP ProBook, HP ENVY, Compaq Presario, and HP Pavilion computers after seven reports of battery packs overheating, melting or charring, including four reports of property damage totaling about $4,000.\n", "author": "AP", "title": "Halt and catch fire: Battery woes go well beyond Samsung"}}

The stand-in captain's 106 in Pallekele and George Bailey's unbeaten 90 in Dambulla helped the visitors register thumping wins in the last two ODIs. The big scores came despite Warner's earlier complaint that he found it \u201chard to gain momentum\u201d on Sri Lanka's sluggish wickets. \u201cIt's a little bit disappointing from our point of view because it's not the way we like to play,\u201d he said, after the series-clinching win in Dambulla. \u201cWe like to play an aggressive brand of cricket. We like to entertain the crowd.\u201d After registering his seventh ODI hundred, Warner said he felt \u201crelieved\u201d. Small wonder, after scratchy scores of eight, one, 10 and 19 in the preceding games. New-look Sri Lanka a work in progress\nA young Sri Lankan side failed to replicate their Test success in the ODI series, faltering against top-ranked Australia time and again. Sri Lanka's spin force was not as effective on helpful home tracks in the absence of Test hero Rangana Herath, who retired from limited-overs cricket after the team's World Twenty20 exit. As for the batting, they relied heavily on Dinesh Chandimal to register respectacle scores. But Sri Lanka's up-and-comers will have learned from their experiences against the reigning ODI world champions.Australia fail Tests but still ODI kings\nAustralia ceded their number one Test ranking after last month's humiliating 3-0 defeat, but they made sure of retaining their ODI crown as they went from strength to strength to clinch the series 4-1. Skipper Steve Smith was rested after the second ODI, but his stand-in, Warner, proved an able replacement. To rub salt into the wound, the Aussies even denied retiring batsman Tillakaratne Dilshan a winning farewell in the third match.Chandimal drives Sri Lankan batting\nWithout Chandimal's contributions with the bat, Sri Lanka's scorecards would have been scant indeed. Chandimal's knocks of 80 not out, 48 and 102 in the first three matches ensured Sri Lanka at least put up a fight against the Aussies. The wicketkeeper-batsman, who was given the added responsibility of leading the side in the final ODI after Angelo Mathews was injured, accumulated 236 runs in the series. Chandimal's failure to get going in the final two matches meant Australia were able to register thumping wins in Dambulla and Pallekele. Bailey, all-rounders star for Aussies\nFormer Twenty20 skipper George Bailey was Australia's batting mainstay in all five games. With some invaluable knocks, Bailey helped Australia through some tense run-chases on the slow Sri Lankan wickets. His unbeaten 90 during the series clincher in Dambulla stood out, but even his small contributions proved vital. He notched up 270 runs in total to earn the man of the series award.  \u201cHe's been innovative, he's been a backbone and (a) rock in the middle,\u201d Warner said of the 33-year-old. All-rounders James Faulkner and John Hastings were also a point of difference for Australia, bowling superbly at pace despite the slow pitches that saw Sri Lankan spinners dominate during the Tests.\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Five things we learned from Sri Lanka v Australia"}}

He accused Saudi Arabia's ruling family, who are the custodians of Islam's holiest sites in Makkah and Madina, of politicising the annual Haj pilgrimage, due to start at the end of the week, turning themselves into \u201csmall and puny Satans who tremble for fear of jeopardising the interests of the Great Satan (the United States)\u201d. For the first time in almost three decades, Iranians have been effectively barred from participating in this year's pilgrimage to Makkah after talks on logistics and security fell apart. But even by recent standards, with relations between the rival Middle Eastern powers at an all-time low, the language was tough. \u201cBecause of Saudi rulers' oppressive behaviour towards God's guests, the world of Islam must fundamentally reconsider the management of the two holy places and the issue of Haj,\u201d Khamenei wrote in a statement on his website. He reserved some of his harshest words for Riyadh's response to a deadly stampede during last year's Haj that killed some 2,300 foreign pilgrims, including an estimated 464 Iranians. \u201cInstead of apology and remorse and judicial prosecution of those who were directly at fault in that horrifying event, Saudi rulers \u2014 with utmost shamelessness and insolence \u2014 refused to allow the formation of an international Islamic fact-finding committee,\u201d he said. Also read: Mina tragedy\u201cThe hesitation and failure to rescue the half-dead and injured people is also obvious and incontrovertible,\u201d he added. \u201cThey murdered them.\u201d 'Blasphemous, faithless'\n As the two leading powers in the Middle East, Iran and Saudi Arabia are at odds over a raft of regional issues, notably the conflicts in Syria and Yemen in which they support opposing sides. Riyadh-Tehran ties were severed for four years after more than 400 people were killed in Makkah during clashes between Iranian pilgrims staging an anti-US protest and Saudi security forces in 1987. Iran is particularly opposed to the Saudi monarchy's close relationship with Washington and Israel. \u201cThe world of Islam, including Muslim governments and peoples, must familiarise themselves with the Saudi rulers and correctly understand their blasphemous, faithless, dependent and materialistic nature,\u201d Khamenei wrote. \u201cThey have placed pilgrims from the participating countries under unprecedented surveillance with the help of the spy agencies of US and the Zionist regime. They have made the divine sanctuary unsafe for everybody,\u201d he charged. In January, relations were severed again after Iranian demonstrators torched Saudi Arabia's embassy and a consulate following the kingdom's execution of a prominent Shia cleric. Some 60,000 Iranians took part in last year's Haj, but it was announced in May that they would not be permitted to take part this year after the two countries failed to agree the Haj memorandum of understanding that is signed annually with more than 70 countries.

tourism boom in one of Hungary\u2019s most impoverished areas.From hammam baths and crumbling minarets to battle site memorials and ruins of mosques, traces of the country\u2019s 150-year-long stretch (1541-1699) in the Ottoman Empire are not hard to find in Hungary.But many Hungarians see them as relics of a dark period during which the country\u2019s flourishing renaissance era was extinguished.As a result, few of the Ottoman monuments have so far been promoted by the Hungarian authorities.Suleiman\u2019s case could change that, however.Experts confirmed in July that excavations begun two years ago in the struggling town of Szigetvar, close to the Croatian border, had revealed the tomb of the 16th-century ruler.Suleiman died aged 71 on Sept 7, 1566, during an epic battle with the mainly Croatian defenders of Szigetvar castle that depleted his forces hoping to quickly advance on Vienna, the capital of the Habsburg Empire.On Wednesday, senior government officials from Hungary, Croatia and Turkey will join thousands of visitors to Szigetvar to commemorate the 450th anniversary of the siege.\u201cThis town is dying, young people are leaving or have already left for Germany or London, but Suleiman can bring in jobs, income, and tourists,\u201d said Norbert Pap, head of the team of researchers whose excavations uncovered the tomb.\u201cSzigetvar may be on the periphery now, but 450 years ago it was on the main street of European history,\u201d Pap, a geographer and historian at nearby Pecs university, told AFP.Wiped from the map Born in 1494, Suleiman, whose reign from 1520 to 1566 was the longest of any sultan, greatly expanded the Ottoman Empire, annexing large swathes of the Balkans, the Middle East and northern Africa.Taken ill before his final battle, Suleiman was found dead in his imperial camp, located an hour\u2019s walk east of the castle, according to contemporary accounts.His body, later removed to Istanbul, was drained of its internal organs and heart, which were buried and later built over by a tomb.While his body was laid to rest in Istanbul, his heart and other internal organs were buried at the site of his death and later covered by a tomb.Around the tomb the town of Turbek grew, the only settlement that the Ottomans built from scratch during their reign in Hungary.At the end of the 17th century, however, both the town and the tomb were wiped off the map by the Habsburgs.Until 2012 that is, when Pap secured funding from the Turkish government to use technology to try find them.A few days before Christmas 2014 a geophysics survey of a site nestled beneath vineyards and orchards four kilometres to the east of Szigetvar castle returned results that set Pap\u2019s pulse racing.\u201cIt showed the presence of buildings, just under the grass, matching positions on the medieval maps of Turbek, and all of them pointing very precisely toward Makkah,\u201d he said.Excavations gradually uncovered the remains of Turbek: the walls of a mosque, a tomb, dervish monastery cloisters, as well as a wealth of silver coins and fragments of clothing, pottery, glass and metal.The evidence became overwhelming, and by July this year experts in Turkey were also convinced.\u201cFinally we could say for certain that we had found Suleiman\u2019s tomb,\u201d said Pap.\u2018National icon\u2019Sleepy Szigetvar with a population of 10,000 has few hotels, but Pap is convinced of the town\u2019s long-term potential for tourism given appropriate investment.The only other Ottoman sultan to die outside the Empire\u2019s centres of Istanbul and Bursa \u2014 Sultan Murad, killed in the 1389 battle of Kosovo Polje \u2014 draws several thousands of tourists annually to his tomb in modern-day Kosovo.\u201cSuleiman is a national cultural icon in Turkey, and as Szigetvar is easier to get to from both western Europe and Turkey than Kosovo, there is a very good chance that Turkish tourists will come visit the tomb,\u201d said Pap.The town\u2019s mayor, Peter Vass, told AFP that he hopes the number of visitors to Szigetvar will double from the current 25,000 per year.The municipality has already earmarked a site for the construction of higher-end hotels close to the castle.As Pap\u2019s team continues to dig for the rest of Turbek including a military barracks and the town\u2019s walls as well as Suleiman\u2019s heart \u2014 buried in a golden urn according to legend \u2014 five Turkish descendants of Ottoman princesses will give DNA samples next week in Szigetvar for comparison with samples from the tomb area.\u201cHungary and Turkey have much in common, a shared cultural heritage,\u201d Turkey\u2019s ambassador in Budapest Sakir Fakili told AFP. \u201cMany Turks are wealthy, and can

Pouille, 22 and ranked 25th in the world, lived up to the promise of his quarter-final run at Wimbledon, emerging from a roller-coaster ride with a 6-1, 2-6, 6-4, 3-6, 7-6 (8-6) triumph over the Spanish superstar. The defeat leaves Nadal \u2014 forced out of the French Open third round with a wrist injury that also saw him miss Wimbledon \u2014 without at least one Grand Slam quarter-final appearance for the first time since he was a teenaged tour newcomer in 2004. Pouille came out firing, pushing Nadal back with an array of deep groundstrokes and angled shots. Fifty-two winners from Nadal \u2014 whose attacking response saw him come out a winner on 35 of 48 forays to the net \u2014 weren\u2019t enough. The taut battle came down to the fifth-set tiebreaker and Nadal, trailing 3-6, showed his mettle by saving three match points \u2014 the third on Pouille\u2019s serve. Then he smacked a forehand into the net to give Pouille one more chance and the French player pounced on it with a blazing forehand that kissed the sideline. \u201cI wanted to take my chance to be very aggressive, try to play with my forehand, and so that\u2019s what I did at the [last] match point,\u201d Pouille said. Nadal acknowledged that his sloppy forehand was \u2018a big mistake\u2019. \u201cBut you are six-all in the tiebreak. I played the right point. I put myself in a position to have the winner and I had the mistake. That\u2019s it. You cannot go crazy thinking about these kinds of things. \u201cThe problem is arriving at six-all in the fifth, I should be winning before,\u201d said Nadal, who opened the fifth set with a break but couldn\u2019t hold onto it, dropping his own serve in the eighth to make it 4-4 and set the stage for the tiebreaker. \u201cI fought until the end,\u201d Nadal said. \u201cThere\u2019s things I could do better, but I had the right attitude. I needed something more \u2014 it was not there.\u201d The four-hour, seven-minute contest entranced the crowd in Arthur Ashe Stadium, where Pouille recalled admiring Nadal as a youngster. Pouille, who has now won three successive five-setters to reach the last eight, wasn\u2019t intimidated by the massive Ashe stage, even though he only practiced on it last year. \u201cI think it was the best atmosphere I played on a center court,\u201d he said of the 22,000-seat cathedral of tennis. \u201cAt the end it was full. Sometimes I couldn\u2019t even hear myself when I was saying \u2018Allez, allez, allez.\u2019\u201d Pouille next tackles 10th-seeded compatriot Gael Monfils, a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 winner over Cypriot Marcos Baghdatis. Ninth-seeded Jo-Wilfried Tsonga also advanced, downing Jack Sock, the last American man left in the draw, 6-3, 6-3, 6-7 (7-9), 6-2. It\u2019s the first time since 1947 that three French men have reached the quarter-finals of one Grand Slam. The 23-year-old Sock, seeded 26th, hadn\u2019t faced a break point in surprising 2014 champion Marin Cilic in the third round. Against Tsonga he mustered only five aces and was broken six times by the 2008 Australian Open runner-up, who has reached at least the semi-finals of every Grand Slam except this one. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tRAFAEL Nadal reacts after a tie-break miss to Lucas Pouille.\u2014Reuters\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTsonga next faces world No 1 and defending champion Novak Djokovic, who powered past 84th-ranked Kyle Edmund of Britain 6-2, 6-1, 6-4. Edmund looked thoroughly out-classed until he managed to put together a run of three straight games in the third set that included two breaks of Djokovic\u2019s serve. But the Serb star, who received on-court treatment on his right arm \u2014 just as he did in the first round against Jerzy Janowicz \u2014 regrouped quickly and closed out the match by breaking Edmund at love. \u201cFeels great to play a full match after a weird couple of days when I didn\u2019t have too much tennis,\u201d said Djokovic, who was handed a walkover into the third round by injured Czech Jiri Vesely and played just six games before third round opponent Mikhail Youzhny retired hurt. Meanwhile, Caroline Wozniacki, derailed this year by an ankle injury which sent her career into a tailspin, and Anastasija Sevastova, who quit the sport three years ago, set up a women\u2019s singles quarter-final duel. Former world No 1 Wozniacki, the runner-up in 2009 and 2014, downed American eighth seed Madison Keys 6-3, 6-4 to make the last-eight in New York for a fifth time. Sevastova became the first Latvian woman in 22 years to reach a Grand Slam quarter-final when she beat British 13th seed Johanna Konta 6-4, 7-5. The other quarter-final in the bottom half of the draw sees German second seed Angelique Kerber face Roberta Vinci, the Italian seventh seed. Kerber defeated Petra Kvitova 6-3, 7-5 while Vinci enjoyed a 7-6 (7-5), 6-2 win over Lesia Tsurenko of Ukraine. Now ranked at 74 in the world after a right ankle injury sidelined her for almost three months, Wozniacki hit just seven unforced errors in her win over Keys. Wozniacki is back in the last-eight of a Slam for the first time since making the semi-finals in New York in 2014. \u201cAfter such a tough year, it\u2019s amazing to be in the quarter-finals,\u201d said the 26-year-old whose Grand Slam record this year had seen first round losses in Australia and Wimbledon while she sat out Roland Garros. Sevastova, the 26-year-old world No 48, knocked out French Open champion and third seed Garbine Muguruza in the second round and she built on that victory on Arthur Ashe Stadium in a last 16 tie which featured 12 breaks of serve. Larisa Savchenko was the last Latvian woman to make the quarter-finals of a Slam at Wimbledon in 1994. Sevastova had not won a match in New York since 2010 before this year and with her career unravelling she quit in May 2013 to study leisure management in Austria. Konta, bidding to become the first British woman in the quarter-finals since Jo Durie in 1983, never recovered from a poor start. A semi-finalist at the Australian Open in January, the 25-year-old was 3-0 down in the first set and 4-1 behind in the second. She managed to save a match point in the ninth game of the second set but Sevastova held her nerve to secure victory after 1 hour and 42 minutes, Wozniacki defeated Sevastova in their only previous meeting, in straight sets in the Australian Open last 16 in 2011.

{"1282266": {"date": "September 06, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe writer is currently a public policy fellow at the Woodrow Wilson Centre, Washington DC.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nTHE US has recently decided to cut both military and economic aid to Pakistan sharply, which is a welcome move for both countries. The US has domestic political imperatives and its foreign policy priorities are changing. Pakistan has to get out of the vastly exaggerated, but perceptually well-entrenched, \u2018aid dependence syndrome\u2019. Pakistan would be well advised to take a fresh look at the nature of its future strategic relationship and reorient its ties with the US. The 21st century is going to be marked by a dramatic shift from an industrial economy to one that is knowledge-based. The planning commission\u2019s Vision 2025 recognises this and incorporates \u2018knowledge economy\u2019 as one of its seven pillars. How far this can practically be achieved in the next decade will depend upon the foundations on which this pillar is erected, ie the quantity and quality of scientific and technological manpower. We lag behind other peer countries and have a lot of catching up to do.  Asian countries are continuously engaged in expanding their scientific workforce and research and development expenditures. Chinese and Korean scientists, returning to their native countries from the US, are leading the efforts for developing domestic innovation capacity. China is now able to perform nearly as much of the world\u2019s high-tech manufacturing as the US because of its deployment of hundreds of thousands of US-trained local professionals. Patents filed by Korean scientists are reported to be among the highest in the OECD countries. The annual flow of Chinese students to foreign universities for tertiary education is 459,800, of which the US alone receives in excess of 100,000. \nFor Vision 2025 to succeed in producing a knowledge economy, Pakistan must invest more in STEM learning.\n\nIndia is closely following China\u2019s example and is the second-largest supplier of foreign students to the US. Out of 132,000 Indian students enrolled in the US, 80 per cent are studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) subjects. The number of faculty members and research scientists of Indian origin working in the US is approximately one million, having grown by 85pc from 2003 to 2013. They account for 3.3pc of the US research force, compared to 2.5pc a decade ago. The governments of the US and India have established the US-India Science and Technology Endowment Fund for the promotion of joint activities that would lead to innovation and entrepreneurship through the application of science and technology. A study by the Kaufman Foundation shows that, although the number of immigrant-founded start-ups in Silicon Valley has fallen from 52.4pc to 43.9pc since 2005, the number of start-ups founded by Indians has actually climbed from 26pc to 33pc of all immigrant start-ups, or 15pc of the total.Why is the US still the preferred country for science and technology professionals? Among the world\u2019s top 40 universities, two-thirds are in the US. Technology companies founded less than two decades ago feature among the top 10 companies of the world. Of Nobel Prize winners, 356 out of 870 have been Americans (the highest of any nation) \u2014 but 70pc of all Nobel Prize winners work in the US. Forty per cent of the world\u2019s total spending on science and research is accounted for by the US. All cutting-edge research and application development in the areas of artificial intelligence, robotics, lasers, sensors, avionics, biotechnology and genetics is being carried out in this country. MIT and Stanford alumni companies generate annual revenues of $4.9 trillion and have created 8.4m jobs since 1930. The National Science Foundation reported that in 2010, 45pc of US engineering students in MSc and PhD programmes were from overseas. According to a study by RAND, \u201cthe inflow of foreign students, scientists and engineers have been a key factor that has enabled the US science and engineering workforce to grow faster than the US is graduating native-born scientists and engineers\u201d. These foreign-born scientists then establish collaborative projects in their own countries of origin, disseminate the latest knowledge by lecturing at universities, setting up research laboratories, or guiding and recruiting students for advanced degree programmes in the US.Asian countries are taking full advantage of training their scientific manpower, but it is highly disturbing to observe the declining proportion of Pakistani students enrolled in US universities. In 1989-90, Pakistani students in the US numbered 7,070 compared to those from India at 26,240 \u2014 one Pakistani for every four Indians. By 1999-2000, the disparity increased to a ratio of 1:7 \u2014 but an even greater precipitous fall has taken place since then. In 2014-15, Indian students had reached 132,888 while Pakistani students were only 5,354 \u2014 yielding a ratio of 1:25.It may be recalled here that the ratio of population between these two countries is 1:7. Even Nepal, with a population of 28m or about one-sixth of Pakistan, had 8,158 students \u2014 almost 50pc higher than the number of Pakistani students. As Pakistan does not even figure among the top 25 countries sending their students to the US, it is not possible to identify the fields of their study. A cursory glance at the Fulbright Scholar Programme for Pakistan \u2014 professedly the largest US programme in the world \u2014 shows that the majority do not go for STEM subjects or attend top universities, and very few go for PhD degrees. The HEC\u2019s foreign PhD scholarship programme was also targeted mainly at non-US institutions, comparable neither in academic rigour, relevance nor quality. Many of these scholars, upon return, are unable to provide the necessary guidance to their MPhil and PhD students. The recent decision by the minister of planning and development to send 10,000 Pakistanis to study in the US for PhD degrees, though welcome, should benefit from this empirical data and seek to ensure that pitfalls of the recent past are avoided, the examples of other Asian countries are followed, and the foundation for a robust scientific infrastructure to compete in the knowledge economy is laid out.In brief, increase the flow of students to the US, award scholarships mainly for STEM subjects at top universities and institutes, enable successful scholars to acquire applicative experiences in the US, and open up our universities and research establishments to provide a conducive work environment for the returning scholars. This expanded pool of Pakistani scientists in the US and Pakistan will provide the foundation for the pillar envisaged in Vision 2025.

After having failed to create premonitions and misgivings in the recent past about construction of two coastal nuclear power stations near Karachi \u2014 Kanupp-2 and Kanupp-3 \u2014 the anti-nuclear lobby has once again launched a tirade against the project. The project has already suffered significant delays owing to people having vested interests trying to giving it a controversial twist.The Pakistan Nuclear Regulatory Authority (PNRA), an independent body which follows best practices and international standards, has approved the preliminary safety analysis report (PSAR) related to the project, following national and international parameters taking into consideration all consequences and public health safety considerations, and fully associating the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA).It is safe, cost-effective, reliable, sustainable, continuous base-load power, more economical and efficient. It has no emission of greenhouse gases.After a short pause since Fukushima-Daiichi plant disaster in 2011, Japan is returning to nuclear power generation. As a policy, Sendai nuclear power plant in southern Japan has re-started its operations under new safety rules, while approval to re-start another four reactors in Japan, in the first phase, has also been given. The Japanese government has plans to bring the share of nuclear power generation in total energy mix to about 22pc by 2030.On the other hand, there are 21 reactors in operation in India with an installed capacity of 5,302 MW, whereas another 4,300 MW nuclear power generation capacity would be added this year. Also, India plans to construct additional 35 reactors by 2024 countrywide with a total capacity of about 40,000 MW.Intriguingly, most of these installations or projects are not covered under IAEA safeguards. As nuclear radiation/ contamination know no borders, population in Pakistan also remains at risk in case a nuclear accident occurs in India. Nonetheless, nothing is said in Pakistan about the possible danger.The writers have ignored that our country has an impeccable record of safety in operating nuclear power plants since 1972 under safeguards of the IAEA that has repeatedly shown satisfaction over safety measures, whereas Pakistan is party to the Convention on Nuclear Safety and to two international conventions for early notification and assistance.Opponents to Pakistan\u2019s nuclear energy programme having repeated discourses on its possible negative impact on environment simply ignore the fact that waste produced by coal-based power plants is more radioactive than that generated by nuclear power plants. The nation keenly looks forward to the completion of Kanupp-2 and Kanupp-3 in the wake of massive power loadshedding and the ever-increasing cost of energy. Apparently, vested interests would like to deprive the nation of affordable and sustained electricity.Hussain SiddiquiIslamabadPublished in Dawn September 6th, 2016\n", "author": "From the Newspaper", "title": "Nuclear energy"}}

Images of the political heavyweights smiling and shaking hands were shared widely online, highlighting the political flux caused by outrage over scandal-tainted Prime Minister Najib Razak.Najib is accused of involvement in looting billions of dollars in state money. He denies the charge and has cracked down in response. Mahathir, who imposed his will on Malaysia for 22 years as prime minister before retiring in 2003, has led calls for Najib\u2019s arrest.Any potential rapprochement between the cagey Mahathir and the charismatic Anwar \u2014 whose rivalry continues to reverberate in Malaysian politics \u2014 could be a game-changer.Anwar was heir apparent to Mahathir until he was sacked in 1998 by his boss over political differences, an episode that deeply divided the country.Charged with sodomy and corruption, Anwar was jailed six years, but emerged to revitalise the previously ineffectual opposition until he was jailed again in 2015 by Najib\u2019s government.\u201cI don\u2019t know about friends, but I know I talked to him,\u201d Mahathir said, chuckling, when reporters asked after the encounter whether the two were friendly again. \u201cI met him and had a long chat with him about what he was doing,\u201d he added, while denying they had \u201cmade peace.\u201d Mahathir said he was merely showing support for a legal challenge launched by Anwar against a draconian new security law rammed through last year by Najib.\u201cNow I think I have seen everything,\u201d Eric Paulsen of activist group Lawyers for Liberty said in tweeting an image of the handshake.It remains to be seen whether a politically significant dtente can be achieved given the baggage between the two men.The formidable opposition alliance that Anwar forged has crumbled amid infighting since his jailing.Najib, meanwhile, has tightened his grip on the country and used the powerful ruling coalition\u2019s deep pockets and pervasive control to win recent by-elections.The next general election must be held by mid-2018.However, leading independent pollster Ibrahim Suffian called the handshake \u201ca big deal\u201d and a potentially significant sign that Mahathir was ready to link up with the opposition he once fiercely battled.Published in Dawn September 6th, 2016\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Malaysia abuzz as old foes Mahathir, Anwar join hands"}}

The document, posted recently on a US government website, explains why during his visit to India last week Secretary of State John Kerry rejected the suggestion, made at media briefings and public engagements, that Washington needed to abandon Pakistan as it was not a trustworthy ally. In his first comment, however, Secretary Kerry advised Pakistan not to make distinctions between \u201cgood terrorists\u201d and \u201cbad terrorists\u201d, though in a later statement he said that Pakistan itself had been a victim of terrorism and lost over 50,000 people to violent acts.

The document explains that non-security US assistance to Pakistan supports development, cooperation and reform in five key areas: energy, economic growth, stabilisation of areas most vulnerable to extremism, education and health.

The draft doctrine is being reviewed at different levels in the navy and government ahead of adoption. Senior Research Fellow of Pakistan Navy War College and author of the doctrine retired Commander Muhammad Azam Khan, speaking at the Centre for International Strategic Studies (CISS), said the doctrine aimed at developing coherence and uniformity of thought and action within Pakistan Navy and promoting cooperation with Army, Air Force, allied navies and coalition partners. He said the doctrine would further give contextual clarity to all stakeholders and observers of maritime developments in Pakistan. Cdr Khan gave an overview of the doctrine and said its formulation had been necessitated by the evolving threat matrix and maritime environment in the IOR. \u201cWith the regional environment of IOR being marred by uncertainty and political instability, Pakistan has to maintain its maritime security, be cognisant of its security interests and put forth its doctrinal assumptions based on concepts governing application of maritime forces, the command and control structures and a carefully crafted role for its naval forces,\u201d he said. Besides the security element and development of better ties with allied navies, the doctrine also envisages protection of shipping and commercial interests and addressing issues like climate change and rise of sea level.

The students who displayed their work are: Rhuma Khan, Tayyaba Bilal, Adil Akram, Zubair Baig, Muqaddas Shehzad Hussain and Muhammad Riaz .Some over 100 artworks by faculty and students such as drawings, paintings, miniature, ceramics, sculptures and calligraphy had a lot to offer in terms of technique and ideas. Mr Jalal held the efforts of students in high esteem and said that the artworks on display were so matured that if one didn\u2019t tell one could not guess that it was student\u2019s work.The exhibition will remain on for about a week.\n\n\n\nAnother exhibition of artworks ( paintings) by Sara Riaz Khan opened at Rohtas-2 Art Gallery, Model Town, on Monday. She said about her works that in the series, there was a sense of movement through spaces which parallel both inner and outer worlds. \u201cI\u2019ve enjoyed the challenges of working on a large scale and want to continue exploring different ways of mark marking, creating structure and expressing concepts,\u201d she said.She said she felt closely connected to nature and was interested in ideas which brought people together. Colours excite the artist and Ms Khan mainly uses oil and gesso to stain and mark the canvas, building up texture and depth. Using paint more thickly in places allows the artist to scratch back and reclaim earlier layers of colour.Rohtas-2 Art Gallery\u2019s Saleema Hashmi said that the work was very meditative and inspired by journeys and experiences a very thoughtful one. \u201cOne don\u2019t realise how many layers are part of the work, it\u2019s very poetic and unusual work and less artists do such paintings,\u201d she said of the work. The exhibition will run till September 17.Published in Dawn, September 6th, 2016\n", "author": "Shoaib Ahmed", "title": "Theses of Naqsh School of Arts on display"}}

The SSP said parking stands at the railway station were evacuated and fenced in with barbed wire and that all entry points except two main entrances were closed. He said every one entering the station was to be body searched.He added that serious threats had been made against other sensitive government buildings in the garrison city as well.\u201cWe cannot take chances and we are taking all possible measures for ensuring the railway station and other sensitive buildings are secure and protected,\u201d he said, adding that Elite Force commandoes have also been called in to assist in ensuring the safety of the public.According to another police official, security measures were also tightened in the Cantonment areas after the terror threats were made. He said well equipped army personnel were deployed to patrol around sensitive government buildings.According to railway authorities and the police, the train services will not be suspended on Tuesday, though the metro bus service will be suspended on September 6 due to the National Defence Day Celebrations.Due to the celebrations and rehearsals for them, residents of some parts of Rawalpindi and Islamabad were left without cellular reception as signals were suspended and services may also be suspended on Tuesday.Text messages sent by cellular service providers said that as per directions from the Pakistan Telecommunication Authority (PTA) service will be suspended from 4pm to 11 pm on September 5 in the General Headquarters (GHQ) and its surrounding areas.Meanwhile, messages by internet service providers said that according to PTA directions, internet service may be unavailable due to security reasons till 11pm on Monday and from 4pm to 11pm on Tuesday.Every year on Defence Day, the chief of army staff gives a speech, the guard of honour is given and war heroes are remembered.

They said most of the primary and secondary care hospitals were devoid of basic requirements and facilities while absence of electricity was a problem common to all hospitals due to which X-ray machines remained non-functional and the patients had to go to the district headquarters hospital for seeking treatment. On the occasion, district health officer Javaid Ahmed said the development platform launched a few months ago in the two union councils of Drosh, had made headway in creating awareness about health and hygiene among the people. The participants highlighted the issues facing the health sector with special reference to Drosh town. They termed the chain of district platforms and roundtable conferences as helpful in discussing the health issues and suggesting solutions to them.They lamented that the allocation of budget for tehsil headquarters hospitals was not made proportionate to the strength of patients attended. They said hospital of Drosh had a record strength of 85,000 outdoor patients, while that of Booni had only 9,000, Garam Chashma 8,000 and Torkhow less than 6,000, but the annual budget allocation was equal for all these hospitals. They said Drosh hospital also faced the burden of patients coming from the Kunar province of Afghanistan via Arandu border, while five different valleys of Sheshi Koh, Jinjirat Kosh, Beori, Ursoon and Ashrait were also covered by this hospital.

However, instead of a car, the service offers transport on a motorbike, which makes it extremely affordable.\nRun via smartphone apps, CARGAR and Careem offer speedy, affordable transport\n\nThe application caters specifically to students such as Sohail Ahmed, 18, who says he cannot afford a taxi and cannot travel on public transport on days that his father is not available to drop him off at his college.\u201cWhen my father is not in the city, I have to hire a taxi and pay between Rs250 and Rs350 to get from I-10 to H-8,\u201d he said. But using the CARGAR service is cheaper and faster.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPhoto courtesy: Facebook\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nCARGAR CEO and co-founder Faran Ahmed said he graduated from Nust this June and launched the mobile app soon after.\u201cI graduated from a good university but there still weren\u2019t many options when it came to jobs and a number of my classmates are still struggling to find work. I thought I should start a business of my own and within a few months, I could provide jobs for 18 people,\u201d he said.Talking about the application, Mr Ahmed said he conceived the idea for a motorbike taxi from a visit to Indonesia, where most people prefer riding a motorbike cab as they are more affordable and speedy, even during a traffic jam.\u201cThe motorbike taxi can be called through the application and customers have to pay Rs20 service charges and Rs15 per kilometre. A helmet, rain coat and a portable battery for charging mobile phones will also be provided,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nMr Ahmed said he expects business to improve after the summer vacations when students will need affordable transport to get to schools and colleges. He said the service is currently limited to H-11 and H-12 and that it will soon be offered across the city.\u201cAll our drivers have licenses and customers will be asked to rate their journeys so every driver has a rating. We are always offering part time jobs,\u2019 he said.The young entrepreneur said he is also considering hiring women drivers to cater to women customers.Another transport service that is run via mobile app is Careem, the ride-sharing service modelled on the style of Uber. Using satellite maps, just like the CARGAR app, the service is able to provide a taxi service right at the commuter\u2019s doorstep. In addition, an accurate destination calculator also gives the user an estimate of the total fare before one books a ride. \u201cNo longer are we forced to hail taxis on the roads; you just install the app and a car will show up at your doorstep.

We have made it clear that invoking of section 124(A) of IPC (sedition) requires certain guidelines to be followed as per the earlier judgement of the apex court,\u201d an Indian Supreme Court bench said on Monday, while disposing of a petition filed by a non-governmental organisation alleging misuse of the sedition law, .At least two high-profile sedition cases were filed against the India chapter of Amnesty International (AI) and Ramya, an Indian celebrity, last month. Amnesty had hosted an event on India-held Kashmir (IHK), where someone allegedly chanted slogans for the freedom of Kashmir, whereas Ramya had disagreed with Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar\u2019s description of Pakistan as \u201chell\u201d saying: \u201cI respectfully disagree, but Pakistan is not hell.\u201d Explore: Sacred geography: Why Hindus, Buddhist, Jains, Sikhs should object to Pakistan being called hellEarlier, sedition cases against Bollywood superstar Amir Khan and several Kashmiri students also made headlines in international media.

It\u2019s already there in the five-judge constitution bench judgment in Kedar Nath Singh vs state of Bihar of 1962.\u201d\u201cYou have to file separate plea highlighting if any misuse of sedition law is there.

{"1282446": {"date": "Updated September 07, 2016", "article": "On a recent visit to the mountain resort of Nathia Gali in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), I clambered up the narrow and steep path to the Lalazaar Wildlife Park to revisit the snow leopard being kept in captivity there. I was attending a workshop on climate change organised by the Heinrich Boll Foundation based in Islamabad with a group of journalists interested in environmental reporting. The last time I was there in 2012, I wrote a blog piece \"Snow Leopard in a Birdcage\" in which I had criticised the local wildlife department for not feeding the snow leopard properly and for housing it in a small enclosure meant for pheasants, causing injury to the animal.I had hoped things would change for the better for the male snow leopard named Sohni or Sundar. Promises were made of shifting him to a larger, purpose-built enclosure and there was plenty of talk of money being allocated for it by the provincial government.Four years on, the only thing that had improved for Sohni was that his birdcage had grown in size. He looked bored but otherwise healthy as he sat atop his shed looking at us lazily in the cool, summer evening. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tSohni has been living in a birdcage for the past six years. Photo provided by the author\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe sun was setting yet hundreds of tourists were still trekking up to Lalazaar. But not everyone was happy about what they saw. One lady, who had brought her three children to see Sohni, was disappointed after finding out that the snow leopard was kept in such cramped conditions. She didn't think it was worth trekking up and told me her children felt really bad for Sohni.    Sohni's past is certainly more colourful than his present. Shahbaz Sharif\u2019s eldest son, Hamza Sharif, allegedly acquired the snow leopard cub from a source in Central Asia illegally. The Convention on the International Trade against Endangered Species, to which Pakistan is a signatory, bans the trade of endangered animals. Sharif kept the cub in his house for six months in nearby Doonga Gali, where it was reportedly taken care of and fed well.But six years ago, WWF-Pakistan learnt about Sohni being kept in illegal captivity and approached Sharif, convincing him to hand the animal over to a local zoo to avoid bad publicity. This is how Sohni ended up in the Lalazar Wildlife Park.I had hoped that the environmentally inclined Pakistan Tehreek-i-Insaf (PTI) government would do more for Sohni after coming to power in the 2013. But so far, there has not been any action taken to improve his lot. As one friend recently quipped, \u201cperhaps you should tell the PTI that it\u2019s a political defection from the Noon League and they might do something about it!\u201d Experts say that only around 3,500 to 7,000 wild snow leopards remain in the mountain regions of Central Asia, including the 200 or so in the mountain ranges of Pakistan. In addition, there are between 600 and 700 snow leopards in zoos around the world. In Pakistan, there are currently two snow leopards in captivity: Sohni and a female snow leopard Lovely, also known as Lolly, in Gilgit-Baltistan (GB). Lovely was found in December 2012 by local villagers in the nearby Khunjerab National Park after being abandoned by her mother. The villagers say the injured six-month-old cub was deserted by her mother when the cub failed to cross a river in Khunjerab with her. Snow leopard cubs cannot survive in the wild once taken from their mothers because it is their mothers who teach them how to hunt. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLovely, also called Lolly, in her cage in Sust, near the Khunjerab National Park. Photo provided by the author\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe wildlife department of GB was alerted by the villagers and the cub was moved to a rehabilitation centre in Sust, the closest town near the Khunjerab National Park.The centre has a small wire mesh cage with a flimsy notice put up by the Park and Wildlife Division Hunza-Nagar, urging visitors not to give the animal \u201cany food or other items without the prior permission of the wildlife authority\u201d. Unfortunately, the snow leopard was treated so poorly in the last few years that she currently suffers from malnutrition and sits listlessly in her cage, barely switching her tail.Dr Ali Nawaz of the Snow Leopard Foundation in Pakistan has been actively trying to do something positive for Lovely. The organisation has designed and raised funds to construct a purpose-built enclosure for her up in the picturesque Naltar valley, which should be open to public soon. He told me that by the end of August this year, they would be shifting the female snow leopard to the enclosure, which they have designed in accordance with international standards. They will then hand the centre over to the GB government to run it.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tLovely will soon be moving into her new home. Photo provided by the author\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWhile Lovely has a bright future, what about poor Sohni stuck in Lalazaar? So far, Dr Nawaz has not been asked to develop a new enclosure for Sohni but he is ready to provide technical support should the government ask. Every winter when it snows in Nathia Gali, Sohni is sent down to Abbottabad. Dr Nawaz told me that it must be stressful for the animal. He said it would be better to shift the snow leopard to its natural habitat.As for any suggestion to house both Sohni and Lovely in the same enclosure in order to encourage breeding, Dr Nawaz is against such a proposition. They can barely take care of these two \u2014 imagine the headache if there were more.Photos are by the author.\n", "author": "Rina Saeed Khan", "title": "Sohni and Lovely \u2500 The two snow leopards in captivity in Pakistan"}}
{"1282456": {"date": "September 07, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe writer is an attorney teaching constitutional law and political philosophy.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWHEN he was about 22 years, Ibn Battuta set out from his home in Tangier for Makkah. The year of his departure was 1325 and, according to records, Ibn Battuta travelled for much of his life and performed Haj five times. Several hundred years hence, the wonders of jet travel have made the journey to Saudi Arabia and consequently Makkah a less legendary act, one that is no longer limited to intrepid explorers.In Pakistan, travellers to the kingdom are of two major types, those in search of livelihood and those in search of salvation. In the present season, it is the latter that dominate, their white garments marking them as the devout bound on the journey of a lifetime, their lips forming words of prayer. Those who have not undertaken the journey look upon them longingly, wishing it was they who were going. The other kinds of travellers who make their way to Saudi Arabia are not usually the envy of their peers. These are the tens of thousands of workers whom Pakistan sends to Saudi Arabia every year. They carry different loads, rolled-up bedding and battered suitcases \u2014 and, crucially, the responsibilities of large families that await their paychecks. \nSaudi Arabia\u2019s sovereignty over what is holy to all Muslims appears far more real than the concept of an ummah.\n\nAs newspaper reports have detailed in the past several months, about 9,000 of these men working in Eastern Saudi Arabia have not been paid by their employers and remain stranded in that country. Reportedly, the largest employers that have reneged on payment are Saudi Oger, Al Khobar and M/S Saad Trading. Sometime ago, the government of Pakistan took notice of the situation and approached the Saudi government for resolution of the matter. In the meantime, the prime minister ordered that families of the workers be provided Rs50,000 each, with Rs210 million from the Baitul Maal reserved for this purpose. The government of Pakistan, however, can only do so much. It is difficult to prevail against the intransigence and arrogance of Saudi employers. The Pakistani workers demanding their wages outside the gates of these big Saudi corporations can testify to their hard-heartedness and to the hopelessness that pervades their lives. So acute is the despair that confronts these workers, that one of them, a middle-aged father of four, reportedly committed suicide recently. According to his brother, the family had taken out a loan of Rs250,000 to send him to work in the kingdom. As the possibility of getting paid grew dim, the weight of the unpaid loan loomed large. He was found hanging from the ceiling of his room in Al Abwa, Saudi Arabia.On the other side are the Pakistani pilgrims; among them many who have saved all their lives to fulfil the religious obligation. Eager as ever, they pile onto planes and head out to the very kingdom where other Pakistanis ache to be paid and yearn to leave. Planeloads of them arrive in Saudi Arabia in the days prior to Haj, their arrival, visas and documentation all duly vetted by a Saudi regime that makes millions every year from the pilgrimage. The vast engine of Haj, the cleaning of spaces, the moving of people, the feeding of so many hundreds of thousands is accomplished by workers from elsewhere, Bangladeshis and Pakistanis and many others. Haj is a religious imperative, seen as a route to spiritual salvation. Regardless of where they come from, pilgrims arrive with the hope of seeing a holy place they have turned towards five times a day for their entire lives. The fact that such holy places are located on Saudi territory means that admission and entry are dependent on the Saudis. As can be seen by the restrictions on Iranian pilgrims this year, the Saudi government does not hesitate to use this reality as a means of imposing a cost on pilgrims when their governments refuse to tow the line of Saudi intentions in international relations. It is in this last sense \u2014 the simultaneous identity of Saudi Arabia as a nation state with strategic interests and an agenda, and as home to the holiest sites in Islam \u2014 that a conundrum arises. Even those Muslim pilgrims that oppose Saudi Arabia\u2019s actions as a nation state \u2014 the bombing of Yemen, for instance, or the non-payment of wages to Pakistanis and others \u2014 are forced into a sort of compliance by Saudi sovereignty over the pilgrimage sites. Because of this, even a poor father whose son has awaited wages for his labour for many months, still longs to visit the holy sites and complete the pilgrimage, even as that wish lies in the domain of those who have so wronged his son. In a sense then, a Muslim anywhere in the Muslim world is forced into silence when it comes to Saudi wrongdoings because he or she does not wish to jeopardise the possibility of performing the pilgrimage. The nation state did not exist during the time of the Holy Prophet (PBUH) when Haj became one of the five pillars of Islam. It exists now, and the divisions, the separate camps and arrangements made for arriving pilgrims, are visible everywhere during the pilgrimage. The imagined ummah, a vast united mass that would be drawn together by faith, is in this sense not an accurate description of many aspects of the occasion or of how people are divided and moved. The Saudi nation state, its sovereignty over what is holy to all Muslims, appears far more real and dominant than the concept of an ummah. The individual Pakistani pilgrim is largely powerless over many of these realities but he or she should not forget them. If it is spiritual mindfulness that is the purpose of pilgrimage then some may also be motivated to alleviate in whatever small way possible, the suffering of families of Pakistani workers who wait for their wages and justice from their Saudi bosses.

{"1282496": {"date": "September 07, 2016", "article": "DURING an international seminar organised by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS) to commemorate its 45th anniversary last week, the Indonesian ambassador to the UK and former CSIS executive director, Rizal Sukma, posed one of the pertinent strategic questions of the day: can Asean maintain its centrality without unity?He raised the question in light of criticisms that Asean, Association of Southeast Asian Nations, has been unable to act as one in dealing with China in the South China Sea. We witnessed this disunity play out in Cambodia in 2012 and almost saw its repetition in Vientiane two months ago if it hadn\u2019t been for the hard work of Indonesian Foreign Minister Retno LP Marsudi and her team.The question of \u201ccentrality without unity\u201d nevertheless remains pertinent, not just for Jakarta, but for the wider Indo-Pacific region as well. After all, for better or worse, Asean \u2014 along with its offspring institutions like the Asean Regional Forum (ARF), the Asean Defence Ministers Meeting Plus (ADMM Plus) and the East Asia Summit (EAS) \u2014 remains the only all-inclusive cornerstone of a burgeoning regional order.Of course, like all important strategic questions, there are no easy, clear-cut answers; at least none that would please everyone. But to move the conversation productively forward, let\u2019s be clear on what Asean centrality is and is not.Despite claims to the contrary, centrality is not interchangeable with or equivalent to consensus. In fact, consensus is only one of the preconditions for, or pathways toward, centrality.As defined by the Asean Charter, centrality is the notion that Asean should be the \u201cprimary driving force\u201d in shaping the group\u2019s external relations in a regional architecture that is open, transparent and inclusive (Article 1).Centrality is therefore not an outcome, or some end-state to run toward.It is the run itself \u2014 an ongoing process of continuous engagements with external partners. In other words, it is not a question of whether Asean is central, but to what extent and how.It should also be noted that consensus does not always imply unanimity of position (as reflected in joint statements). Sometimes consensus can be an agreement to disagree \u2014 not necessarily a stark choice between \u201cagree on all words\u201d or \u201cno statement at all\u201d.After all, not only did we put in the \u201cAsean-X\u201d principle in the Asean charter as a formula for \u201cflexible participation\u201d (Article 21), but some of the group\u2019s strategic successes have happened via informal mechanisms without unanimous public statements. So let\u2019s not make unanimity of position in joint statements the be all and end all of centrality.That said, while centrality is an ongoing process, it was originally \u201cgranted by default\u201d during the post-Cold War strategic uncertainty in which distrust, disengagement and rivalry permeated regional powers.As Lee Jones described some of ARF\u2019s strategic history in the Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs (2010), Asean\u2019s centrality in managing great-power relations then correlated with the incapacity of great powers to successfully mediate their relations on their own. In other words, centrality was initially \u201cgiven\u201d to Asean because it was the best neutral alternative in town that had done relatively well in regional affairs by the 1990s.This often led to a sense of self-congratulatory complacency among Asean member states, but as polarising issues like the South China Sea suggest, increasing the degree of centrality can only happen through strong and sustained leadership from within Asean.Put differently, we now need to earn centrality, not just inherit it. We can consider several policies to this effect. First, if consensus is a precondition for centrality, then autonomy is a precondition for consensus. Only when Southeast Asian states are free from external meddling and deliberate wedge-driving by their strategic partners can any steps forward be discussed.Otherwise, some Asean members could become \u201cvanguard states\u201d in seeking out external great powers like the US to balance China, as recently argued by Laura Southgate and Nicholas Khoo in the Journal of Asian Security and International Affairs (2016) \u2014 effectively reverting Southeast Asia back into being another playground for the great powers.Aside from reminding Asean\u2019s regional partners about strategic autonomy, the group also needs to fulfil and deepen its integration commitments, whether through the Asean Community projects, or special engagement strategies for Cambodia and Laos.Second, on the South China Sea, we can break down the problem into three policy areas: dispute resolution (long-term through bilateral negotiations), tension management (medium-term through an AseanChina framework like the Code of Conduct) and pragmatic de-escalation steps (short-term through creative diplomatic engagements).This disaggregation allows us to recalibrate expectations about what Asean can or cannot achieve, rather than rehashing futile \u201cglass half-full, half-empty\u201d debates. For example, Asean is more useful for tension management, but less so for the others. Regional resources \u2014 diplomatic, financial and political \u2014 could therefore be aligned accordingly.Finally, if we insist on making Asean a \u201crules-based\u201d organisation based on the charter \u2014 even though centrality isn\u2019t tied to it \u2014 then as the group turns 50 next year, Indonesia could lead the charge to review the charter as stated in Article 50, or even perhaps consider amending it (as granted by Article 48).Before Asean\u2019s organisational challenges are settled \u2014 and the charter is only one of many \u2014 the quest for a stronger regional architecture would be grasping at straws.Whatever road Asean takes, Indonesia should lead the way, but leadership often means accepting that the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, including our own. \u2014The Jakarta PostPublished in Dawn, September 7th, 2016\n", "author": "Evan A.

Turkey launched an unprecedented operation inside Syria on August 24.Dubbed Euphrates Shield, it backs pro-Ankara opposition fighters in the goal of rooting out IS jihadists and Kurdish militia from the border area.A senior Turkish official confirmed two soldiers were killed and five injured in an attack by IS in northern Syria.The fatalities are the first of the Turkish operation inside Syria to be blamed on IS. Turkey had blamed the death of one soldier on August 28 in a similar attack on Kurdish militia.The army said in a statement carried by the private NTV television that the deaths came in a rocket attack on two \nTurkish tanks. \u201cTwo of our hero comrades were martyred and five were wounded in a rocket attack on two of our tanks by Daesh elements,\u201d it said. The army said the attack took place south of Al-Rai, where Turkish tanks opened a second front in their Syria operation at the weekend. The area is west of Jarabulus near the Turkish border which was retaken by pro-Ankara rebels at the start of the operation from jihadists.Turkish television showed pictures of military helicopters flying across the border to take the wounded for treatment in Turkey.Separately, two pro-Ankara Syrian fighters were killed and two others wounded in clashes in the same region, the army statement added.Turkey has so far hailed its operation as a success and IS jihadists were at the weekend expelled from their last positions along the Turkish-Syrian border, depriving the group of a key transit point for recruits and supplies. Turkey wants to establish a safe zone in the 98-kilometre (61-mile) area stretching from Jarabulus to Azaz to the west.

Around 70 per cent of terrorist attacks in the province have involved the use of IEDs, according to Shafqat Malik, the additional inspector general of the bomb disposal squad. He informed this reporter that in KP 5,228 incidents of IED blasts took place from 2009 to 2015. Another 210 cases have already been recorded this year. According to KP police\u2019s official statistics, 21 people, security personnel and civilians included, have been killed and 122 injured in 23 IED attacks in Peshawar this year. In 2015, at least 26 people, both civilians and police personnel, were killed and 53 injured in as many as 37 IED attacks. Of these, about 20 attacks were related to extortion and not terrorism. Mr Malik, who is also a forensic, ballistic and bomb disposal expert, is calling on the government to establish an inspectorate to prevent criminal elements from getting access to IEDs. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAn IED can be made using electrical wire, fuse and batteries.\u2014File photo\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWhat is an IED?\nIEDs require little time to make as no scientific training or laboratory is needed. Most IEDs are made of the following components: cell phone, electrical wire, fuse, batteries, electrical tape and a solid-state semiconductor device. \nFertiliser, gunpowder hydrogen peroxide and sugar can be used as explosive materials. They may be packed with additional materials or enhancements, such as nails or glass, in order to increase the shrapnel force of the blast. A bomb disposal unit official says that many insurgents use IEDs and suicide jackets made from military grade and commercial explosives that are more destructive than homemade bombs. The majority of extortion-related blasts in KP, however, involve homemade explosives. An IED is easy to hide and can even be concealed inside a pressure cooker. It can be detonated from a distance using a remote control and does not require a suicide bomber for delivery. \u201cIEDs were first used by the Irish Republic Army (IRA),\u201d says Mr Malik, adding that while groups like the Pakistani Taliban are not as sophisticated as the IRA, they have learnt how to use them effectively over the passage of time. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA dismantled IED.\u2014Photo by author\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nEffects of IEDs\nApart from death, the intense pressure from and IED blast can burst eardrums and cause the brain to smash against the inside of the skull, leading to deafness, concussion, blindness, and swelling of the brain, according to Dr Zeeshan at the Hayatabad Medical Complex. An IED explosion can damage vehicles and property due to blast wave, heat and fire. According to Mr Malik, the KP government needs to control the production, transportation and sale of ammonium nitrate fertilisers, commercial explosives and other ingredients used in IEDs. \u201cThe government needs to establish an inspectorate to keep a check on factories that are using explosive material for commercial purposes,\u201d he suggested. Selling commercial explosives to criminals is a profitable business, he adds. Mr Malik says that during 2013 a huge decline was witnessed in IED explosions after the federal government revoked the licences for transporting commercial explosives. However, he says that this is not an effective solution since it only targeted their transportation and not production. Establishment of an inspectorate\nAfter the passage of the 18th amendment to the Constitution, the KP government passed the Explosives Act in September 2013 in order to regulate explosives and avoid their misuse. The Home & Tribal Affairs Department was tasked to establish an inspectorate to monitor the use of commercial explosives at district and tehsil levels. However, Additional Secretary Home and Tribal Affair Department Siraj Ahmad told this reporter that it would take further time to establish the inspectorate since the hiring of staff required federal approval. He also revealed that no policy has been devised yet to regulate commercial explosives.
