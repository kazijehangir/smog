Altaf Hussain\u2019s latest harangue through telephonic addresses to MQM workers in America and South Africa lends credence to these theories.  This arrangement was, perhaps, necessary to ensure the success of the party\u2019s candidate for city mayor in the elections held a few days later. Waseem Akhtar, who was nominated with the approval of Altaf Hussain months ago, swept the polls easily with not a single MQM vote wasted. Any reaction from London against the decision of the Pakistan-based committee would have divided the party which could have caused it to lose control of the city government. By separating the Karachi and London committees, the MQM has apparently escaped the possibility of being banned. Almost all the major political parties are opposed to any move that could lead to the disintegration of the party into splinters thus strengthening militancy. For sure, the ongoing Rangers operation in Karachi has crippled the party\u2019s militant wing and contained its capacity to bring the city to a halt as it did frequently in the past. But the party is still deeply entrenched in the city and its vote bank has remained intact as demonstrated in the local government polls and various by-elections. The creation of the Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) led by Mustafa Kamal may have made some dents in the MQM but it has failed to make much of an impact on the city\u2019s politics largely because of the perception of it being sponsored by the security establishment as part of a plan to re-engineer Karachi\u2019s politics. The latest crisis in the MQM may result in PSP support for some more defectors, but there is little possibility of it making any inroads into the hard-core Urdu-speaking vote bank. Such political manipulations by the security agencies have failed in the past too. In fact, the Rangers\u2019 revenge action following Aug 22 has played into Altaf Hussain\u2019s politics of victimhood so cleverly exploited by him in the past. Sealing and bulldozing MQM offices without legal sanction will certainly strengthen the hard-liners in the party. The spectacle of Farooq Sattar being dragged out of the Karachi Press Club by uniformed officers and forcibly taken to the Rangers headquarters is hard to rationalise.

PPP leaders Syed Khurshid Shah and Aitzaz Ahsan on Tuesday told PTI vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi that they would respond to his party\u2019s formal invitation to participate in the Sept 3 anti-government rally in Lahore after consulting their top leadership. Hours after Mr Qureshi\u2019s meeting with the PPP leaders, PTI chairman Imran Khan announced that his party would hold a public meeting in Karachi\u2019s Nishtar Park on Sept 6 to express solidarity with the country and to condemn MQM chief Altaf Hussain\u2019s anti-Pakistan speech. \nPublic meeting in Karachi on Sept 6, says Imran\n\nSources in the PPP told Dawn that the party was reluctant to join the Sept 3 rally because of Imran Khan\u2019s habit of taking \u201cunilateral decisions\u201d. A senior PPP leader said that keeping in mind the outcome of the PTI\u2019s 2014 sit-in against alleged rigging in the general elections, the party would have to be cautious while taking a decision about joining the PTI rally. When asked if the party could nominate someone for a token participation in the Sept 3 rally, he said it also appeared to be difficult in the present circumstances because it would be seen as providing a \u201ctacit support\u201d to the PTI\u2019s unilateral call. Moreover, he added, other opposition parties such as the Awami National Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement had also distanced themselves from the PTI\u2019s plan to hold rallies on the Panama issue. He said the PPP leadership also considered the PTI\u2019s decision to file a petition in the Supreme Court as \u201cunwise\u201d. Talking to reporters after the meeting, the PPP and PTI leaders, however, claimed that there was a complete unity among the opposition parties on the Panama issue and all of them wanted an across-the-board accountability of all those who owned offshore companies as revealed by the Panama Papers. Mr Qureshi said the parliamentary committee formed by the National Assembly speaker to draft terms of reference (ToR) for the proposed judicial commission on Panamagate had \u201cmet premature death due to the government\u2019s \nstubbornness\u201d. \u201cThe ToR committee is now a dead horse,\u201d he said, adding that the MQM had already come out of the committee whereas Jamaat-i-Islami had decided to approach the apex court after getting disappointed from the committee.

Police reproduced MQM leaders MNA Kanwar Naveed Jameel, Qamar Mansoor and Shahid Pasha, who have been in custody since Aug 23, along with around 40 workers, including three women, because their last physical remand ended on Aug 30. The police sought further extension in the custody of the suspects and submitted that they had recovered sticks and iron rods, allegedly used during the crime, on the lead provided by the detained suspects and added that some eyewitnesses had identified around 25 suspects during identification parades conducted by a judicial magistrate on Aug 30. However, the defence counsel opposed the extension in physical remand and asked the court to send them to prison. The administrative judge sent the suspects to prison on 14-day judicial remand and directed the police to submit investigation reports. The suspects have been booked in two cases registered at the Artillery Madian police station under multiple allegations, including sedition and offences against the state, after the Aug 22 riots. A highly-provocative speech of their London-based chief on Aug 22 outside the Karachi Press Club allegedly triggered the violent protest, arson attacks and ransacking of media houses and left a passer-by dead. Meanwhile, MQM leader MNA Kanwar Naveed Jameel informally spoke to the media while leaving the court premises and said that he had confidence in Dr Farooq Sattar and was convinced with his policy. The bail applications of the three women activists Rabia, Sumera and Quratual Ain are fixed before an ATC on Thursday. The first case was registered under Sections 302 (premeditated murder), 324 (attempted murder), 353 (criminal force to deter public servant from discharge of his duty), 147 (punishment for rioting), 148 (rioting, armed with deadly weapon), 149 (every member of unlawful assembly guilty of offence committed in prosecution of common object), 186 (obstructing public servant in discharge of public functions), 123-A (condemnation of the creation of the state and advocacy of abolition of its sovereignty), 124-A (sedition), 427 (mischief causing damage to the amount of fifty rupees), 435 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to cause damage, etc), 436 (mischief by fire or explosive substance with intent to destroy house, etc), 337 (shajjah), 506-B (criminal for intimidation) and 109 (abetment) of the Pakistan Penal Code (PPC) read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997. The second FIR was registered under Sections 123-A, 124-A, 109 and 34 of the PPC read with Section 7 of the ATA against the same set of suspects. Besides 1,500 to 2,000 unidentified men and women, the police also named around a dozen party leaders, including Altaf Hussain, Dr Farooq Sattar and Amir Khan as absconders in both cases registered at the Artillery Madian police station.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Ishaq Tanoli", "title": "Over 40 MQM activists sent to jail in media attacks cases"}}

{"1281026": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "SENATOR Mohammad Yaqoob Khan\u2019s view that the \u2018poor are born to serve the rich\u2019 (Aug 26) may sound offensive but it reflects a pervasive mindset that prevails not only in Pakistan but in countries like the USA. This is not surprising given the fact that a British imam and many sheikhs in the Arab world believe that slavery was banned by Abraham Lincoln and not by Islam. My personal view is that what Lincoln did is apparently tenable under the Islamic concept of maslaha mursala (broader public interest). A bitter truth is that inequality has remained a feature of most societies, and the countless studies by political philosophers like Aristotle, Tacitus, Moska, Michel, Marx, Pareto and C. Wright Mill attest to this. What a pity that demokratia (power of the people) never succeeds in equalising citizens.James Maddison\u2019s idea of having a bicameral legislature to balance the brute power of the proletariat against the bourgeoisie did not bear fruit. We only have to look at the performance of our National Assembly versus the Senate, Lok Sabha versus Rajya Sabha, the House of Commons versus the House of Lords, so on. Nevertheless, all democracies envisioned `opportunities for political participation to larger proportions of the population\u2019, and across-the-board accountability (no loan write-offs or plots and permits). Democracy is a progressive effort to equalise citizens before the law, rather than legalising the elite and mafias. It is unfortunate that a senator regards inequality as an unchangeable status quo.William A. Welsh says: \u201cThe rise of democracy has signalled the decline of elites\u201d (Leaders and Elites, p 1). But, a bitter lesson of history is that demokratia had always been an ideal, never a reality. History reminds us that no system, not even ochlocracy (mobocracy) could ever bulldoze governing elites. The Delhi Sultanate, the Mughals, and the English ruled through handpicked elites.The \u2018equal citizen\u2019 as enshrined in our constitution has remained a myth. Even American democracy is run by a handful of specialised people while the majority of the population is a silent spectator, a \u201cbewildered herd\u201d (Chomsky).Amjed Jaaved Rawalpindi(2)THE senator\u2019s contentious remarks have underscored the chauvinistic mindset of the privileged class towards the underdogs of Pakistani society.The biggest irony is that the same senator had been elected thrice from NA-263, but he did not establish a single hospital or educational institution in his hometown. In this backdrop it comes as no surprise that he is utterly nonchalant towards the miserable plight of the poor people living next to his home. Meanwhile, he also dilated upon the misconception prevalent in our society that God has made social and economic divisions.Quite contrary to his comments, the truth is that it is not God but people like the senator who have contributed to the creation of such disparities. To sum it up, people of such mindset can hardly alleviate the miseries of poor and downtrodden people.M.

The authors explain why efforts to build a comprehensive Afghanistan-centric regional security order have failed and make suggestions for resetting inter-state relations.Mr Harpviken said the book had been completed a year ago and that his co-author and him had wanted to research even more and warned that the book did not contain easy answers.Those who attended the launch expressed interest in regional issues and their impact on different countries and a lively discussion followed Mr Harpviken\u2019s speech.Associated Press regional correspondent Kathy Gannon, who survived being shot in Afghanistan in 2014, suggested that the issue of borders between Afghanistan, Pakistan and India be discussed in order to ensure regional stability.To this, Mr Harpviken said that solving border problems may not address all issues between countries of the region.Defence analyst Zahid Hussain said Afghanistan was also affected by many external factors including the rivalry between India and Pakistan.\u201cThe 2,500 kilometre border between Afghanistan and Pakistan is very porous and people can travel through to both sides, which is very difficult to manage,\u201d he said.The dispute over the Durand Line is also an issue between the two countries and Afghanistan is the only country which opposed the formation of Pakistan in the United Nations and refused to accept it, Mr Hussain said.The analyst said that according to some reports, the Taliban and Russia were in some sort of contact, which may increase the problems of the region.Ms Gannon spoke about competitions between militant groups in Afghanistan, which she said are trying to organise themselves and making recruitments.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "A Reporter", "title": "\u2018Afghanistan is plagued by internal problems\u2019"}}

PPP leaders Syed Khurshid Shah and Aitzaz Ahsan on Tuesday told PTI vice chairman Shah Mehmood Qureshi that they would respond to his party\u2019s formal invitation to participate in the Sept 3 anti-government rally in Lahore after consulting their top leadership. Hours after Mr Qureshi\u2019s meeting with the PPP leaders, PTI chairman Imran Khan announced that his party would hold a public meeting in Karachi\u2019s Nishtar Park on Sept 6 to express solidarity with the country and to condemn MQM chief Altaf Hussain\u2019s anti-Pakistan speech. \nPublic meeting in Karachi on Sept 6, says Imran\n\nSources in the PPP told Dawn that the party was reluctant to join the Sept 3 rally because of Imran Khan\u2019s habit of taking \u201cunilateral decisions\u201d. A senior PPP leader said that keeping in mind the outcome of the PTI\u2019s 2014 sit-in against alleged rigging in the general elections, the party would have to be cautious while taking a decision about joining the PTI rally. When asked if the party could nominate someone for a token participation in the Sept 3 rally, he said it also appeared to be difficult in the present circumstances because it would be seen as providing a \u201ctacit support\u201d to the PTI\u2019s unilateral call. Moreover, he added, other opposition parties such as the Awami National Party and the Muttahida Qaumi Movement had also distanced themselves from the PTI\u2019s plan to hold rallies on the Panama issue. He said the PPP leadership also considered the PTI\u2019s decision to file a petition in the Supreme Court as \u201cunwise\u201d. Talking to reporters after the meeting, the PPP and PTI leaders, however, claimed that there was a complete unity among the opposition parties on the Panama issue and all of them wanted an across-the-board accountability of all those who owned offshore companies as revealed by the Panama Papers. Mr Qureshi said the parliamentary committee formed by the National Assembly speaker to draft terms of reference (ToR) for the proposed judicial commission on Panamagate had \u201cmet premature death due to the government\u2019s \nstubbornness\u201d. \u201cThe ToR committee is now a dead horse,\u201d he said, adding that the MQM had already come out of the committee whereas Jamaat-i-Islami had decided to approach the apex court after getting disappointed from the committee. Mr Qureshi said the PTI would completely support the bill drafted by Aitzaz Ahsan for formation of the Panama commission and it would soon be moved in the Senate as a private member\u2019s bill.

Ms Swaraj on her part ruled out any dialogue with Islamabad, saying \u201ctalks with Pakistan will happen only when it takes steps on the Pathankot terror attack\u201d since \u201cterror and talks cannot go hand-in-hand\u201d. Mr Kerry is in Delhi for the second strategic and commercial dialogue between India and the United States. \u201cI briefed Secretary Kerry on the continuing problem of cross-border terrorism that India and the larger region face from Pakistan,\u201d Ms Swaraj said, adding: \u201cWe both agreed that nations must not maintain double standards, such as the categorisation of good and bad terrorists, nor must they act as sanctuaries and safe havens for terrorist organisations.\u201d \nTalks with Pakistan only after Pathankot probe, says Swaraj\n\nShe said both sides reaffirmed the urgent necessity for Pakistan to dismantle \u201csafe havens for terrorists and criminal networks, including Lashkar-e-Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad and D Company\u201d, the latter being India\u2019s reference to Mumbai underworld don Dawood Ibrahim who Delhi says is being sheltered by Pakistan. \u201cSecretary Kerry and I also agreed on the need for Pakistan to do more to bring the perpetrators of the 2008 Mumbai and 2016 Pathankot terrorist attacks to justice quickly,\u201d she said. Mr Kerry agreed. \u201cWe cannot and will not distinguish between good and bad terrorists\u2026 US stands with India on all matters of terrorism, no matter where it comes from. It\u2019s crystal clear we are on the same view over it.\u201d Ms Swaraj said they spoke on the need to strengthen the international legal regime to counter terrorism. \u201cWe agreed on additional measures to strengthen our counterterrorism cooperation, specifically, to work for early operationalisation of the agreement on exchange of information on known or suspected terrorists. We will also intensify intelligence sharing and continue to work closely to get terrorist entities listed by the UN system, by coordinating our approach to the UN 1267 Committee.\u201d Mr Kerry said the United States had been speaking to all the countries in the region about the issue, and appreciated Pakistan\u2019s role in eliminating the threat. He confirmed that progress was made on an agreement about the construction of six nuclear reactors by US giant Westinghouse. \u201cWe hope to see our civil nuclear cooperation take shape in the form of new reactors that will deliver reliable electricity to tens of millions of Indian households.\u201d The deal has been held up in the past by concerns over India\u2019s laws that would make US companies liable for accidents at plants they helped build. Ms Swaraj said she had thanked Mr Kerry for American support for India\u2019s bid to join the elite Nuclear Suppliers Group (NSG), a bloc of 48 countries. Earlier this year, the US led an initiative for India to gain admission to the bloc that trades in sophisticated nuclear material and technology, but China and a group of countries blocked India\u2019s membership bid. Washington has promised to push India\u2019s bid at \u201cthe highest levels\u201d before the next NSG meeting later this year. The United States on Tuesday agreed to \u201clook into\u201d India\u2019s concerns over the Obama administration\u2019s move to hike fees for H1B and L1 visas. India Inc. raised the issue at the India-US CEO Forum, saying the move hurt Indian IT firms which are the main users of these non-immigrant temporary work visas. Ms Swaraj and Commerce Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said India had conveyed its concerns to the US side during a bilateral strategic and commercial dialogue. The visa fee hike has \u201caffected our people-to-people exchanges\u2026 I would urge you to find a just and non-discriminatory solution to these issues,\u201d Ms Swaraj told Mr Kerry. Indian Defence Minister Manohar Parrikar and US Defense Secretary Ashton Carter sealed an agreement on Monday in Washington in efforts to strengthen defence ties to counter concerns over China\u2019s growing military assertiveness, reports said. Both countries can now access each other\u2019s military bases.
