For the city\u2019s planners, this was meant to be a stop-gap arrangement; the landfill was originally located in the Kuri area, but ended up being moved here.If the wind is against you, you can smell the site before it comes into view. Located just off the I.J. Principal Road that divides Rawalpindi and Islamabad, the dump covers an area the size of one sub-sector, roughly where the I-12/1 neighbourhood should have been located.Bedford lorries and newer-model dumper trucks wind their way down the dusty path leading to the heart of the landfill. Standing on a small mound of dirt and trash, waving off buzzing flies, midges and other sundry bugs, a municipal worker makes an entry in his notebook for every load of rubbish that ends up here.Further afield, sanitary and municipal workers offload the waste. Be it human, animal or plant; metal, plastic, glass or porcelain \u2014 everything comes here. It is then sorted by local scavengers; the kabariye, who make a living separating recyclable items from the rest.As I scan this vast field of refuse, all I see is a tragic-yet-routine tale of civic negligence, of waste being buried blindly, no matter what the environmental consequence. But this festering Petri dish of a garbage disposal site has proven to be just as significant for a handful of scientists and academics from the Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) as the neglected Penicillin cultures in his laboratory were for the British scientist Dr Alexander Fleming.\u201cProf Safia Ahmed, Prof Fariha Hasan, Dr M. Ishtiaq Ali and I started working on the biodegradation of plastics at our microbiology research laboratory in 2002,\u201d says Dr Aamer Ali Shah, one of the co-authors of a research paper that recently caused a stir in the scientific community by revealing the discovery of a fungus that is able to utilise plastic polymers as the source of its food.The paper, which bears the otherwise dull title \u2018Biodegradation of polyester polyurethane by Aspergillus tubingensis\u2019, actually outlines a groundbreaking discovery; confirming the existence of naturally-occurring fungi that have the ability to perform \u201cbio-degradation and bio-remediation of pollutants in soil or wastewater\u201d.\u201cThis organism was isolated from soil and/or plastic samples collected from the I-12 garbage dumping site,\u201d says Dr Shah, explaining that researchers took topsoil and water samples from the landfill.For anyone even remotely familiar with humanity\u2019s growing plastic problem, this is nothing short of a \u201cEureka!\u201d moment. A recent study by the University of California estimates that our civilisation has produced over nine billion tonnes of plastic, most of which is conventionally thought to be non-biodegradable.But this discovery could change all of that. \u201cIf we get the right resources and funds, we would be able to establish an actual plastic degrading facility within three to five years,\u201d Dr Shah maintains.According to the scientists, the Aspergillus microbes were isolated in a laboratory and provided the right environmental conditions (such as temperature, pH, time, nutrients, etc) so that it would degrade polymers.What has been observed is that the micro-organisms break down plastics in two ways. They can either attach themselves to the surface of the plastic to form a bio-film, releasing enzymes that dissolve the polymer, or penetrate it mechanically in order to \u2018digest\u2019 it.It is a slow but naturally-occurring process, one that is not visible to the naked eye. \u201cMost synthetic plastics are produced from non-renewable petrochemical-based raw materials, making them resistant to degradation in the environment.\u201dDuring the course of their work, the team at QAU has also been keeping tabs on the toxicity of the by-products formed during this process.\u201cPollutants that only degrade partially can sometimes become more toxic than the parent compound,\u201d he says, explaining how polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can partially degrade to vinyl chloride, which is quite toxic.In an ideal situation, the microorganisms will be able to break down these complex compounds into water and carbon dioxide, achieving their complete bio-degradation.Given the import of what they have discovered, the scientists are hopeful: \u201cWe have done these experiments in our laboratories using whatever resources were available to us. We have now reached a stage where we can apply these micro-organisms in the field, but for that we need more resources.\u201dAnd those resources cannot come too soon. According to the foreman of the I-12 landfill, the site cannot take more than a few more months\u2019 worth of trash. \u201cThere used to be great big depressions in the ground here, which have now been completely filled up with garbage,\u201d he says, pointing to the horizon as a truckload of dirt is deposited on top of a pile of refuse and flattened by earth-moving machines.Once space runs out, the site will have to be relocated yet again. Unless a permanent solution is found, our civic managers may remain content to bury their problems in this and other landfills like it.

Over 16 years since the colonial Lunacy Act, 1912 \u2014 which quasi-criminalised being mentally ill \u2014 was replaced with the Pakistan Mental Health Ordinance, 2001, KP joined Sindh and Punjab this year in enacting its own mental health act. But these legislative changes have yet to provide even marginal relief to the estimated 20pc to 34pc of Pakistanis living with some form of mental disorder, exacerbated by the high prevalence of stressors such as poverty and violence. The most at-risk are inmates with serious psychiatric diseases, to whom the state still routinely awards death sentences, even though the diagnoses call into question the convictions. Then there are those who attempt suicide, which is still a criminal offence under the Pakistan Penal Code, and only inhibits the ability of families and healthcare professionals to provide necessary treatment. Even when mental illness is not treated as a crime, cultural stigma is enough to leave many suffering alone and in silence; even if this is overcome, Pakistan has less than 400 practising psychiatrists. It will take a lot of time and effort to build our national healthcare capacity to fulfil our mental health needs, but treatment is just one aspect. Promoting mental well-being is as essential, and ought to be embedded as a key target in every sector of national development, including education and employment. Implementing policies that create supportive environments in schools and workplaces can help normalise mental illness in public discourse and, more importantly, serve as a primary point of intervention for many who might otherwise fall through the cracks. Research conducted by Aga Khan University estimated the cost of Pakistan\u2019s mental health burden at Rs250bn per annum.

To strengthen the roots of the film industry and its revival it\u2019s important to enlist the support of like-minded people such as Dr Ishrat Husain, Ameena Saiyid, Jamil Baig, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. KFS was formed to support positive trends in film-making. The first KFS meeting was held at Governor House followed by this fundraising dinner.\u201cImportant film festivals around the world promote cities. PiFF aims to give a platform to talented film-makers and documentary-makers bearing cultural colours. With it, we hope to bring back life to this city of ours. We ask for support from all quarters and the diplomatic community.\u201d PiFF Festival director Abrarul Hassan and founder of the 60 Second International Film Festival walked the guests through a visual presentation of the PiFF\u2019s categories and events such as primary goal, membership and perks, film screenings, workshops, residencies, industry linkages, mentoring, gala opening and closing, panel discussions, exhibition of posters, film archive, photography and music, mobile screening, VR screening booths and AR display, activity timeline, daily story competition, women and film, besides features, documentary features, shorts etc. He said it created an opportunity for South Asian film-makers to work with their Pakistani counterparts and nurture the new generation of film-makers besides exploring the art of storytelling. \u201cWhy Karachi? Karachi was, is and always will be the custodian of film-making in Pakistan,\u201d the festival director said. Governor Zubair, who is also the patron-in-chief of PiFF, in his address said, \u201cI like films just as much as anybody else. But film-making was not considered a good thing during the \u2018Islamisation\u2019 era in Pakistan. The Quaid-i-Azam\u2019s narrative for Pakistan calls for a much more balanced approach, to maintain a fine balance and freedom for all cultural and social interests and the freedom to express oneself.\u201cCreativity is best expressed through sports, TV, films etc. Karachi was once at the heart of film-making with Waheed Murad, Mohammad Ali, Nadeem, Shakeel, all great stars from Karachi. Then the industry shifted to Lahore but it has now returned to Karachi. World-class films are being produced now. Me and my wife love going to cinemas to watch films, especially Pakistani films.

We need to change the narrative for this new Pakistan. Just one example was when Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy was invited to the PM House along with members of the diplomatic corps and A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness was screened in an attempt to reign in honour killings. Eventually the legislation was passed. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy\u2019s topic remains outstanding.\u201d He said PiFF has given momentum to Karachi. \u201cWe are fighting for Karachi on various fronts such as working with Jahangir Khan, holding hockey tournaments and I\u2019m trying to bring the PSL final match to Karachi.

Earlier on Monday, the Sri Lankans were dismissed cheaply in their second innings for 96 but still managed to set Pakistan a target of 317 to win. Wahab Riaz and Yasir were the main destroyers but that really was not enough to bring Pakistan to safer shores. As I wrote these lines, Pakistan were ominously poised, having lost five of their top order batsmen with just 50 on the board in a snail-paced batting display. For this I will not hesitate to blame the two Pakistan openers Shan Masood and Sami Aslam who looked so ordinary and out of place as the Sri Lankan bowlers Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Gamage and Nuwan Pradeep repeatedly beat their bats and had them groping at the ball.Shan\u2019s statue like existence was not only painful to watch but also left the handful of fans annoyed as he needlessly went into a shell to put pressure of his partners who came in after the fall of Sami\u2019s wicket.  His 21 runs off 101 deliveries and an unimpressive 15 in 69 balls in the first innings do not speak much of his skills as an opening batsman of an international team.As for Babar Azam, he may be a talented ODI player but he has clearly looked out of sort at the Test level, having lost his wicket cheaply on many occasions during the six Tests he has played.Serious cricket needs serious players who should be technically sound too and could tackle spin and pace as well as combat the nature of the wickets and conditions that change from session to session in five-day cricket.  The Sri Lankans who have clearly dominated the two Tests would no doubt be smiling at the conclusion of this series for their professional approach paying off in every possible way.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "Qamar Ahmed", "title": "Lacklustre Pakistan lost for ideas as SL dominate"}}

Meanwhile, Turkish authorities announced that a second employee of the US consulate in Istanbul had been \u201cinvited\u201d to the Istanbul's chief prosecutor's office to testify. Authorities did not explain why. Reports say the employee is a Turkish citizen, and the prosecutor's office said his wife and child had also been detained for questioning. The US on Sunday suspended the issuing of visas for Turkish citizens hoping to visit or study in the country after Turkey arrested US consulate employee Metin Topuz last week on allegations of espionage. The visa suspension prompted Turkey to immediately halt visa services in the US in a tit-for-tat response. Turkey's foreign ministry summoned the embassy's second-in-charge on Monday asking that Washington review the decision that caused \u201cunnecessary escalation\u201d and \u201cvictimised\u201d both Turkish and US citizens, a Turkish foreign ministry official said.

Other Americans held in Turkey include Pastor Andrew Brunson who was detained last year and is accused of terror-related charges for alleged ties to Gulen's movement.
