Rousseff was Brazil\u2019s first female president, with a storied career that includes a stint as a Marxist guerrilla jailed and tortured in the 1970s during the country\u2019s dictatorship. She was accused of breaking fiscal laws in her management of the federal budget.Opposition lawmakers, who made clear early on the only solution was getting her out of office, argued that the manoeuvres masked yawning deficits from high spending and ultimately exacerbated the recession in a nation that had long enjoyed darling status among emerging economies.Nonsense, Rousseff countered time and again, proclaiming her innocence up to the end. Previous presidents used similar accounting techniques, she noted, saying the push to remove her was a bloodless coup d\u2019\u00e9tat by elites fuming over the populist polices of her Workers\u2019 Party the last 13 years.The opposition needed 54 of the 81 senators to vote in favour for her to be removed. They got many more, winning in a landslide of sorts, 61-20. \u201cToday is the day that 61 men, many of them charged and corrupt, threw 54 million Brazilian votes in the garbage,\u201d Rousseff tweeted minutes after the decision.Rousseff won re-election in 2014, garnering more than 54m votes. In the background of the entire fight was a wide-ranging investigation into billions of dollars in kickbacks at state oil company Petrobras. The two-year probe has led to the jailing of dozens of top businessmen and politicians from across the political spectrum, and threatens many of the same lawmakers who voted to remove Rousseff.Rousseff argued that many opponents just wanted her out of the way so they could save their own skins by tampering with the investigation, which Rousseff had refused to do.Many lawmakers and Brazilians nationwide, meanwhile, blamed Rousseff for the graft even though she has never been personally implicated. They argued that she had to know, as many of the alleged bribes happened while her party was in power.Rousseff\u2019s removal creates many questions that are not easily answered. Michel Temer, her vice president who became her nemesis, will serve out the remainder of her term through 2018. But Brazilians have already gotten a taste of Temer\u2019s leadership, and they are clearly unimpressed.In May, Temer took over as interim president after the Senate impeached and suspended Rousseff. The 75-year-old career politician named a cabinet of all-white men, a decision roundly criticised in a nation that is more than 50pc non-white. Three of his ministers were forced to resign within weeks of taking their jobs because of corruption allegations, which also follow Temer and threaten his hold on power.When Temer announced the opening of the Olympics on Aug 5, he was so vociferously booed that he remained out of sight for the remainder of the games.Rousseff\u2019s allies have vowed to appeal to the country\u2019s highest court. While previous petitions to the court have failed to stop the impeachment process, at the very least legal wrangling will keep the issue front and center.The decision also leaves many question marks over the economy, expected to decline for a second straight year. Temer has promised to pull the country of 200m people from its recession by tackling reforms that have long been taboo, such as slimming public pensions. But he has not been able to accomplish much the last three months as interim president, and it remains to be seen whether Congress will be willing to work with him.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "AP", "title": "Brazil\u2019s president Rousseff ousted from office by Senate"}}

{"1281378": {"date": "Updated September 04, 2016", "article": "Once the most ubiquitous part of Karachi\u2019s heritage, Irani \u2018hotels\u2019 are fast disappearing from the urban landscape...The Irani cafes of Karachi\nby Asif NooraniSometime in the 1920s, Rustom Aspandiar Bahmani, a Zoroastrian, left Yazd, then a small desert town in Iran, with his companions. All of them perched on mulebacks trotted all the way to Zahidan, from where they took a painfully slow train to Quetta. A faster train took them to Karachi from where they boarded a sailboat to Bombay. After a six-day voyage, the vessel dropped anchor at the city\u2019s harbour. The city was not unfamiliar to Zoroastrians. Waves of Zoroastrians had migrated from Iran between the 8th and 10th centuries and had made their way up the social ladder as successful businessmen and industrialists. Quite understandably, they were supportive of their co-religionists. To cut a long story short, Bahmani, like other Zoroastrians, made their mark in the restaurant business. They were followed by Bahais, practitioners of the 19th century religion, and Muslims. The latter moved to the state of Hyderabad in large numbers.A good number of Iranis didn\u2019t go to Bombay, however; they decided to settle down in Karachi. There were more than a hundred Irani restaurants (Irani hotels in common parlance) in Karachi in the 1970s but today hardly 10 remain. After Independence, not many opened in the newer parts of the city. Caf\u00e9 Liberty and the one in Nursery market in PECHS (whose name nobody seems to recall) were among the exceptions. Areas such as Defence Housing Authority and North Nazimabad never had a single Irani restaurant.The middle class localities and commercial areas of the city were once punctuated with Irani restaurants. Most of them had \u2018cafes\u2019 preceding their names. Four restaurants were in close proximity in Saddar. Fredrick\u2019s Cafeteria was the haunt of punters who frequented the place after placing bets at the city\u2019s racecourse. It also had a pay phone which one could use after inserting two coins of 10 paisas each in the slots. Caf\u00e9 George, on the intersection of Victoria Road (now Abdullah Haroon Road) and Frere Road (now Shahrah-i-Liaquat) was known for its snacks, particularly its mutton patties and the accompanying chutney concocted by its cook (chef was a term that was yet to come in vogue). On the other side of the road was Eastern Coffee House, which was named India Coffee House until a few years after Partition. It was initially run by the India Coffee Board, (ICB), which ran a chain of coffee houses since the mid-1930s (it still does in India). India Coffee House in Saddar became Zelin\u2019s Coffee House but, soon after, an Irani took over, who christened it Eastern Coffee House. Mr Merchant, a coffee-taster turned manager at the ICB, then set up Pioneer Coffee House in what is now the Electronics Market. Eastern Coffee House was the haunt of writers and student leaders. Some people were regular visitors. Come rain or shine, they were there in the afternoons. Once the Marxist student leader Ali Mukhtar Rizvi, who was part of the Moharram zuljina juloos, climbed up the stairs, had a quick cup of tea before joining the tail of the long procession. Then there was one Mr Bilgrami, who never loosened the buttons of his sherwani even when mercury crossed the 110oF mark. In those days air conditioning in restaurants was a rarity. Only Shehzan and Pioneer had that facility. Fredrick\u2019s Cafetaria and Eastern Coffee House had sections for families as well. As you walked towards the Elphinstone Street (now Zebunnisa Street), you saw Caf\u00e9 Parisian (the septuagenarian Parisian Bakery is still there). Then as you proceeded towards the corner of Bohri Bazaar, you saw the plebeian Boman Abadon Irani Restaurant where ready-made tea was served. Outside the restaurant there was a row of shoe-shine men from what was then the NWFP (now Khyber Pakhtunkhwa). You would place your foot on a pedestal and the man seated on a stool would live up to his promise of making your shoe shine like a mirror. \u201cSheesha banaiga\u201d used to be their slogan.Diagonally opposite the Parisian was Caf\u00e9 Gulzar, which had its loyal clientele too. The Karachi-born singer C.H. Atma, who had migrated to Bombay, visited his native city sometime in the \u201960s. He made it a point to visit two places \u2014 Abdullah Shah Ghazi\u2019s mazaar and Caf\u00e9 Gulzar. In an interview with a local journalist he said that whereas he got spiritual satisfaction at the mausoleum, the food in his favourite restaurant gave him gastronomic satisfaction. \u201cIt still tastes as delicious as it did before Partition,\u201d he said.At the other end of Victoria Road, opposite Hotel Metropole, was Caf\u00e9 Victoria, which was spacious and comfortable. It had a number of delicacies listed on its menu, but to a friend, who frequented it in the \u201960s, the piece-de-resistance was the Mahi Kabab \u2014 \u2018mahi\u2019 being the Persian word for fish. Caf\u00e9 Subhani, close to Fleet Club, was widely known for its Chullu Kabab, an Iranian specialty kabab served over a bed of buttered rice. It closed down a year or two ago. It is now owned by locals, who have refurbished it and renamed it Chullu Kabab Sistani.Two Irani restaurants which are still there are adjacent to each other. Pehlvi Restaurant, at the intersection of M.A. Jinnah Road and Zebunnisa Street, offers tea in cups and also has a small stall which serves tea in chainaks \u2014 small metallic teapots. Next to it is Caf\u00e9 Durakhshan, owned by the same family, where tea is served in teapots, accompanied with sugar in a pot and milk in a small jug. Its fastest selling dish is the Spicy Pulao. It retains the feel of old while Pehlvi seems to have morphed into a more modern fast food joint.Almost invariably all Irani restaurants, not just in Karachi but also in Mumbai and Pune, are located at street corners, a testament to their early-mover advantage in real estate. They are open on two sides. It seems Pehlvi and Durakhshan were once one restaurant but were later divided between two siblings, so the latter does not enjoy having entrances from two sides. The present owners simply refuse to comment on this subject.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tKhairabad now and then: (Left) present day; (Right) 1947 as M.A. Jinnah\u2019s motorcade drove past (Photo from State Bank Museum)\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe only Irani Restaurant which was not in a corner was Caf\u00e9 Gloria in the small lane which is still called Capitol ki Gali. Capitol was one of the two cinemas owned by the Mobed family, who were Parsis. Flamingo, a snazzy restaurant on the first floor of the cinema, was particularly known for its cold coffee. While Flamingo was owned by a Zoroastrian, Caf\u00e9 Gloria\u2019s proprietor was a Bahai. Capitol Cinema and its twin, Paradise Cinema, have vanished like many other movie houses in Saddar. Caf\u00e9 Yasmeen near the Police Head Office on I.I. Chundrigar Road was the latest Irani restaurant demise and the one to suffer the most is the paanwallah outside \u2014all Irani restaurants have paan shops tucked in small spaces outside the premises. The paanwallah has lost his clientele and now closes shop at 6pm.Not too far from Cafe Yasmeen was Caf\u00e9 Victory on what was South Napier Road, which was renamed Altaf Hussain Road after the founding editor of Dawn. With the offices of the Dawn Group and Millat Publications being there, journalists thronged the caf\u00e9 at lunch hour. It was known particularly for its succulent beef steak and the sauce that topped it. Perhaps the only Irani restaurant which is faring quite well is Khairabad Tea Shop (see interview). It has its loyal clientele, some of whom keep returning even after years. Syed Abdullah Shah, the chief minister of Sindh from 1993-1996, paid a visit to have tea there after assuming the top office in the province. He recalled that Khairabad was his usual haunt while studying at the nearby S.M. Law College.    But why are so many Irani restaurants closing down despite their being a part of Karachi\u2019s heritage? Young Abbas Ahmed of Caf\u00e9 Durakhshan, an MBA, has the answer. \u201cFor one thing, the trend has changed,\u201d he says. \u201cNow there are fast food joints as well as eateries which specialise in items such as nihari, biryani or barbecue. Secondly, there is much hassle in running restaurants, particularly when the profits have dipped. You would be better off selling the restaurant and putting the money in fixed deposit.\u201d Why have the marble top tables that were the mark of Irani restaurants disappeared? \u201cSimply because they were too space consuming,\u201d explains Ahmed.  \u201cBut the bentwood chairs are still there. In fact, you are sitting on one. The large mirrors which give the impression of extra space have not disappeared either.\u201dThe Iranis are still very much into selling tea leaves. \u201cTwo of the leading shops, Islamia Tea and Iranian Tea are doing quite well,\u201d Ahmed points out. Irani restaurants may be vanishing but they have left their mark on their city. Proof, if proof be needed, is that the Tariq Road and Allama Iqbal Road intersection is still called Caf\u00e9 Liberty and the area near Fleet Club is known as Lucky Star, after the restaurants which dropped shutters years ago.\n\u201cThere were close to 100 Irani restaurants in the 50s and 60s, now there are less than 10.\u201d \u2014 Abbas Ali the proprietor of Khairabad Tea Shop\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAbbas Ali\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAbbas Ali, the proprietor of Khairabad Tea Shop, mans the counter of the restaurant at the intersection of I.I. Chundrigar Road and Dr Ziauddin Ahmed Road for at least six to eight hours a day. He greets you with a cheerful Khushamdeed (\u2018Welcome\u2019). However, if you wish to interview him, he politely asks you to see him after the peak hours \u2014 12 noon to 4pm. I talk to him when he is relatively free. AN: When was this restaurant set up? AA: In 1932 by my grandfather, who had migrated from Iran. My father was then a young man. AN: How come you call it a tea shop? I don\u2019t recall seeing an Irani restaurant in Karachi or Mumbai, not even Pune, where any restaurant bore that description. They are all called \u2018cafes\u2019, even though coffee is not a popular drink in our country, nor in that part of India. AA: That\u2019s a question that you should have asked my father, but he is up in the heavens. However, if you look at our menu displayed under the glass, you will find that we have renamed the restaurant. It is called \u2018Caf\u00e9 Khairabad (Tea Shop) and Food Centre\u2019. It\u2019s too long a name to be painted on the board fixed on top of the entrances so we have continued with the original name. AN: Why Khairabad?AA: That is where my family hails from in Iran. You will see quite a few restaurants named after the towns from where their owners belonged to. [There were also Caf\u00e9 Meharabad and Caf\u00e9 Ispahan, to name just two.] Sadly, they are among the many Irani restaurants that have dropped shutters. The latest casualty is Caf\u00e9 Yasmeen, which was on this very road. There were close to a hundred Irani restaurants in the 50s and 60s, now there are less than 10.AN: What\u2019s the reason for closures on such a vast scale?AA: The business is not that good. The electricity and gas charges are prohibitively high. The prices of meat and vegetables, not to mention cooking oil, have risen considerably. Wages have gone up too. We can\u2019t raise the food charges accordingly because there is strong consumer resistance.AN: The owners of Irani restaurants that I have met complain that extortion by members of political parties is a major cause of dropping the shutters. What do you have to say on that issue?AA: I wouldn\u2019t like to comment on that. You are a journalist. You should know better. (Smiles) AN: What business do the Iranis who close their restaurants do after selling the premises which are invariably on prime locations? AA: They go back to Iran. There is no future for us here. Even those Iranis who were born here have not been given Pakistani nationalities. AN: How come Khairabad is a longish-shaped restaurant, unlike others?AA: My grandfather bought a shop and turned it into a tea shop. My father bought two more [which he combined], which is why you get that impression.AN: You have a fast food joint very close to Khairabad. Fast food joints are not your cup of tea. They are different from Irani restaurants. Then there is Ramzani Bakery which is a few steps ahead of Agha Fastfoods.  How will you explain this diversion?AA: We have to keep pace with the changing times. And as for the bakery, may I remind you that bakeries have always been a part of the operations. Many restaurants have bakeries next door.AN: Why does Agha Fastfoods remain closed on Sundays?AA: There are no clients on Sundays and public holidays because this is a commercial area. Even Khairabad has many empty seats on the second half of Saturdays and whole day on Sundays.  \u2014 AN.\nMemories of Avalon\nA regular customer shares memories of his favourite haunt in the 60s\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe traditional bentwood chairs of Irani \u2018hotels\u2019\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nKhan Sahib (not his real name) in his late seventies but his memory of his college days is surprisingly quite sharp. He used to bunk his classes when he was studying for his B.A. For this reason it took him six years after matriculation to complete his graduation, which otherwise he could have done in four years.When I, his junior, approach him for his views on Avalon, the Irani restaurant, where he used to hold his \u2018darbar\u2019, he sounds reluctant. \u201cI shall talk to you only if you promise me that you won\u2019t publish my name because I don\u2019t want my grandchildren to know that their grandpa used to bunk classes,\u201d he lays down just one condition.I recall that there were always some freeloaders who wanted free cups of tea and often \u2018maska bun\u2019 (buttered bun). Khan Sahib, the son of an affluent jeweller, was never short of cash. More than that, he was quite generous and never hesitated to loosen his purse strings.Drifting down memory lane, Khan Sahib says, \u201cAlmost all Irani restaurants were quite spacious but Avalon was perhaps the largest in terms of space. A table in one corner, from where I could watch college girls going to Sind Muslim College and DJ Science College, was unofficially reserved for me. Let me be honest, I never had the guts to talk to them but, on the other hand, I served as Agony Aunt to boys whose \u2018crush\u2019 for girls was never reciprocated.\u201dKhan Sahib further says, \u201cAvalon was a second grade Irani restaurant where readymade tea was served in tea cups. They were never full or else tea would have spilt in saucers. Payments were made at the counter and the waiters were not given tips. However, I did reward them occasionally, which was why I was given what was known as \u2018VIP treatment\u2019. For instance, I was never served tea in a chipped cup. Like other restaurants of their type, they also served what was known as Sulemani Chai, which was light tea, devoid of milk. Green tea came in vogue much later.\u201d Admiring the servers\u2019 memory, Khan Sahib says, \u201cThe waiters would remember what they had served on which table and how much money was to be collected. Surprisingly, when a bearer [as the waiter was called in those days] had to hand over the charge to his successor at the end of his shift, he would tell them how much money was to be paid by every customer. \u201cIn those days one could share a table with a stranger, without bothering to take his permission,\u201d he recalls. My table was an exception. My flashy moustaches \u2014 now no more, thanks to my wife \u2014 kept the intruders away. \u201cTwo notices were displayed prominently on the premises. One instructed the customers to refrain from discussing politics and the other advised them to check with the person manning the counter if he could handle a 10-rupee note, which was equivalent to a present day 1,000-rupee note,\u201d Khan Sahib reminisces.\u201cI wasn\u2019t keen to graduate, but I feel that the examiners were generous when I managed to get pass marks in maths, which was my weakest subject. That was in 1964. A couple of years later when, out of sheer nostalgia, I went to have a cup of tea, I found much to my dismay, that Avalon had been replaced by a bank.

NAB officials harass retired civil servants in cases of corruption that may actually have little to do with them, as the real perpetrators are often too powerful and influential to be perturbed by such ongoing investigations. One recent example is that of former prime minister Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, who has been under investigation for nearly 500 allegedly illegal appointments and corruption at the Gujranwala Electric Power Company. The officers serving at the time \u2014 even those who have retired by now \u2014 are being pressurised to give testimony against him by NAB investigators. Raja Pervaiz Ashraf, however, does not appear to care. The question is: which civil servants have it in them to defy the chief executive\u2019s orders and continue to serve? Do the names Muhammad Ali Nekokara or Mushtaq Rizvi ring a bell? They bore the brunt for not following orders blindly. Are there any examples where defiantly conscientious civil servants were rewarded for their honesty? The system is designed in such a manner that successive governments might reward certain officers for their loyalty, but definitely not for their honesty. Selective accountability by institutions like NAB does nothing more than provide an opportunity for more corruption by allowing access to blackmail.\nCan deserving civil servants survive such a system?\n\nMany of NAB\u2019s senior positions are currently occupied by retired military officers inducted into the organisation during Gen Musharraf\u2019s regime \u2014 the preferred way of military dictators to reward their constituency ie the army. These officers have also been promoted thanks to the manipulation of the  rules and powerful ties, so much so that the requirements for the post of director general have been relaxed to justify the current incumbent \u2014 a former military officer. What this means is that there is less chance for those officers who have been recruited via competitive processes to be promoted. They are expected to work like mules without harbouring any personal ambitions of a promising career. In a recent judgement, the Supreme Court emphasised the need for honest, well-trained investigative officers in NAB as it has been observed that the accused often try to bribe investigation officers and prosecutors with portions of embezzled money so that they can get off scot-free. In my humble opinion, what the apex court has wished for will remain a fantasy unless the anti-corruption body is purged of internal injustices and instances of favouritism.Everything in this country can be reversed except for what the security establishment has done. Take an example. The Punjab highway patrol department is suffering from the paucity of funds and human resources. Out of the almost 500 vehicles used for patrolling, 400 have been driven more than 250,000 kilometres and yet there are no signs of replacing them. Why is such step-motherly treatment being reserved for a department that is in line with Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif\u2019s love for specialised, specific task-oriented departments? The reason for this callousness is the fact that the said department was the brainchild of the PML-Q government, and political vendetta supersedes all other considerations. In contrast, take another example. All of us know about the induction of military officers in the three most sought-after groups in the civil service: the Foreign Service, the Pakistan Administrative Service and the Police Service of Pakistan. Inductions into these ranks are usually based on recommendations from an influential bigwig. Another military dictator, Gen Ziaul Haq, legalised this practice \u2014 and no civilian government has since dared shut this backdoor entry into the Pakistani civil service.There are certain things in life which one simply has to live with and cannot undo. One such thing, for all Pakistan\u2019s citizens, is the dominance of the security apparatus in the political and administrative spheres in one form or another. The PML-N finally seems to have learnt its lesson, as (among other things) is evident from the recent appointment of the military-backed retired Lt Gen Zamir-ul-Hassan Shah in an apparent U-turn. Those NAB officers who are planning to move court against NAB\u2019s appointments of former military officers would save themselves a lot of litigation if they learn from the experiences of none other than the prime minister himself. Lastly, if I dare ask, how would it feel if someone offered help during a natural disaster (such as a flood or an earthquake) but then decided to take over and oversee the running of operations themselves without much input from the concerned parties? I am sure that our security establishment is not going down that road and that this is mostly a case of a few individuals using the institution for trivial personal gains. I hope I am factually correct \u2014 and not just politically correct.

After the end of his physical remand, police reproduced MPA Shiraz Waheed before the court and the administrative judge sent him to prison on judicial remand and asked the police to file an investigation report. According to the FIR, the MPA along with his 15 absconding accomplices was allegedly distributing CDs, which contained speeches and statements to wage war or attempt or abet to wage war against the country, among the people in Ahsanabad. Police claimed that they found 32 such CDs in the custody of the MPA at the time of his arrest on Aug 25. The case was registered under Sections 120-B (criminal conspiracy), 121 (waging or attempting to wage war or abetting waging of war against Pakistan), 123-A, 124-A and 109 of the Pakistan Penal Code read with Section 7 of the Anti-Terrorism Act, 1997 at the SITE Superhighway Industrial Area police station. Identification parades Some witnesses picked out on Tuesday 26 suspects during identification parades before a judicial magistrate in two cases pertaining to sedition, anti-state offences and attack on media houses. Three Muttahida Qaumi Movement leaders with around 40 workers, including three women, are in police custody on physical remand pertaining to Aug 22 incidents following a highly-provocative speech of their London-based chief. Police produced the detained activists before a judicial magistrate (south) for identification parades while three witnesses turned up to identify them. The judicial sources said that the witnesses rightly picked out 26 suspects among the dummies and assigned their roles in the commissioning of the alleged offences. They were booked in two cases registered at the Artillery Madian police station under multiple charges, including sedition and offences against the state. Suspect indicted in KESC chief murder case An antiterrorism court indicted on Tuesday a suspect in a 1997 triple murder case. Mohammed Minhaj Qazi, alias Asad, along with his accomplices has been booked in the murder case of the then managing director of the Karachi Electric Supply Company Malik Shahid Hamid, his driver, and a guard in the Defence Housing Authority in 1997. The ATC-V judge, Mohammed Javed Alam, read out the charges. However, the accused pleaded not guilty and opted to contest the case. The court summoned the prosecution witnesses with the direction to record their evidence on Sept 26. Police in a supplementary investigation report chargesheeted Qazi as one of the alleged shooters, adding that he and Saulat Mirza along with their two other accomplices had fired at the car of the MD of the KESC with Kalashnikov assault rifles. They also named MQM chief Altaf Hussain, the party convener Nadeem Nusrat, a London-based leader Sohail Zaidi and two workers, Rashid Akhtar and Athar Hussain as absconders in the charge sheet and on a previous hearing, the court declared them proclaimed offenders.

Mr Mahmood, the chairman of the board of governors of the Institute of Strategic Studies (ISSI), was speaking at a talk on \u2018Climate Change, Nuclear Disarmament and Humane Global Governance\u2019 at the institute.He said climate change is intimately linked to the disastrous impact of nuclear weapons. In the 1980s, several studies were carried out on how the use of nuclear weapons and \u2018nuclear clouds\u2019 would impact climate change. \u201cIn this context, we need a global governance system in order to avert any such scenario where nuclear weapons are used,\u201d he said. Guest speaker Prof Dr Richard Anderson Falk, professor emeritus of International Law and Princeton University and former UNHRC special rapporteur on Palestine, said the topic was an overarching subject and highlighted the shortcomings of the international arrangement that caters to existential threats to humanity. He said problems between states were solved in a few basic ways \u2013 including through a multilateral consensus among states to serve humanity. However, Dr Falk added that the international system or structure does not have the adequate qualities or the framework to uphold these global values. \u201cThe best it could do was what happened in the Paris agreement,\u201d he said, adding that the government should take responsibility either of who generates these problems or who solves them. He said one of the problematic aspects of climate change is the degree of harm caused by it, which is concentrated and affecting communities who are not responsible for generating the problem. Dr Falk also emphasised the failure of the United Nations system to provide a plan and approach to solving common challenges to humanity. Another guest speaker, Dr Hilal Elver, a research professor and global distinguished fellow at the University of California Santa Barbara LA Law School, posed questions on the difference between human and humane global governance. \u201cThe fear factor is very important in mobilising societies to force their governments, and this fear which regards to nuclear weapons and climate change is one stark distinction.\u201dShe added that the global economy, corporate interest and the private section were not very important factors in nuclear disarmament, but were in the climate change scenario. She said that while the concept of security during the Cold War was based on territorial defence, that has now changed to human security \u2013 which is the human part of global governance and security.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "A Reporter", "title": "Climate change linked to nuclear weapons\u2019 impact"}}

It also wants retailers to be stopped from putting tobacco advertisements inside their shops as they could entice the youth.\nParliamentarians argue tobacco companies contribute to economy\n\nAccording to the bill, tobacco companies will not be allowed to sponsor health camps, plantation campaigns and sport and other events.During the meeting, a representative of the All Pakistan Cigarette Retailer Association, Haji Mohammad Yousuf, said retailers will lose their identity if advertisements for tobacco companies were banned.\u201cBusiness for smuggled cigarettes will increase which will also cause the state financial loss. Shops will also not be renovated by tobacco companies as they are now,\u201d he argued.PTI Senator Nauman Wazir Khattak said that some NGOs were working against the tobacco industry, which is contributing Rs135 billion in tax revenues to the country\u2019s economy.Senator Khattak explained that 99pc of Rs135 billion in taxes is paid by two tobacco companies which have a 65pc share of the tobacco market and the rest of the companies which make up for 35pc of the market pay 1pc of the taxes.He suggested that a meeting between major tobacco companies, the Federal Board of Revenue and the committee be arranged.The PTI senator then asked how some cigarettes were being sold for Rs26 when the minimum tax on 20 cigarettes was Rs44. He declared the bill \u2018discriminatory\u2019 and said it was drafted by NGOs and will allow for easily pressuring tobacco companies.Senator Ayesha Raza Farooq, who is the prime minister focal person on polio and also works on health issues, was also not in favour of the bill. She argued that NGOs claims of children noticing advertisements is vague and said that this in does not prove that they take up smoking due to the advertisements. She said laws already exist for this problem and that awareness campaigns should be launched instead of making new legislation.This was seconded by Dr Ashok Kumar, who belongs to the National Party. He also said NGOs should launch an awareness campaign instead of trying for new legislation.\u201cKhyber Pakhtunkhwa is affected by terrorism and if people were stopped from growing tobacco, they will have nothing to do. The smaller provinces are affected by measures like these,\u201d he said,MQM Senator Ateeq Sheikh also said that laws against tobacco already exist and that there is no need for making new laws.PML-N Senator Kalsoom Parveen said that the people who used to grow poppies before were told to grow tobacco and that they should not be stopped from this now.The chairman of the committee then said that instead of trying to stop tobacco companies, they should be encouraged to participate in health care activities.Secretary of the NHS ministry, Ayub Sheikh tried defending the bill and referred to data which said that 300 people die each day of tobacco related illnesses. However, other members including Dr Kumar asked him to show proof for the authenticity of the data and asked for the same to be submitted in the committee.Mr Sheikh said that the aim of the bill was to ensure that the new generation is not enticed by tobacco advertisements.\u201cEvery day 1,200 children of between the ages of 12 and 15 take up smoking and non-communicable diseases are increasing across the country. It is a fact that children are affected by tobacco advertisements,\u2019 he added.And though the committee allowed a representative of tobacco retailers to present his arguments, Nadeem Iqbal, the head of The Network for Consumer Protection which is the NGO which had assisted in drafting the bill, was not allowed to make his case.NHS Minister Saira Afzal Tarar, who was late to the meeting, suggested the matter be referred to the sub-committee after which it was decided that a sub-committee headed by Senator Nauman Wazir will be formed for the purpose.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Ikram Junaidi", "title": "Senators oppose bill to ban tobacco advertisements"}}

The Pakistan captain praised Alex Hales, who smashed an England record 171, and Jos Buttler\u2019s blistering unbeaten 90. \u201cIt was an exceptional innings from Alex Hales and Jos Buttler,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think 444 is a bit too much. I think we missed some key chances \u2014 especially that [Wahab Riaz] no-ball when we would have got rid of Hales on 72. \u201cWe didn\u2019t start well, and there\u2019s no excuse for that. Those fielding lapses straightaway didn\u2019t send a good message,\u201d Azhar lamented after Pakistan were dismissed for 275 at Trent Bridge to trail 0-3 in the five-match series. \u201cThe wicket was really good \u2014 lots of runs were in it,\u201d he said. \u201cOnce the batsmen start going, it\u2019s hard to stop them and really needed to support the bowlers and that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d Pakistan were unable to play above the level which has seen them slump to ninth in the world rankings. But Azhar insisted they are capable of better. \u201cI still believe we\u2019re not that bad,\u201d he added. \u201cWe just need to learn quickly \u2014 otherwise we\u2019ll prove ourselves wrong. We need to raise our game.\u201d Meanwhile, Hales does not expect to be an England record-holder for long after scoring the highest individual innings for his country in te format. Hales said it\u2019s just a matter of time before an England colleague betters his score. \u201cI think the improvements we\u2019ve shown in the last couple of years, I\u2019m not sure how long that record will stand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe batting we\u2019ve got all the way down to pretty much number 11 so it\u2019s an exciting time for us as a team.\u201d This was a timely innings for Hales, who had managed just 145 runs at an average of 18.12 during England\u2019s preceding 2-2 Test series with Pakistan. That was followed by meagre scores of seven and 14 in the first two ODIs at Southampton and Lord\u2019s respectively. But back in front of his home crowd, the opener looked a far more confident and authoritative batsman as Robin Smith\u2019s 167 not out against Australia at Edgbaston back in 1993 finally ceased to be England\u2019s highest individual ODI score. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough few weeks personally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Test series didn\u2019t go to plan \u2014 but when it comes to the white ball in the last 12 months, I\u2019ve felt in good form. \u201cI was always confident heading into this series, and it\u2019s nice to put it right.\u201d Jason Roy, Hales\u2019s opening partner had gone close to breaking Smith\u2019s record with 162 against Sri Lanka at The Oval \u2014 his home ground \u2014 in June. \u201cI knew I was I closing in,\u201d said Hales. \u201cWhen I heard the cheer going round the ground I knew something was happening, but at the time I was unaware.\u201d This victory was further evidence of the progress England have made in 50-over cricket since their dismal first-round exit at last year\u2019s World Cup. Hales believes there is better to come from the 2019 World Cup hosts. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting for us as I don\u2019t think we\u2019ve reached our full potential yet.

Speaking at a press conference at the Karachi Press Club on Wednesday, Sindh JUI-F general secretary Rahid Mehmood Soomro, who was accompanied by some other party leaders, described the assassination of Dr Soomro, his father, as one of the worst such incidents in the history of the province. \u201cEver since the incident that occurred in Sukkur on Nov 29, 2014, we have been in touch with the provincial authorities with regard to the arrest and trial of the assassins and their handlers,\u201d Rashid Soomro said, adding that the progress of investigation and prosecution had remained very slow. Despite repeated appeals to the authorities during the long period, the all culprits had not been arrested and prosecuted, he said.

As Dr Alam had also assisted the late Dr Sameja in the operation of a student nurse Nadia on July 16 (who expired on July 17) in the BVH, he too had been admitted to AKUH (along with Dr Sameja) on suspicion of carrying Congo virus. However, Dr Alam was discharged from the hospital after screening and resumed his duty at the BVH.BVH focal persons Dr Aamir Bokhari told Dawn on Wednesday that after showing virus symptoms on July 27, Dr Alam had been quarantined at the BVH and was examined by three professors during his six-hour stay at the hospital.

The POA top echelon must be removed forthwith for this sports decline. People with knowledge and the ability to take forward our sports are needed in the POA. When more freeloaders than the athletes represent us at the Olympics, when our hockey team does not even qualify, when a boxer with potential quits in disgust owing to lack of support, we desperately need a change in POA.Imran SheikhKarachi(2)THIS refers to the Rio Olympics which ended recently. It was disheartening to observe a photograph (Aug 7), showing the smallest ever Pakistan contingent comprising seven athletes. I want to ask the president of the Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) to explain why only seven athletes represented Pakistan at this mega event. Furthermore, there was also a controversy regarding the flag-bearer. This too reflects the casual attitude of the POA. It appears that there is a lack of coordination between the POA and sports associations.I request the prime minister to take notice of this pathetic situation. I doubt this mega event was taken seriously. Similarly, provincial sports ministers must look into this and forward recommendations to the PM so that we may start preparing for next Olympics and other events.R.
