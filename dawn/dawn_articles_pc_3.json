Admittedly, there has been progress on this front. But to achieve the goal of making Pakistan polio-free, the authorities cannot slacken off and must remain vigilant. A six-day sub-national anti-polio campaign is currently under way in Sindh, with a heavy police contingent of some 5,000 men deployed in Karachi alone for the security of the vaccinators. Of course, considering the fact that vaccinators have been murdered in cold blood while on duty, the state cannot afford to take any chances, hence the substantial police presence. To date, 13 polio cases have been reported in the country this year; at this time in 2015 the reported total was 29. Though this figure is far from perfect, it certainly does show an improvement and we hope no further cases are reported in the months ahead.The International Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has also said that Pakistan has made improvements in the polio eradication effort. The monitoring body cites an increase in campaign quality and reduction in the number of missed children as examples of improved performance. However, the goal, it should be remembered, remains total eradication of polio transmission in Pakistan. In parts of the country, such as Fata, transmission has been described as \u2018intense\u2019, while certain regions of Balochistan, as well as Karachi, continue to be classified as high-risk. It is these areas that need the most attention. Officials point out that the involvement of religious and community leaders has helped the campaign in \u2018sensitive\u2019 neighbourhoods, while refusals, particularly in Sindh, have also declined. The campaign needs continued focus, funds and most of all political will in order to succeed. Now, as success seems achievable, the state must put its full weight behind the polio eradication campaign until the disease is wiped out from Pakistan.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Polio eradication drive"}}

Pakistan, however, lacks a formal ecosystem development strategy. With 1.7 million people entering the workforce each year, the primary objective of Pakistan\u2019s ecosystem development strategy is to create jobs, which is also essential for socio-economic stability. The resulting private-sector expansion will support the formation of high-growth firms, stimulate the growth of (SMEs which account for 97pc of all jobs in emerging economies) and promote self-employment opportunities.The ecosystem is a network of institutions and individuals within a defined geographical area representing the different elements of entrepreneurship, shaped by its underlying socio-cultural conditions, with resources that reflect its level of economic development.Historically, Pakistan\u2019s ecosystem development has emphasised capacity building and training, including business plan competitions, incubators and mentorship. And although the State Bank has led successful financial inclusion initiatives, sustainable entrepreneurial-led growth needs to be built on broader macro-level foundations with an initial focus on four areas:\nMSP collaboration is a critical obligation of our business leaders.\n\n\u2022 Entrepreneurship education develops personal skills that are equally beneficial to employers, and promotes the cultural acceptance of entrepreneurship as an alternate and viable career choice. It has three essential features: start at primary school, create a curriculum to identify skills and competencies for each education level, and develop a trained and certified teaching faculty. In the World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) Global Compet\u00aditiveness Index 2015-16, Pakistan ranks 112/140 in quality of education.\u2022 Expanding women\u2019s economic participation to harness the talents and contributions of the under-represented half of the population, and to address gender disparities for women\u2019s economic empowerment, which also corresponds to Goal 5 of the UN\u2019s SDGs. Pakistani women\u2019s population to labour force participation ratio is 23pc (males 86pc) and only 4.8pc of women have accounts at financial institutions (South Asia average 37pc). Pakistan is ranked 141/142 in the WEF Global Gender Gap Report which measures gender equality. Across nine years of annual data from 2006 to 2014, Pakistan\u2019s rank has always been among the bottom three.\u2022 Regulatory reform to catalyse private-sector growth with better business regulations and to improve regulatory processes. Since 2003, the World Bank\u2019s annual Doing Business (DB) reports have become the primary reference and benchmarking tool in 10 areas of business regulation. An analysis of 11 years of DB data has shown that economies implementing regulatory reforms or performing well on DB indicators generate multiple social and economic outcomes including attracting FDI, creating new firms and new jobs and improvements in rule of law. Although Pakistan\u2019s DB rankings have been consistently poor, they have deteriorated from 110/189 in 2014 to 138/189 in 2016.\u2022 Funding and finance for different stages of the business cycle, including seed capital and growth equity, and expanding financial inclusion. In a 2013 survey, Pakistani entrepreneurs rated funding and finance as the least available component of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. With only 13pc of the adult population having an account at a financial institution in 2014 (deve\u00adloping economies ave\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adrage 50pc), these statistics show a low level of financial inclusion and exp\u00adlains the lack of a credit history that blocks financing for Pakistani entrepreneurs.Policy instability has been a significant factor in Pakistan\u2019s inability to develop and implement sustainable growth strategies. Now, however, SDG 17 provides mitigation for past failures by supporting \u201cinclusive partnerships\u201d for \u201ca sustainable development agenda\u201d, and establishes two critical features for implementing the ecosystem development strategy: 1) an industry-neutral institutional platform to drive the agenda and backed by the private sector; 2) multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs) of public- and private-sector businesses, academia and the different component organisations of civil society, collaborating to exchange ideas, developing recommendations, and engaging with government agencies for advocacy.Increasingly, businesses worldwide are integrating MSP collaboration with their corporate citizenship roles because it promotes public participation and transparency in development initiatives. It is a critical obligation for Pakistan\u2019s business leaders to do the same.

{"1281193": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "DAMBULLA: John Hastings claimed six wickets before Aaron Finch and George Bailey\u2019s attacking half-centuries powered Australia to a series clinching six-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the fourth One-day International in Dambulla on Wednesday. Australia rode on Finch\u2019s 19-ball 55 and an unbeaten 90 from Bailey to chase down 213 in 31 overs and take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. Earlier Hastings\u2019 career-best bowling figures of 6-45 helped bowl out Sri Lanka for 212 after electing to bat first despite Dhananjaya de Silva\u2019s fighting 76 at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium. In reply, Finch\u2019s opening blitz gave Australia a rocket start against a Sri Lankan attack that missed skipper Angelo Mathews\u2019 medium pace after the all-rounder hurt his calf while batting. Finch, who equalled the record for the fastest fifty \u2014 in 18 balls \u2014 by an Australian, struck eight fours and three sixes as he carted the Sri Lankan spinners to all parts of the ground. Left-arm spinner Sachith Pathirana\u2019s triple strike in the space of five deliveries checked the visitors\u2019 surge but only for a brief while. Pathirana got the wickets of danger man Finch and Usman Khawaja for nought in his opening over of the innings. He then bowled skipper David Warner for 19 on the first ball of his next over. Bailey, who registered his 21st ODI fifty, carried the momentum forward as he anchored Australia\u2019s chase with his 85-ball knock, laced with 11 fours and a six. He got the perfect partner in Travis Head, who scored 40, as the duo put on 100 runs for the fourth wicket. Head was trapped lbw off Dilruwan Perera but Matthew Wade, who remained unbeaten on eight, joined Bailey at the crease to hit the winning six. The victory comes as a welcome relief for the visiting side after they suffered their first series whitewash against Sri Lanka in the three Test matches. Sri Lanka suffered from a lack of partnerships as their innings ran out of steam as they folded on the last ball of the 50th over. Australia\u2019s pace spearhead Mitchell Starc struck in the very first over to have debutant batsman Avishka Fernando trapped lbw for nought. Man-of-the-match Hastings soon got Kusal Mendis caught behind for one. The on-field umpire gave the batsman not out before Australia successfully reviewed the decision. Scott Boland, who replaced Josh Hazlewood in the starting XI, joined the pace charge to dismiss previous match centurion Dinesh Chandimal \u2014 caught behind to leave Sri Lanka reeling on 31-3. De Silva and Mathews then started a rebuilding act, mixing caution and aggression against a persistent Australian attack. Mathews, who was badly shaken after being hit on the back of his helmet off a Boland bouncer, made a gritty 28 before retiring hurt with a calf injury that hampered his footwork and running between the wickets. De Silva, whose maiden ODI half-century included nine boundaries, looked a little edgy after Mathews\u2019 departure and soon departed after spooning a catch to mid-wicket off Hastings. Australia\u2019s spinners then got in on the act as Adam Zampa and Head took two more wickets to land Sri Lanka in deeper trouble. Pathirana chipped in with a crucial 24-run cameo to help Sri Lanka pass the 200-run mark from a precarious 165-7. Hastings\u2019 double strike in the 48th over brought him his maiden five-wicket haul in ODIs. A limping Mathews, who scored a gutsy 40, returned to bat in that same over to add some useful runs to the total, which in the end proved insufficient for the rampaging visitors.

They found the dogs would activate an area of the right brain to distinguish between intonation signaling kindness and neutral tones. The researchers had already identified that the same part of dogs\u2019 brains interprets non-verbal sounds that elicit emotions. The same area of the human brain plays a similar role, suggesting that the mechanisms for interpreting intonation aren\u2019t specific to speech. \u201cWhat makes words uniquely human is not a special neural capacity, but our invention of using them,\u201d the scientists said.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Dogs, like humans, distinguish words and intonation"}}

Admittedly, there has been progress on this front. But to achieve the goal of making Pakistan polio-free, the authorities cannot slacken off and must remain vigilant. A six-day sub-national anti-polio campaign is currently under way in Sindh, with a heavy police contingent of some 5,000 men deployed in Karachi alone for the security of the vaccinators. Of course, considering the fact that vaccinators have been murdered in cold blood while on duty, the state cannot afford to take any chances, hence the substantial police presence. To date, 13 polio cases have been reported in the country this year; at this time in 2015 the reported total was 29. Though this figure is far from perfect, it certainly does show an improvement and we hope no further cases are reported in the months ahead.The International Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has also said that Pakistan has made improvements in the polio eradication effort. The monitoring body cites an increase in campaign quality and reduction in the number of missed children as examples of improved performance. However, the goal, it should be remembered, remains total eradication of polio transmission in Pakistan. In parts of the country, such as Fata, transmission has been described as \u2018intense\u2019, while certain regions of Balochistan, as well as Karachi, continue to be classified as high-risk. It is these areas that need the most attention. Officials point out that the involvement of religious and community leaders has helped the campaign in \u2018sensitive\u2019 neighbourhoods, while refusals, particularly in Sindh, have also declined. The campaign needs continued focus, funds and most of all political will in order to succeed. Now, as success seems achievable, the state must put its full weight behind the polio eradication campaign until the disease is wiped out from Pakistan.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Polio eradication drive"}}

Based on the life of Bulleh Shah, the play was written by Shahid Nadeem and directed by Madeeha Gauhar. First performed in 2001, the play highlighted Bulleh Shah\u2019s journey to becoming a respected scholar and his longing for true inner realisation. Against the objections of his peers, Bulleh Shah became a disciple of Shah Inayat \u2013 a famous master of the Qadri Sufi lineage \u2013 who ultimately guided his student to his mystical awakening.Starting off with the death of Bulleh Shah, also known as Abdullah Shah Qadri, and the controversy around his burial, the life and times of the 16th century Syed, who became a discipline of Shah Inayat Qadri \u2013 an eminent saint who happened to be an Arian - unfolded. Punctuated with Bulleh Shah\u2019s poetry, the play was performed remarkably by the troupe. The addition of Bulleh Shah\u2019s poetry to the script, and the idea to tell the story with the help of two narrators were an effective way to avoid monotonous dialogue. Bulleh Shah was played by Usman Raaj, who also recited his poems beautifully. The Khawer Ali Qawwal group performed qawwalis on Bulleh Shah\u2019s poetry. The play focused on Bulleh Shah as a symbol of hope and humanism, and a powerful voice for tolerance and love. He promoted a relationship with God that was not oppressive, and allowed people to be religious and also respect other people\u2019s beliefs. He did not see any conflict between his spiritual beliefs and his devotion to music and dance. The playwright also presented two strategies to confront the tyranny of rulers. While historically inaccurate, the fictional meeting of two Punjabi icons, Bulleh Shah and Banda Singh Bahadur (a Sikh warrior who stood against the Mughals) highlighted two separate but contemporary perspectives. Their meeting in the play signifies their divergent world views. Where Banda Singh Bahadur believed in bloodshed and taking revenge with violence, Bulleh Shah upheld a spiritual ideology about peace and justice. Introducing \u2018Bullah\u2019 to the audience, Shahid Nadeem, the playwright, said the play was broadly based on events in Bulleh Shah\u2019s life \u2013 communicated through poetry, historical records and popular myths \u2013 and was ultimately a tribute to the great mystic. \u201cBulleh Shah lived in the time of the downfall of the Mughal Empire, characterised by conflict, rebellion, religious and civil strife and absolute ideological and political chaos. Those times were not very different from today,\u201d he said. After the play was over, Sabiha Umer, an audience member, told Dawn: \u201cBefore watching this play I didn\u2019t know about the life of Bulleh Shah.\u201d She had been shocked by the opening scene, where rulers refused to bury Bulleh Shah in his hometown. \u201cIt was an injustice to such a great personality, but time proved who was on the right path.\u201d\u201cSuch plays should be performed on a regular basis and also in educational institutions to raise awareness among youngsters about our rich culture and history,\u201d she added.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Asma Kundi", "title": "Bullah marks iconic Sufi poet\u2019s urs"}}

PPP Senator Farhatullah Babar informed the committee that the privilege motion notice had been submitted by him. \nThe lawmaker said he had searched for the international human rights organisation and called people in Pakistan, India and Nepal who said the body \u201cHuman Rights Commission South Asia\u201d did not exist. \u201cAll individuals [had] disassociated themselves from the fake organisation,\u201d Mr Babar said. \nPPP senator says the HR body whose report was quoted by the paramilitary force does not exist\n\n\u201cThe Human Rights Commission South Asia seems to be a bogus organisation created primarily by the vested interests for propaganda purpose,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe submission of the report of a bogus organisation to defend the human rights record of a law enforcement agency has only undermined its own credibility\u201d. During a meeting of the committee in July, Col Qaiser Khattaq, who is said to be overseeing the Karachi operation, said that an international human rights organisation had endorsed the operation. Mr Babar had challenged the Rangers\u2019 claim and asked Col Khattaq to submit a copy of the report in the committee\u2019s next meeting. However, when the committee met on Wednesday, representatives from Pakistan Rangers were absent. In a letter to the committee, the Rangers said its representatives would not be available until November \u201cdue to prevailing law and order situation of the Metropolitan city\u201d. The committee rejected the Rangers\u2019 explanation. \u201cWe want the law enforcement agency to answer for misleading parliament by quoting the report of a non-existing fictional international human rights body,\u201d said Mr Babar, adding that the credibility of Pakistan Rangers had been stained because of this move. The committee was unanimous in expressing concern over the continued absence of Rangers representatives from the meetings and demanded their presence at the next meeting. \u201cThere is no justification whatsoever for the Rangers\u2019 absence,\u201d said Mohsin Leghari, adding that it only gave a bad name to the institution. However, PML-N Senator Nisar Muhammad defended the operation. \u201cKarachi is a changed city only because of Rangers,\u201d he said. Dumped bodies\nThe committee took several decisions pertaining to the killing of people and dumping of bodies in Balochistan over the past two years. It recommended DNA tests of all such bodies and reiterated its call for adoption of draft legislation to \u201crein in state agencies\u201d. The debate was triggered when Quetta\u2019s DIG Crimes Shakeel Ahmed Durrani informed the meeting that 52 bodies had been found dumped in \u2018A areas\u2019 of Balochistan over the past two years. The meeting learnt that cases were not being investigated as no-one had come forward to lodge a report with the police. While local police were in charge of \u2018A areas\u2019, their jurisdiction ended in \u2018B areas\u2019 which came under the jurisdiction of Frontier Corps, the committee was informed. Mr Babar said the admission that no-one had lodged a report with the police was stinging indictment of state institutions. \u201cThis is a vote of no-confidence in the state machinery and the system of justice,\u201d said Mr Babar while warning against consequences of state apathy towards the plight of the people of Balochistan. He said the report of dumping of mutilated bodies was highly alarming as figures pertained only to \u2018A areas\u2019 where police were deployed. \u201cGod alone knows how many bodies of unfortunate victims were found dumped in \u2018B areas\u2019 of Balochistan,\u201d the senator said and demanded a complete report on the \u201ckilling and dumping cases\u201d in all areas of the province year-wise at the next meeting. On the advice of the chairman of the National Commission of Human Rights, retired Justice Ali Nawaz Chowhan, the committee decided to seek copies of the FIRs lodged by the state in cases of those whose bodies had been found dumped.

Wouldn\u2019t that be a decision you would like to rethink considering villains hardly change and remain on the other side of the law for most of the time. Suicide Squad tells you that too many negatives can result in a positive because here, antiheroes work for the government and manage to do a fine job as well.Director David Ayer\u2019s Suicide Squad revolves around some of the \u2018baddest\u2019 villains in the DC Universe; on one hand they don\u2019t have anything in common whereas on the other, they all are more alike than different. Deadshot (Will Smith) is an expert marksman who doesn\u2019t miss; Harley Quinn (Margot Robbie) plays a crazily calculated lunatic while Captain Boomerang (Jai Courtney), El Diablo (Jay Hernandez) and Killer Croc (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje) have powers of their own. Government agent Amanda Waller (Viola Davis) brings them together to bring down the Enchantress (Cara Delevingne) who is on a rampage and wants to take control of the world for her evil gains. And then there is Joker (Jared Leto) who wants to break his lady love out of the prison one way or the other. Suicide Squad is laced with witty dialogues and excellent action sequences that will bring you to the edge of your seat; watching so many antiheroes in action is a new thing, considering not even Marvel has been able to do that in its 40-odd films. The story takes place after the death of Superman in Dawn of Justice because that\u2019s when these bad guys are needed the most; the \u2018Squad\u2019 stands together because it has nothing to lose and that gives them the edge over their opponents.Will Smith, Margot Robbie and Jared Leto are the stars of the movie as they have the margin to perform and also portray their famous characters according to the comics, with minor changes. There is a cameo appearance by Batman (Ben Affleck) as well and he makes his mark. The Flash and Aquaman also appear briefly but their cameos don\u2019t mean much. The best thing this flick does for the fans of DC Comics is give them a glimpse into what\u2019s cooking because Justice League is around the corner. The movie is PG-13.

Consumers too now realise they are buying lighter weight animals every year but paying higher prices.A major reason for the price hike of sacrificial animals in the past few years is the influx of small and big investors who are in for quick profits.Cows leadSacrificing cows appears more popular in Karachi while goats are preferred in other parts of the country.According to the Pakistan Economic Survey 2015-16, goat production increased to 77.8m in 2015-16 from 68.4m in 2014-15 and 66.6m in 2013-14.Cattle production rose to 42.8m in 2015-16 from 41.2m in 2013-14 and 39.7m in 2013-14, followed by 36.6m buffalo production in 2015-16 as compared to 35.6m in 2014-15 and 34.6m in 2013-14.Despite increasing cattle production trend, profiteers have forced beef and goat meat prices up by Rs20-50 per kilogram every year.When questioned, traders gave the rhetorical response of increasing prices due to meat exports and smuggling of live animals resulting in shortage of animals.Beef production hit 2.02m tonnes in 2015-16 from 1.95m tonnes in 2014-15 and 1.89m tonnes in 2013-14.Mutton production went up to 686,000 tonnes in 2015-16 as compared to 671,000 tonnes in 2014-15 and 657,000 tonnes in 2013-14.Export of meat and its products stood at 76,448 tonnes fetching $269m in 2015-16 as compared to 74,758 tonnes ($243m) in 2014-15 and 73,664 tonnes ($229m) in 2013-14, according to the Pakistan Bureau of Statistics (PBS).Hides and skinsTanners expect a sharp fall in the prices of raw hides and skin due to declining price trend of these items in the international markets and a slump in leather goods demand.Last year, tanners estimated total value of qurbani hides and skins at Rs6bn to Rs7bn. But this year they anticipate Rs3bn to Rs4bn only.PTA Chairman Gulzar Feroz said that a total of 7.3m hides and skins were collected last year. \u201cThis year the volume of hides and skin collection may remain same as of last year. However, unlike last year, when the maximum price of cow/buffalo hide was Rs2,000 each, this year it may range between Rs1,000-1,200 per hide,\u201d he added.Similarly, the price of goat skin is expected to hover between Rs100-125 per skin as compared to Rs175-225. Sheep skin price may range between Rs70-90 per skin this year as compared to Rs125-175 per skin last year.He said that due to poor purchasing and improper curing, a large number of hides and skins get damaged every year.Mr Feroz said that globally raw material prices are very low and demand is thin. In UK, sheep skin was available at four pounds last year as compared to one pound this year, he added.Synthetic material is taking over leather due to price difference. Jackets made of synthetic material are priced at $20 per jacket as compared to $50 for leather jacket.The PTA chief said that overall there is a 30 per cent decline in demand for skin and hides while demand for leather-related items is facing a 20pc slump this year in world markets.According to PBS data, Pakistan\u2019s leather exports started off with a bad note in the current fiscal \u2014 only $40m in July 2016 \u2014 as compared to $50m in July 2015.In 2015-16, leather exports fell to $526m as compared to $597m in 2014-15.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Aamir Shafaat Khan", "title": "Billions to be spent on sacrificial animals in Pakistan"}}

In a meeting on Wednesday, the PAC admitted its weakness during a briefing of Employees Old-Age Benefit Institution (EOBI) chairman Sualeh Farooqui, when a lawmaker asked Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) Rana Assad Amin why the EOBI\u2019s case was not reported to the PAC in 2012, when the irregularities were being committed. The AGP told the PAC that auditors had raised audit objections in their 2012, 2013 and 2014 reports, but the PAC did not take up the reports in a timely manner. \nAt existing strength, PAC incapable of handling mega-corruption cases, acting against embezzlers\n\nThe AGP also pointed out a flaw in the existing audit mechanism, saying under its laws the audit office has to submit audit reports of all ministries to the president by the end of every year. The president then forwards these reports to parliament, after which they come to the PAC for discussion. He said this procedure takes months, and since the PAC is already clearing an existing backlog, the committee cannot take up these reports in a timely fashion. \u201cI have also proposed amendments to the Auditor General of Pakistan Ordinance, which would enable the audit authorities to send certain audit reports to the president without waiting until the year\u2019s end,\u201d he said. The committee would subsequently take up these matters immediately. Under the existing system, audit reports are tabled before the PAC after a gap of three to four years. \u201cBut, for this practice it is necessary that the PAC clear its backlog,\u201d the AGP added. Despite being the apex accountability forum in the country \u2013 superior to forums such as the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) and the Federal Investigation Agency (FIA) \u2013 the PAC, practically, cannot take action against any official accused of embezzling billions of rupees, PAC chairman Mr Shah said. \u201cThe only thing we can do is scold the delinquent officials. At most, the committee can send them to jail for three months,\u201d he added. Criticising consecutive stay orders on nearly all matters related to important audit paras, which restrain the committee from proceeding against corrupt officials and private parties, Mr Shah said the committee becomes helpless when a civil judge issued a stay order in a matter being discussed by the PAC. The PAC has, on a number of occasions, deferred discussions on audit paras after being told the matter in question was sub judice. Recently, the committee stopped debating a case regarding the status of an industrial plot after it was informed that the officials responsible had obtained a stay order from the court. He said there should be a distinction between the PAC\u2019s domain and that of the civil courts, and legislation was needed to stop overstepping into the other\u2019s jurisdiction. Mr Shah suggested that the committee have its own secretariat, workforce and related staff to deal with urgent cases. He claimed that the committee has recovered Rs119 billion in the last three years, with a staff of 30 individuals. He said the recovered sum should have been much higher had the committee been provided adequate resources. \u201cThe PAC will meet the speaker to discuss the establishment of its secretariat and amending the PAC terms of reference,\u201d he said. Civil society activists have also called for the empowerment of otherwise \u201ccosmetic\u201d parliamentary committees for effective executive oversight. Free and Fair Election Network (Fafen) representative Mudassir Rizvi told Dawn that while it claims to be a supreme institution, the parliament is no such things. Subsequently, parliamentary committees like the PAC are also toothless, but take cosmetic measures to pretend they are powerful bodies.He said in the United States parliamentary committees pass binding directions and the executive implements them. \nIn Pakistan, the PAC \u2013 or any other parliamentary committee \u2013 cannot issue directions, but sends recommendations to the relevant quarters which are not binding. He said committees are also dominant in India. A parliamentary panel can summon a minister in certain cases, which is why the executive takes their recommendations seriously. He said parliamentary committees need to be strengthened and empowered to deal with matters of public interest with full authority.

Pakistan, however, lacks a formal ecosystem development strategy. With 1.7 million people entering the workforce each year, the primary objective of Pakistan\u2019s ecosystem development strategy is to create jobs, which is also essential for socio-economic stability. The resulting private-sector expansion will support the formation of high-growth firms, stimulate the growth of (SMEs which account for 97pc of all jobs in emerging economies) and promote self-employment opportunities.The ecosystem is a network of institutions and individuals within a defined geographical area representing the different elements of entrepreneurship, shaped by its underlying socio-cultural conditions, with resources that reflect its level of economic development.Historically, Pakistan\u2019s ecosystem development has emphasised capacity building and training, including business plan competitions, incubators and mentorship. And although the State Bank has led successful financial inclusion initiatives, sustainable entrepreneurial-led growth needs to be built on broader macro-level foundations with an initial focus on four areas:\nMSP collaboration is a critical obligation of our business leaders.\n\n\u2022 Entrepreneurship education develops personal skills that are equally beneficial to employers, and promotes the cultural acceptance of entrepreneurship as an alternate and viable career choice. It has three essential features: start at primary school, create a curriculum to identify skills and competencies for each education level, and develop a trained and certified teaching faculty.
