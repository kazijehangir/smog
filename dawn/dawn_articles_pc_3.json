Admittedly, there has been progress on this front. But to achieve the goal of making Pakistan polio-free, the authorities cannot slacken off and must remain vigilant. A six-day sub-national anti-polio campaign is currently under way in Sindh, with a heavy police contingent of some 5,000 men deployed in Karachi alone for the security of the vaccinators. Of course, considering the fact that vaccinators have been murdered in cold blood while on duty, the state cannot afford to take any chances, hence the substantial police presence. To date, 13 polio cases have been reported in the country this year; at this time in 2015 the reported total was 29. Though this figure is far from perfect, it certainly does show an improvement and we hope no further cases are reported in the months ahead.The International Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has also said that Pakistan has made improvements in the polio eradication effort. The monitoring body cites an increase in campaign quality and reduction in the number of missed children as examples of improved performance. However, the goal, it should be remembered, remains total eradication of polio transmission in Pakistan. In parts of the country, such as Fata, transmission has been described as \u2018intense\u2019, while certain regions of Balochistan, as well as Karachi, continue to be classified as high-risk. It is these areas that need the most attention. Officials point out that the involvement of religious and community leaders has helped the campaign in \u2018sensitive\u2019 neighbourhoods, while refusals, particularly in Sindh, have also declined. The campaign needs continued focus, funds and most of all political will in order to succeed. Now, as success seems achievable, the state must put its full weight behind the polio eradication campaign until the disease is wiped out from Pakistan.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Polio eradication drive"}}

Pakistan, however, lacks a formal ecosystem development strategy. With 1.7 million people entering the workforce each year, the primary objective of Pakistan\u2019s ecosystem development strategy is to create jobs, which is also essential for socio-economic stability. The resulting private-sector expansion will support the formation of high-growth firms, stimulate the growth of (SMEs which account for 97pc of all jobs in emerging economies) and promote self-employment opportunities.The ecosystem is a network of institutions and individuals within a defined geographical area representing the different elements of entrepreneurship, shaped by its underlying socio-cultural conditions, with resources that reflect its level of economic development.Historically, Pakistan\u2019s ecosystem development has emphasised capacity building and training, including business plan competitions, incubators and mentorship. And although the State Bank has led successful financial inclusion initiatives, sustainable entrepreneurial-led growth needs to be built on broader macro-level foundations with an initial focus on four areas:\nMSP collaboration is a critical obligation of our business leaders.\n\n\u2022 Entrepreneurship education develops personal skills that are equally beneficial to employers, and promotes the cultural acceptance of entrepreneurship as an alternate and viable career choice. It has three essential features: start at primary school, create a curriculum to identify skills and competencies for each education level, and develop a trained and certified teaching faculty. In the World Economic Forum\u2019s (WEF) Global Compet\u00aditiveness Index 2015-16, Pakistan ranks 112/140 in quality of education.\u2022 Expanding women\u2019s economic participation to harness the talents and contributions of the under-represented half of the population, and to address gender disparities for women\u2019s economic empowerment, which also corresponds to Goal 5 of the UN\u2019s SDGs. Pakistani women\u2019s population to labour force participation ratio is 23pc (males 86pc) and only 4.8pc of women have accounts at financial institutions (South Asia average 37pc). Pakistan is ranked 141/142 in the WEF Global Gender Gap Report which measures gender equality. Across nine years of annual data from 2006 to 2014, Pakistan\u2019s rank has always been among the bottom three.\u2022 Regulatory reform to catalyse private-sector growth with better business regulations and to improve regulatory processes. Since 2003, the World Bank\u2019s annual Doing Business (DB) reports have become the primary reference and benchmarking tool in 10 areas of business regulation. An analysis of 11 years of DB data has shown that economies implementing regulatory reforms or performing well on DB indicators generate multiple social and economic outcomes including attracting FDI, creating new firms and new jobs and improvements in rule of law. Although Pakistan\u2019s DB rankings have been consistently poor, they have deteriorated from 110/189 in 2014 to 138/189 in 2016.\u2022 Funding and finance for different stages of the business cycle, including seed capital and growth equity, and expanding financial inclusion. In a 2013 survey, Pakistani entrepreneurs rated funding and finance as the least available component of the entrepreneurial ecosystem. With only 13pc of the adult population having an account at a financial institution in 2014 (deve\u00adloping economies ave\u00ad\u00ad\u00ad\u00adrage 50pc), these statistics show a low level of financial inclusion and exp\u00adlains the lack of a credit history that blocks financing for Pakistani entrepreneurs.Policy instability has been a significant factor in Pakistan\u2019s inability to develop and implement sustainable growth strategies. Now, however, SDG 17 provides mitigation for past failures by supporting \u201cinclusive partnerships\u201d for \u201ca sustainable development agenda\u201d, and establishes two critical features for implementing the ecosystem development strategy: 1) an industry-neutral institutional platform to drive the agenda and backed by the private sector; 2) multi-stakeholder partnerships (MSPs) of public- and private-sector businesses, academia and the different component organisations of civil society, collaborating to exchange ideas, developing recommendations, and engaging with government agencies for advocacy.Increasingly, businesses worldwide are integrating MSP collaboration with their corporate citizenship roles because it promotes public participation and transparency in development initiatives. It is a critical obligation for Pakistan\u2019s business leaders to do the same.

{"1281193": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "DAMBULLA: John Hastings claimed six wickets before Aaron Finch and George Bailey\u2019s attacking half-centuries powered Australia to a series clinching six-wicket win over Sri Lanka in the fourth One-day International in Dambulla on Wednesday. Australia rode on Finch\u2019s 19-ball 55 and an unbeaten 90 from Bailey to chase down 213 in 31 overs and take an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. Earlier Hastings\u2019 career-best bowling figures of 6-45 helped bowl out Sri Lanka for 212 after electing to bat first despite Dhananjaya de Silva\u2019s fighting 76 at the Rangiri Dambulla International Stadium. In reply, Finch\u2019s opening blitz gave Australia a rocket start against a Sri Lankan attack that missed skipper Angelo Mathews\u2019 medium pace after the all-rounder hurt his calf while batting. Finch, who equalled the record for the fastest fifty \u2014 in 18 balls \u2014 by an Australian, struck eight fours and three sixes as he carted the Sri Lankan spinners to all parts of the ground. Left-arm spinner Sachith Pathirana\u2019s triple strike in the space of five deliveries checked the visitors\u2019 surge but only for a brief while. Pathirana got the wickets of danger man Finch and Usman Khawaja for nought in his opening over of the innings. He then bowled skipper David Warner for 19 on the first ball of his next over. Bailey, who registered his 21st ODI fifty, carried the momentum forward as he anchored Australia\u2019s chase with his 85-ball knock, laced with 11 fours and a six. He got the perfect partner in Travis Head, who scored 40, as the duo put on 100 runs for the fourth wicket. Head was trapped lbw off Dilruwan Perera but Matthew Wade, who remained unbeaten on eight, joined Bailey at the crease to hit the winning six. The victory comes as a welcome relief for the visiting side after they suffered their first series whitewash against Sri Lanka in the three Test matches. Sri Lanka suffered from a lack of partnerships as their innings ran out of steam as they folded on the last ball of the 50th over. Australia\u2019s pace spearhead Mitchell Starc struck in the very first over to have debutant batsman Avishka Fernando trapped lbw for nought. Man-of-the-match Hastings soon got Kusal Mendis caught behind for one. The on-field umpire gave the batsman not out before Australia successfully reviewed the decision. Scott Boland, who replaced Josh Hazlewood in the starting XI, joined the pace charge to dismiss previous match centurion Dinesh Chandimal \u2014 caught behind to leave Sri Lanka reeling on 31-3. De Silva and Mathews then started a rebuilding act, mixing caution and aggression against a persistent Australian attack. Mathews, who was badly shaken after being hit on the back of his helmet off a Boland bouncer, made a gritty 28 before retiring hurt with a calf injury that hampered his footwork and running between the wickets. De Silva, whose maiden ODI half-century included nine boundaries, looked a little edgy after Mathews\u2019 departure and soon departed after spooning a catch to mid-wicket off Hastings. Australia\u2019s spinners then got in on the act as Adam Zampa and Head took two more wickets to land Sri Lanka in deeper trouble. Pathirana chipped in with a crucial 24-run cameo to help Sri Lanka pass the 200-run mark from a precarious 165-7. Hastings\u2019 double strike in the 48th over brought him his maiden five-wicket haul in ODIs. A limping Mathews, who scored a gutsy 40, returned to bat in that same over to add some useful runs to the total, which in the end proved insufficient for the rampaging visitors.

They found the dogs would activate an area of the right brain to distinguish between intonation signaling kindness and neutral tones. The researchers had already identified that the same part of dogs\u2019 brains interprets non-verbal sounds that elicit emotions. The same area of the human brain plays a similar role, suggesting that the mechanisms for interpreting intonation aren\u2019t specific to speech. \u201cWhat makes words uniquely human is not a special neural capacity, but our invention of using them,\u201d the scientists said.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Dogs, like humans, distinguish words and intonation"}}

Admittedly, there has been progress on this front. But to achieve the goal of making Pakistan polio-free, the authorities cannot slacken off and must remain vigilant. A six-day sub-national anti-polio campaign is currently under way in Sindh, with a heavy police contingent of some 5,000 men deployed in Karachi alone for the security of the vaccinators. Of course, considering the fact that vaccinators have been murdered in cold blood while on duty, the state cannot afford to take any chances, hence the substantial police presence. To date, 13 polio cases have been reported in the country this year; at this time in 2015 the reported total was 29. Though this figure is far from perfect, it certainly does show an improvement and we hope no further cases are reported in the months ahead.The International Monitoring Board of the Global Polio Eradication Initiative has also said that Pakistan has made improvements in the polio eradication effort. The monitoring body cites an increase in campaign quality and reduction in the number of missed children as examples of improved performance. However, the goal, it should be remembered, remains total eradication of polio transmission in Pakistan. In parts of the country, such as Fata, transmission has been described as \u2018intense\u2019, while certain regions of Balochistan, as well as Karachi, continue to be classified as high-risk. It is these areas that need the most attention. Officials point out that the involvement of religious and community leaders has helped the campaign in \u2018sensitive\u2019 neighbourhoods, while refusals, particularly in Sindh, have also declined. The campaign needs continued focus, funds and most of all political will in order to succeed. Now, as success seems achievable, the state must put its full weight behind the polio eradication campaign until the disease is wiped out from Pakistan.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Polio eradication drive"}}

Based on the life of Bulleh Shah, the play was written by Shahid Nadeem and directed by Madeeha Gauhar. First performed in 2001, the play highlighted Bulleh Shah\u2019s journey to becoming a respected scholar and his longing for true inner realisation. Against the objections of his peers, Bulleh Shah became a disciple of Shah Inayat \u2013 a famous master of the Qadri Sufi lineage \u2013 who ultimately guided his student to his mystical awakening.Starting off with the death of Bulleh Shah, also known as Abdullah Shah Qadri, and the controversy around his burial, the life and times of the 16th century Syed, who became a discipline of Shah Inayat Qadri \u2013 an eminent saint who happened to be an Arian - unfolded. Punctuated with Bulleh Shah\u2019s poetry, the play was performed remarkably by the troupe. The addition of Bulleh Shah\u2019s poetry to the script, and the idea to tell the story with the help of two narrators were an effective way to avoid monotonous dialogue. Bulleh Shah was played by Usman Raaj, who also recited his poems beautifully. The Khawer Ali Qawwal group performed qawwalis on Bulleh Shah\u2019s poetry. The play focused on Bulleh Shah as a symbol of hope and humanism, and a powerful voice for tolerance and love. He promoted a relationship with God that was not oppressive, and allowed people to be religious and also respect other people\u2019s beliefs. He did not see any conflict between his spiritual beliefs and his devotion to music and dance. The playwright also presented two strategies to confront the tyranny of rulers. While historically inaccurate, the fictional meeting of two Punjabi icons, Bulleh Shah and Banda Singh Bahadur (a Sikh warrior who stood against the Mughals) highlighted two separate but contemporary perspectives. Their meeting in the play signifies their divergent world views. Where Banda Singh Bahadur believed in bloodshed and taking revenge with violence, Bulleh Shah upheld a spiritual ideology about peace and justice. Introducing \u2018Bullah\u2019 to the audience, Shahid Nadeem, the playwright, said the play was broadly based on events in Bulleh Shah\u2019s life \u2013 communicated through poetry, historical records and popular myths \u2013 and was ultimately a tribute to the great mystic. \u201cBulleh Shah lived in the time of the downfall of the Mughal Empire, characterised by conflict, rebellion, religious and civil strife and absolute ideological and political chaos. Those times were not very different from today,\u201d he said. After the play was over, Sabiha Umer, an audience member, told Dawn: \u201cBefore watching this play I didn\u2019t know about the life of Bulleh Shah.\u201d She had been shocked by the opening scene, where rulers refused to bury Bulleh Shah in his hometown. \u201cIt was an injustice to such a great personality, but time proved who was on the right path.\u201d\u201cSuch plays should be performed on a regular basis and also in educational institutions to raise awareness among youngsters about our rich culture and history,\u201d she added.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Asma Kundi", "title": "Bullah marks iconic Sufi poet\u2019s urs"}}
