The national flag-carrier thus incurred estimated losses worth Rs37bn in 2016 alone.According to the details provided by the minister, the airline incurred the following losses in past four years:\n2013: 44.32 billion\n2014: 32.22 billion\n2015: 32.53 billion\n2016: 36.95 billion (estimated)\n\nThe revelation comes as the national carrier is mulling suspending its flight operation for the United States from January next year, primarily because of \u2018low traffic\u2019.The airline has stopped booking for its twice-a-week flights for New York from November onward.
