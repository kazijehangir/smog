For the city\u2019s planners, this was meant to be a stop-gap arrangement; the landfill was originally located in the Kuri area, but ended up being moved here.If the wind is against you, you can smell the site before it comes into view. Located just off the I.J. Principal Road that divides Rawalpindi and Islamabad, the dump covers an area the size of one sub-sector, roughly where the I-12/1 neighbourhood should have been located.Bedford lorries and newer-model dumper trucks wind their way down the dusty path leading to the heart of the landfill. Standing on a small mound of dirt and trash, waving off buzzing flies, midges and other sundry bugs, a municipal worker makes an entry in his notebook for every load of rubbish that ends up here.Further afield, sanitary and municipal workers offload the waste. Be it human, animal or plant; metal, plastic, glass or porcelain \u2014 everything comes here. It is then sorted by local scavengers; the kabariye, who make a living separating recyclable items from the rest.As I scan this vast field of refuse, all I see is a tragic-yet-routine tale of civic negligence, of waste being buried blindly, no matter what the environmental consequence. But this festering Petri dish of a garbage disposal site has proven to be just as significant for a handful of scientists and academics from the Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) as the neglected Penicillin cultures in his laboratory were for the British scientist Dr Alexander Fleming.\u201cProf Safia Ahmed, Prof Fariha Hasan, Dr M. Ishtiaq Ali and I started working on the biodegradation of plastics at our microbiology research laboratory in 2002,\u201d says Dr Aamer Ali Shah, one of the co-authors of a research paper that recently caused a stir in the scientific community by revealing the discovery of a fungus that is able to utilise plastic polymers as the source of its food.The paper, which bears the otherwise dull title \u2018Biodegradation of polyester polyurethane by Aspergillus tubingensis\u2019, actually outlines a groundbreaking discovery; confirming the existence of naturally-occurring fungi that have the ability to perform \u201cbio-degradation and bio-remediation of pollutants in soil or wastewater\u201d.\u201cThis organism was isolated from soil and/or plastic samples collected from the I-12 garbage dumping site,\u201d says Dr Shah, explaining that researchers took topsoil and water samples from the landfill.For anyone even remotely familiar with humanity\u2019s growing plastic problem, this is nothing short of a \u201cEureka!\u201d moment. A recent study by the University of California estimates that our civilisation has produced over nine billion tonnes of plastic, most of which is conventionally thought to be non-biodegradable.But this discovery could change all of that. \u201cIf we get the right resources and funds, we would be able to establish an actual plastic degrading facility within three to five years,\u201d Dr Shah maintains.According to the scientists, the Aspergillus microbes were isolated in a laboratory and provided the right environmental conditions (such as temperature, pH, time, nutrients, etc) so that it would degrade polymers.What has been observed is that the micro-organisms break down plastics in two ways. They can either attach themselves to the surface of the plastic to form a bio-film, releasing enzymes that dissolve the polymer, or penetrate it mechanically in order to \u2018digest\u2019 it.It is a slow but naturally-occurring process, one that is not visible to the naked eye. \u201cMost synthetic plastics are produced from non-renewable petrochemical-based raw materials, making them resistant to degradation in the environment.\u201dDuring the course of their work, the team at QAU has also been keeping tabs on the toxicity of the by-products formed during this process.\u201cPollutants that only degrade partially can sometimes become more toxic than the parent compound,\u201d he says, explaining how polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can partially degrade to vinyl chloride, which is quite toxic.In an ideal situation, the microorganisms will be able to break down these complex compounds into water and carbon dioxide, achieving their complete bio-degradation.Given the import of what they have discovered, the scientists are hopeful: \u201cWe have done these experiments in our laboratories using whatever resources were available to us. We have now reached a stage where we can apply these micro-organisms in the field, but for that we need more resources.\u201dAnd those resources cannot come too soon. According to the foreman of the I-12 landfill, the site cannot take more than a few more months\u2019 worth of trash. \u201cThere used to be great big depressions in the ground here, which have now been completely filled up with garbage,\u201d he says, pointing to the horizon as a truckload of dirt is deposited on top of a pile of refuse and flattened by earth-moving machines.Once space runs out, the site will have to be relocated yet again. Unless a permanent solution is found, our civic managers may remain content to bury their problems in this and other landfills like it.

Over 16 years since the colonial Lunacy Act, 1912 \u2014 which quasi-criminalised being mentally ill \u2014 was replaced with the Pakistan Mental Health Ordinance, 2001, KP joined Sindh and Punjab this year in enacting its own mental health act. But these legislative changes have yet to provide even marginal relief to the estimated 20pc to 34pc of Pakistanis living with some form of mental disorder, exacerbated by the high prevalence of stressors such as poverty and violence. The most at-risk are inmates with serious psychiatric diseases, to whom the state still routinely awards death sentences, even though the diagnoses call into question the convictions. Then there are those who attempt suicide, which is still a criminal offence under the Pakistan Penal Code, and only inhibits the ability of families and healthcare professionals to provide necessary treatment. Even when mental illness is not treated as a crime, cultural stigma is enough to leave many suffering alone and in silence; even if this is overcome, Pakistan has less than 400 practising psychiatrists. It will take a lot of time and effort to build our national healthcare capacity to fulfil our mental health needs, but treatment is just one aspect. Promoting mental well-being is as essential, and ought to be embedded as a key target in every sector of national development, including education and employment. Implementing policies that create supportive environments in schools and workplaces can help normalise mental illness in public discourse and, more importantly, serve as a primary point of intervention for many who might otherwise fall through the cracks. Research conducted by Aga Khan University estimated the cost of Pakistan\u2019s mental health burden at Rs250bn per annum.

To strengthen the roots of the film industry and its revival it\u2019s important to enlist the support of like-minded people such as Dr Ishrat Husain, Ameena Saiyid, Jamil Baig, Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy. KFS was formed to support positive trends in film-making. The first KFS meeting was held at Governor House followed by this fundraising dinner.\u201cImportant film festivals around the world promote cities. PiFF aims to give a platform to talented film-makers and documentary-makers bearing cultural colours. With it, we hope to bring back life to this city of ours. We ask for support from all quarters and the diplomatic community.\u201d PiFF Festival director Abrarul Hassan and founder of the 60 Second International Film Festival walked the guests through a visual presentation of the PiFF\u2019s categories and events such as primary goal, membership and perks, film screenings, workshops, residencies, industry linkages, mentoring, gala opening and closing, panel discussions, exhibition of posters, film archive, photography and music, mobile screening, VR screening booths and AR display, activity timeline, daily story competition, women and film, besides features, documentary features, shorts etc. He said it created an opportunity for South Asian film-makers to work with their Pakistani counterparts and nurture the new generation of film-makers besides exploring the art of storytelling. \u201cWhy Karachi? Karachi was, is and always will be the custodian of film-making in Pakistan,\u201d the festival director said. Governor Zubair, who is also the patron-in-chief of PiFF, in his address said, \u201cI like films just as much as anybody else. But film-making was not considered a good thing during the \u2018Islamisation\u2019 era in Pakistan. The Quaid-i-Azam\u2019s narrative for Pakistan calls for a much more balanced approach, to maintain a fine balance and freedom for all cultural and social interests and the freedom to express oneself.\u201cCreativity is best expressed through sports, TV, films etc. Karachi was once at the heart of film-making with Waheed Murad, Mohammad Ali, Nadeem, Shakeel, all great stars from Karachi. Then the industry shifted to Lahore but it has now returned to Karachi. World-class films are being produced now. Me and my wife love going to cinemas to watch films, especially Pakistani films.

We need to change the narrative for this new Pakistan. Just one example was when Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy was invited to the PM House along with members of the diplomatic corps and A Girl in the River: The Price of Forgiveness was screened in an attempt to reign in honour killings. Eventually the legislation was passed. Sharmeen Obaid-Chinoy\u2019s topic remains outstanding.\u201d He said PiFF has given momentum to Karachi. \u201cWe are fighting for Karachi on various fronts such as working with Jahangir Khan, holding hockey tournaments and I\u2019m trying to bring the PSL final match to Karachi.

Earlier on Monday, the Sri Lankans were dismissed cheaply in their second innings for 96 but still managed to set Pakistan a target of 317 to win. Wahab Riaz and Yasir were the main destroyers but that really was not enough to bring Pakistan to safer shores. As I wrote these lines, Pakistan were ominously poised, having lost five of their top order batsmen with just 50 on the board in a snail-paced batting display. For this I will not hesitate to blame the two Pakistan openers Shan Masood and Sami Aslam who looked so ordinary and out of place as the Sri Lankan bowlers Suranga Lakmal, Lahiru Gamage and Nuwan Pradeep repeatedly beat their bats and had them groping at the ball.Shan\u2019s statue like existence was not only painful to watch but also left the handful of fans annoyed as he needlessly went into a shell to put pressure of his partners who came in after the fall of Sami\u2019s wicket.  His 21 runs off 101 deliveries and an unimpressive 15 in 69 balls in the first innings do not speak much of his skills as an opening batsman of an international team.As for Babar Azam, he may be a talented ODI player but he has clearly looked out of sort at the Test level, having lost his wicket cheaply on many occasions during the six Tests he has played.Serious cricket needs serious players who should be technically sound too and could tackle spin and pace as well as combat the nature of the wickets and conditions that change from session to session in five-day cricket.

The list, which also includes preventing immigrants from sponsoring their extended families to move to the US, drew immediate fire from Democratic leaders in Congress, who said it goes \u201cfar beyond what is reasonable.\u201d The administration tied its priorities to Democrats' desire to provide legal protection to some 690,000 immigrants known as \u201cDreamers\u201d who came to the country illegally as children and were covered by an amnesty by former president Barack Obama that Trump scrapped last month. \u201cThese findings outline reforms that must be included as part of any legislation addressing the status of Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients,\u201d Trump wrote in a letter to Congress accompanying the list, using the official name for the amnesty order. The White House list is topped by \u201cborder security,\u201d a category that includes building a massive wall on the southern US border that Trump promised would be paid for by Mexico, which has said it will not do so.Trump also wants to dramatically ramp up the number of officials involved in enforcement, hiring an additional 10,000 Immigration and Customs Enforcement officers and 1,000 attorneys, 370 immigration judges and 300 federal prosecutors. And he hopes to prevent immigrants from sponsoring extended family members to move to the US, limiting such green cards to spouses and children, as well as to close \u201cloopholes\u201d that prevent the deportation of children who enter the country illegally. The list includes financially targeting \u201csanctuary cities\u201d that have resisted the Trump administration's efforts to crack down on illegal immigrants. Criticism from Democrats\n\u201cThe administration proposes blocking sanctuary cities from receiving certain grants or cooperative agreements administered or awarded by the Departments of Justice and Homeland Security,\u201d it said.Other proposals include cracking down on people who overstay visas, restricting asylum and expanding criteria that would make someone inadmissible to the US. Trump's list was criticised by Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, the respective Democratic leaders in the Senate and House. \u201cThis proposal fails to represent any attempt at compromise,\u201d the legislators said in a joint statement. \u201cThe list includes the wall, which was explicitly ruled out of the negotiations. If the president was serious about protecting the Dreamers, his staff has not made a good faith effort to do so.\u201d The president has previously insisted the wall will go ahead and that he wants \u201cmassive border security\u201d in exchange for a deal on DACA protections. Trump has made toughening immigration regulations a central part of his first year in office, also issuing several versions of a controversial travel ban that has been criticised for targeting Muslim-majority countries and subject to numerous legal challenges. The latest version, which was unveiled last month, bans citizens of Chad, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Syria and Yemen from entering the US. Also suspended are certain Venezuelan government officials and their families, due to what the US called poor security and a lack of cooperation with American authorities.\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Trump sends Congress immigration legislation priorities"}}

The warning came after the White House said on Friday that President Donald Trump would announce new US responses to Iran\u2019s missile tests, \u201csupport for terrorism\u201d and cyber operations as part of his new Iran strategy. \u201cAs we\u2019ve announced in the past, if America\u2019s new law for sanctions is passed, this country will have to move their regional bases outside the 2,000km range of Iran\u2019s missiles,\u201d Guards\u2019 commander Mohammad Ali Jafari said, according to state media. \nOfficial says chances of talks will also end\nJafari also said that additional sanctions would end the chances for future dialogue with the United States, according to state media, and issued a stark warning to American troops. \u201cIf the news is correct about the stupidity of the American government in considering the Revolutionary Guards a terrorist group, then the Revolutionary Guards will consider the American army to be like Islamic State all around the world particularly in the Middle East,\u201d Jafari said. The Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) are Iran\u2019s most powerful internal and external security force. The Quds Force, the IRGC\u2019s foreign espionage and paramilitary wing, and individuals and entities associated with the IRGC are on the US list of foreign terrorist organisations, but the organisation as a whole is not. Iran sees the Sunni militants of the Islamic State (IS) group as an existential threat to the Islamic Republic where the majority of the population are Shias. On June 7, IS claimed an attack on Tehran\u2019s parliament and the mausoleum of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic, killing 18 people. The Guards fired missiles at bases in Syria on June 18 in response. Guards\u2019 commanders have framed their military involvement in Iraq and Syria, where they are fighting to support the government of President Bashar al-Assad, as a fight against IS. Dozens of members of the Guards, including senior commanders, have been killed in Syria and Iraq.Missile programmeThe website for state TV reported Jafari as adding that the United States was mistaken if it thought it could pressure Iran into negotiating on regional issues. He also said that Tehran would ramp up its defence capabilities, including its missile programme, if the US undermined a nuclear deal between Iran and Western powers. Under the 2015 deal, Iran agreed to limit its disputed nuclear programme in return for the easing of economic sanctions. However, Trump is expected to announce soon that he will decertify the deal, a senior administration official has said, in a step that potentially could cause the accord to unravel. \u201cThe Americans should know that the Trump government\u2019s stupid behaviour with the nuclear deal will be used by the Islamic Republic as an opportunity to move ahead with its missile, regional and conventional defence programme,\u201d Jafari said, according to state media. The prospect of Washington backtracking on the deal has worried some of the US allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis in the shape of North Korea. If Trump does not certify that Iran is in compliance, the US Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to re-impose sanctions waived under the deal. The UN inspectors have verified Iranian compliance with the terms. The Guards\u2019 navy was also carrying out a military exercise on Sunday in the Gulf, an area of tension with the US navy in recent months. More than 110 vessels were involved in the exercise, including some that have rocket and missile capabilities, a state media report quoted a Guards commander as saying.Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Reuters", "title": "US bases to come under threat if it imposes sanctions, says Iran"}}

The company\u2019s backers include Steve Cohen\u2019s Point72 Ventures and Silicon Valley\u2019s Bessemer Venture Partners.Under President Mauricio Macri the economy is beginning to recover from years of isolation from global markets, capital controls, protectionist policies and soaring inflation. Ual\u00e1 \u2014 a play on wallet and voil\u00e1 \u2014 sees an opportunity in the nation\u2019s meagre banking penetration: less than half of the population has a bank account, according to the World Bank. More than 50 per cent of Argentines are paid in cash, and almost a third of those whose wages are deposited withdraw their money right away.\u201cWe want to solve the lack of banking penetration in Argentina and reach people who don\u2019t have a bank account,\u201d Ual\u00e1 founder Pierpaolo Barbieri, 30, said in an interview. \u201cBy leveraging technology, we want to go from the 20th century to the 21st, where banks no longer have to be physical places.\u201dIn Argentina, 40pc of the population already has smartphones \u2014 and that\u2019s set to grow to 70pc by 2020, according to the trade group GSM Association. Users sign up for a Ual\u00e1 account through the app and receive a prepaid Mastercard. There are no opening, closing, maintenance or renewal fees.The card can be loaded with cash at Pago F\u00e1cil, a money transfer and bill paying service owned by Western Union and with several thousand locations in Argentina, or through direct deposit from a bank account. Customers can withdraw funds from ATMs for free twice a month and thereafter pay only charges levied by the machine\u2019s network. Through the app, they can transfer money between accounts, pay bills, get live notices on their card use and spending analysis \u2014 all without fees.Ual\u00e1\u2019s low costs should appeal to people who are deterred from setting up accounts by the high charges imposed by traditional banks on everything from monthly maintenance and ordering a chequebook to withdrawing money too frequently, said Barbieri, who was born in Buenos Aires and also serves as executive director of macroeconomic advisory firm Greenmantle from New York. For now, the company\u2019s revenue comes from fees paid by retailers.\u201cWhatever bank you\u2019re using is charging you to pay for all the branches they have, and you don\u2019t necessarily need that,\u201d said Ual\u00e1 angel investor and serial entrepreneur Kevin Ryan, founder of Business Insider. \u201cYou need ATM services, to transfer money between friends, to pay bills. This is a lower-cost form of banking and it\u2019s going to happen all over the world.\u201dIn addition to Soros Fund Management, Ual\u00e1 counts David Fialkow, co-founder of venture capital firm General Catalyst Partners, among its investors. Jefferies Group is also backing the company, according to people with knowledge of the matter. A spokesman for the lender declined to comment. The investors declined to comment on the size of their contribution.Ual\u00e1 expects 10,000 users by year-end. No one with the mobile app and mailing address will be denied the initial prepaid card, said Barbieri.The company also plans to offer personal loans, averaging 25,000 pesos ($1,420) for 18 months at competitive rates, and credit cards. Loans can go to borrowers with limited credit histories. Gradually, the company will use customer data gathered through the app and social networks to bring down rates. Argentines pay on average almost 40pc nominal interest on personal loans, according to central bank data.\u201cWe welcome fintech companies that use their own capital to lend to people that otherwise don\u2019t have access to credit, and promote new ways to save,\u201d said Lucas Llach, vice president of Argentina\u2019s central bank. \u201cThe informal economy is a reality in Argentina, and we want it to be fully formalised. In the meantime, we see these initiatives as a step forward.\u201dUal\u00e1 will have to overcome the resistance to bank-saving from Argentines who\u2019ve suffered through years of double-digit inflation. Bank accounts were frozen during the nation\u2019s 2001 debt crisis \u2014 just before the government abandoned a currency peg in a move that slashed those savings to a fourth of their value.Consumers in other developing nations like India and China with low card penetration and high mobile adoption have been gravitating toward digital wallets that simplify purchases, according to a report by Business Insider Intelligence.\u201cWe\u2019ve looked at financial innovation throughout the world and it tends to be most powerful when competing against banks with extremely fat margins and a terrible consumer experience,\u201d Brian Feinstein, a partner at BVP, said in an email. \u201cThis is exactly the environment in Argentina today, which puts Ual\u00e1 in a good position to make waves and take market share.\u201d\u2014 Bloomberg/The Washington Post ServicePublished in Dawn, The Business and Finance Weekly, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Carolina Millan | Katia Porzecanski", "title": "Soros, Cohen back app to lure cash from Argentine mattresses"}}

{"1362531": {"date": "Updated October 09, 2017", "article": "In the context of the current, arguably cynical and calculated backlash, the comments are perhaps appropriate. In the context of long-term challenges that state and society will inevitably have to confront, they are inadequate. Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal has rightly denounced elements that have threatened to declare jihad inside the country in recent days and emphatically asserted that only the state has the right to issue a call to arms. The interior minister\u2019s comments echoed what has been asserted by Gen Qamar Bajwa recently, the army chief having publicly stated that the state must have a monopoly over violence and is the sole authority to declare jihad. That the state is finally willing to push back publicly and firmly against extremist elements that not only reject the Constitution but also want to unleash violence inside Pakistan is a welcome change. A better future for all Pakistanis will not be won without confronting regressive groups operating inside the country.Yet, there are two problems with the formulation that the interior minister has chosen. First, it does not acknowledge the role that the state itself has played in encouraging jihad among sections of the population and in regional conflicts. If there are groups and societal elements inside Pakistan willing to threaten jihad over all manner of perceived offences, virtually all of them have found encouragement at one point or another from the state itself to do so. The state has only gone so far as to recognise that sustained and sweeping counter-extremism efforts are needed across the country; little has been achieved or even attempted in practice. The controversy that parliament has found itself mired in is an unfortunate illustration of the utter failure of the state to cleanse the public discourse of hateful rhetoric and its total failure to develop a national dialogue that is inclusive, rational and democratic. Are the elements urging violence today not a reflection of a state that unthinkingly and for long embraced ideas that are inimical to a modern, constitutional, democratic state?Second, there is a fresh danger in the very idea that only the state can declare a certain kind of religiously mandated violence. For the state to protect itself and its people against external enemies, or to defend itself in the case of a declaration of war against Pakistan, there are thoroughly legitimate, legal and internationally accepted reasons for doing so that do not appeal solely to religious sentiment. Where are these notions of a certain kind of religious edict being the exclusive domain of the state or necessary in any circumstances at all coming from? Instead of debating who has the authority to declare and wage jihad, the state ought to be working to ensure the total elimination of all non-state actors and militias. Pakistan must demonstrate that it is fundamentally committed to being a responsible member of a modern world order.Published in Dawn, October 9th, 2017\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Giving up jihad"}}

It was the biggest win in South Africa\u2019s Test history, surpassing the innings and 229-run victory over Sri Lanka in Cape Town in 2000-01. Rabada took five for 30 as Bangladesh were bowled out for 172, a slight improvement on their first innings of 147 in reply to South Africa\u2019s 573 for four declared. Rabada, 22, who had match figures of 10 for 63, became the youngest of 16 South Africans to take 100 Test wickets. He was playing in his 22nd Test. Only Vernon Philander (19) and Dale Steyn (20) of his compatriots have achieved the feat in fewer matches. It was Rabada\u2019s third 10-wicket haul in Tests. He took his tally of Test wickets in 2017 to 54, the most by any bowler this year. It was another poor performance by Bangladesh on a pitch which had bounce but was not especially bowler-friendly while ensuring South Africa didn\u2019t miss injured strike bowler Morne Morkel. A small group of Bangladesh supporters cheered during a bright fifth-wicket stand of 43 between Mahmudullah, who top-scored with 43, and Liton Das, who made 18. But their team gave them little else to applaud. Rabada and Duanne Olivier were aggressive from the start of play, when Bangladesh resumed on seven for no wicket. They sent down numerous short-pitched deliveries and three batsmen were struck on their batting helmets, including captain Mushfiqur Rahim, who had lengthy treatment on the field after ducking into a bouncer from Olivier with his score on 11 soon after the mid-morning drinks break. He was hit on his helmet near the temple area. Mushfiqur was dazed and lay down next to the pitch while the Bangladesh team physiotherapist and South African team doctor attended to him. He carried on batting for another 50 minutes until he was leg before wicket to Wayne Parnell for 26 in the last over before lunch. Mushfiqur was stretchered off the field after being hit behind the left ear by a bouncer from New Zealand\u2019s Tim Southee in Wellington in January but was released from hospital the same day. Mominul Haque was hit by a bouncer from Rabada two balls before hooking the same bowler to be caught at deep square leg for 11, while Mahmudullah was hit by Olivier before he had scored. On the final day on Sunday, Rabada was backed up by fellow pace bowler Andile Phehlukwayo, with Phehlukwayo returning 3-36 and completing the series victory by bowling last-man Mustafizur Rahman for 7. The Bangladesh batsmen only once posted a score above 200 in their four innings in the series. The bowlers did not manage to bowl South Africa out once, and managed to take a total of just 13 South African wickets in the two Tests.ScoreboardSOUTH AFRICA (1st Innings) 573-4 declared (A.K.

The progamme, organised by the Tehreek-i-Niswan at the National Museum auditorium, was attended by a jam-packed audience. It was third in the series since it was initiated in 2015. It featured impressive performances by artist/activist Sheema Kermani and her team, highlighting issues, such as societal hatred and bias towards religious minorities, violence against women and the case of missing persons, which set the theme for informative discussions. \u201cThe Women\u2019s Peace Tables initiative was launched in 2015 in the world and we did the same here. The aim is to show how communities, especially the most vulnerable ones\u2014women and religious minorities\u2014are suffering,\u201d Ms Kermani said. Women could play a pivotal role in bringing peace in society, she added. This was followed by a panel discussion on similar themes during which participants expressed concern for lack of women representation in the assembly and said they were deliberately kept out of the decision making process. The media and parliamentarians were also criticised for their failure in taking up issues plaguing society for a long time. The case of Zeenat Shehzadi, a journalist alleged to have been \u2018kidnapped\u2019 by security agencies and missing for two years, was also raised at the forum, with a plea that the media and parliamentarians should take up this issue. Naureen Lehri, a Baloch rights activist, spoke in detail about the many problems women faced in Balochistan, asking journalists to look deeper into issues. \u201cWhile it\u2019s important to highlight militancy, the media should also focus on the basic issues people face in Balochistan, for instance, an acute shortage of clean drinking water. Less than 12 per cent population in Balochistan has access to clean water whereas only 28pc women have access to safe delivery services,\u201d she told the audience, adding that more than 70pc people lived below poverty line in the province.

{"1362481": {"date": "October 08, 2017", "article": "\n\nTwo sides to Afghan-Pak relations\n\n\n''Pakistan was used by US'\n\n\nFormer Afghan president Hamid Karzai on Sunday questioned how \u2500 under the watch of US intelligence and military \u2500 the militant Islamic State (IS) group emerged in Afghanistan over the past few years.Karzai, during an interview on RT, also questioned why extremism and violence had increased in Afghanistan when the US had come to the country to bring peace and stability.\"The US came to Afghanistan to bring peace and stability and defeat extremism \u2014 [yet] we have more of it today. Why? That is what we should be discussing,\" Karzai said. \"Clearly bombings, killings, prisons and the harassment of people [in Afghanistan] have not worked.\" Noting that IS emerged in Afghanistan over the past few years, Karzai asked: \"Who did this under the watch of US intelligence and military in Afghanistan and how come?\"\"We have the right to ask these questions and the US government must answer.\" When asked if he had suspicions that US bases in Afghanistan \"were being used\", the former president said that he had \"more than suspicions\", claiming that Afghan people had approached him and told the him that they are being supplied with helicopters.\"[They have told me about] how unmarked, non-military coloured helicopters supply these people in not just one, but many parts of the country,\" Karzai said, adding that such reports were coming in on a daily basis from the people in Afghanistan and from Afghan government sources.The interviewer, pointing out that Britain had been supporting de facto IS and Al Qaeda-linked rebels in Syria, asked the president about the contrasting role Britain played in Afghanistan by liberating Helmand province. \"At that time, they did help. We are grateful for what Britain has done in Afghanistan; it was a much, much softer version of what the US did,\" Karzai said, admitting, however, that Helmand is no longer in control of the Afghan government today; rather, it is under the Taliban.\"How come there is more extremism in spite of millions of dollars and loss of lives?\" Karzai asked. When the interviewer followed up with a question about \"proof,\" Karzai added: \"The proof is what is happening in Afghanistan.\"He said that the questions that are being raised are founded on \"fundamental evidence of wrongdoing.\"The former president concluded that bombs and military action will not bring peace to Afghanistan. Instead, he said, Afghans must develop a \"mechanism of [their] own to reach to everyone, including the Taliban \u2500 the sons of our soil \u2500 to seek a settlement.\"He added that this process should be supported by everyone, adding that the US must act as a cooperative partner in the region with \"big countries, such as China, Russia, Pakistan, Iran and India to bring peace.\"When asked about a recent Taliban attack at an airport in Kabul that took place on the same day that US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis arrived in the Afghan capital for talks, Karzai said that the attack was an \"indication of how things are wrong.\"\"17 years on, the Americans can't even keep the airports safe on the day the defence secretary and the Nato chief are visiting Kabul,\" he said.Two sides to Afghan-Pak relations\nThe Afghan president said that there are two sides to Afghanistan's relationship with Pakistan; on one hand, \"when we became refugees of Soviet invasion in Afghanistan, Pakistan welcomed us tremendously, like brothers and sisters, and we lived like [we would] in our own homes.\"\"But then, as backers of the Afghan resistance against the Soviet Union, Pakistan and the Americans did the most horrible activity of trying to weaken the traditional Afghan system [...] weaken our moderation, our tolerant society and turn our religion into an extreme tool,\" Karzai said, adding that this involvement led to \"all other things\", including 9/11 and subsequent bloodshed in Afghanistan.''Pakistan was used by US'\nKarzai hoped that Pakistan would \"recognise that it was used by the US against a neighbour for a purpose that was not human\" at the time of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. He added that now the US, under President Donald Trump's South Asia policy, is doing the same to Pakistan to \"prevent integration and economic development in this region.\"Announcing his South Asia policy in August, Trump had called for greater troop deployment and Indian involvement in Afghanistan. The US president had also lambasted Pakistan for offering safe havens to \u201cagents of chaos\u201d.Karzai added that the common point between Pakistan and Afghanistan regarding Trump's policy was that both countries recognise it will not help matters in Afghanistan. \"We don't want to be tools in big games where we get stepped on for the objectives of others,\" Karzai said. \"Pakistan did the same to us, but we do not want to do this to Pakistan.\"He said that Afghanistan wants to \"extend a hand of friendship to Pakistan and join hands with the region to salvage ourselves from this conspiracy.\"\n", "author": "Dawn.com", "title": "'How did IS emerge in Afghanistan under US watch?' asks Hamid Karzai"}}
{"1362471": {"date": "October 08, 2017", "article": "\n\nPhoto by Arif Mahmood/White Star\n\n\nFaisal Jamil Kashmiri was chatting with a neighbour outside his home in Khawaja Mohalla, one of the oldest and thickly populated parts of the Azad Jammu and Kashmir (AJK) capital, Muzaffarabad, when a devastating earthquake rocked northern Pakistan on the morning of October 8, 2005. Tens of thousands lost their lives, hundreds of thousands were injured, and countless others were rendered homeless.Muzaffarabad was the worst-hit district in AJK due to its proximity to the epicentre of the quake. And within the municipal limits of Muzaffarabad, the entire old city \u2014 Khawaja Mohalla being part of it \u2014 was completely flattened.Kashmiri\u2019s three-storey house on a six-marla plot [about 150 sq yards] along a backstreet was home to three families, comprising 20 members. They included Kashmiri\u2019s family, his parents and two siblings who lived on the ground floor, his younger uncle\u2019s family of seven on the first floor, and his youngest uncle\u2019s family of eight on the second.The earthquake badly damaged the third storey, leaving his youngest uncle dead on the spot. Although the other members of the family remained unhurt, the structure became unliveable.\nIf the devastation of the October 8, 2005 earthquake wasn\u2019t enough, many citizens of Azad Kashmir are still reeling from unfulfilled promises of new housing\nAfter the burial of the deceased member, all three families moved to Rawalpindi \u2014 as almost all other survivors from the main old city had done \u2014 where they hired separate houses on rent.Some eight months or so after the temblor, Kashmiri\u2019s family returned to Muzaffarabad, to rebuild life bit by bit in the same dilapidated structure.\n\nOctober, 2005: In the aftermath of the quake, most residents of Muzaffarabad turned landless in an instant. Many migrated elsewhere, only to return to the same spectacle of despair | Photos by Arif Mahmood/WhiteStar\n\n\nHowever, they were undecided about its reconstruction. This was because the AJK authorities had announced that it will develop six satellite towns along the Jhelum Valley Road to overcome the housing problem in the ruined AJK capital. Kashmiri also imagined that he\u2019d be able to construct a new house in any of the proposed satellite towns because, back in the old city, authorities were not allowing the reconstruction of multi-storey \u2014 and in some cases, even a single storey \u2014 concrete structures. But what initially appeared a justified call by the government has ever since haunted the residents of the old city. Even 12 years down the line, Kashmiri still lives in the same dangerous building, waiting for the day when the government would make good on its promise to resettle those affected by the earthquake. And it\u2019s not just Kashmiri\u2019s story \u2014 tens of hundreds of affected families from the main old city could not and did not reconstruct their fallen houses or repair their damaged houses in anticipation of resettlement in the proposed satellite towns.Take for example the woes of 32-year old Khawaja Junaid, now a junior grade employee of the forest department.\n\nA view of the Langarpura Satellite Town from the left bank of the River Jhelum.\n\n\nAs the quake struck, Junaid\u2019s two-storey house along a main thoroughfare in Sethi Bagh neighbourhood tumbled down in a wink, leaving him badly wounded and one of his two younger siblings dead. His parents and another sibling miraculously escaped unhurt.Junaid remained under treatment in different hospitals over the next six months, following which, the family returned to Muzaffarabad and acquired a small house on rent.It was the uncertainty about the official plans to widen different streets and roads under a master plan prepared by Japan International Agency for Cooperation (Jica) that prevented Junaid for a long time from utilising his small piece of land for inhabitation.\nWhile the genuine beneficiaries do not see light at the end of the tunnel, the 20 percent plots for the previous landowners are said to be shifting hands ... without any formal allotment process, 233 plots have so far been sold out by previous owners in connivance with some unscrupulous officials in DAM.\nAt the end of his tether, he somehow managed to erect a tin-roof shelter on his small empty plot, and shifted therein. In the meanwhile, his parents died and he tied the knot and fathered a girl. He, too, desperately awaits allotment where he can move himself or his younger brother whose wedding plan has been put on hold because of their cramped accommodation.THE SLOW CRAWL\n\nHouses have sprung up on both sides of the Gojra Nullah. The watercourse was as vast as a playground about two decades ago, but today, it has been narrowed by constructions on both sides. Authorities say there are at least 1,000 families living in red zone, high hazardous areas and watercourses | Photos by Tariq Naqash\n\n\nGiven the skyrocketing prices of real estate in Muzaffarabad \u2014 almost at par with the federal capital \u2014 it became next to impossible for a vast majority to buy a piece of land within the municipal limits and then build a modest house on it. With landlessness a concern in almost every household in the old city, the government stepped in to provide relief. Or at least it pretended to having stepped in. Official figures detail that there were as many as 750 families in the old city who used to inhabit multi-storey houses that are technically unliveable now. The government decided on constructing satellite towns and shifting the affected out of the old city and into the new settlements. But things didn\u2019t pan out the way citizens expected them to. Three years passed after the quake before the federal government in 2008 released funds for the acquisition of land for these satellite towns. By that time, their number had been slashed to two.Consequently, 1,625.4 kanals in Langarpura Village and 669.17 kanals in Thotha Village were acquired against 608.697 rupees and 266.211 million rupees, respectively [a kanal is approximately 500 sq metres]. Both villages are located some 10 kilometres south of Muzaffarabad along the right bank of the River Jhelum, and fall in the AJK Legislative Assembly\u2019s constituency number 29.According to initial plans, the affected families were to be gradually relocated from the most vulnerable and hazardous areas within the municipal limits of Muzaffarabad to the proposed towns. In the main old city, open spaces were to be created where people could rush to safety in the event of a similar calamity.Things crawled ahead and three years after the money was released, a policy document was finally issued by the AJK government on July 30, 2011, to identify the categories of quake affectees who were eligible for allotment of plots in the two towns. They included affectees of  the (implementation of) master plan of Muzaffarabad city; projected population required to be accommodated in satellite towns; affectees of (possible) landslides in the municipal area of Muzaffarabad; affectees from the red zone/high hazardous areas; and 20 percent of the total acquired land (for satellite towns) for its previous owners. \n\nOctober, 2005: Medical supplies being dispensed from a tent pharmacy manned by police officers\n\n\nAccording to that document, such affectees whose houses or tracts of land have been acquired by government for any official purpose, after payment of compensation, will be allotted plots in the satellite towns against the officially determined cost and development charges. However, it also adds that if they do not receive compensation of their house or piece of land, they will be provided plots free of cost.The document also stipulates that affected persons living \u201cout of compulsion\u201d in the red zone or hazardous areas or along the main boundary thrust (MBT) where a minor jolt or torrential rains can wreak material and physical losses will also be entitled to free-of-cost plots in satellite towns, provided they surrender their vulnerable house or piece of land to the government without receiving any compensation. The landless or shelter-less survivors who have not received any compensation for their lost land will also be entitled to free-of-cost allotment of plots. It also categorically states that the previous landowners will be given 20 percent of land/plots against the determined cost of development charges. These towns were subsequently developed by a Chinese company under Muzaffarabad City Development Project (MCDP), which was directly supervised by the Earthquake Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Authority. According to official figures, the development work cost Rs1,625 million and Rs737 million in Langarpura and Thotha, respectively. The allotment process was to be carried out by Development Authority Muzaffarabad (DAM), the controlling authority of the master plan.ALLOTMENT AFTERSHOCKS\n\nOctober, 2005: Structures seemingly constructed on strong foundations came tumbling down\n\n\nThings seemed in place till it got to the allotment stage.The drawings obtained from DAM show that 1,652 plots had been created in Langarpura on about 43.5 percent of the total acquired land there. The remaining 56.5 percent was used either for roads or as open spaces. Similarly in Thotha, 1,135 plots were carved on 45 percent of the total land. However, in January last year, the PPP government decided that previous owners whose land had already been purchased to construct satellite towns would be given \u201c20 percent of the total acquired area, in the shape of plots, without any charge.\u201d A shoddily drafted official handout had stated at that time that AJK Prime Minister Chaudhry Abdul Majeed was of the view that \u201csince these people have sacrificed their fertile land for their quake-affected brethren, they should not be charged any amount for the plots, pledged to them at the time of acquisition.\u201d  This is in sharp contrast to the July 2011 allotment criteria. On March 17 last year, the PPP government constituted a nine-member committee for allotment of plots in the said towns, under the then DAM chairman \u2014 a novice in administrative affairs appointed on the recommendations of Zardari House. The committee included Chaudhry Mohammad Rasheed, then minister for works and communications, and Barrister Syed Iftikhar Gillani, then opposition PML-N lawmaker from Muzaffarabad city.Around the same time, the DAM asked \u201cdeserving persons\u201d through newspaper adverts to obtain allotment forms from a state-owned bank against a non-refundable amount of 3,000 rupees and refundable pay order/demand draft in the sum of 10 percent of the plot\u2019s cost as first instalment. The price was fixed at 100,000 rupees for one marla [approximately 25 sq metres].\u201cPreference will be given to the families affected by the master planning of Muzaffarabad city or by the landslides,\u201d read the adverts, adding, \u201cLandless survivors or those families with scant residential space will also get plots on priority basis.\u201dBy the first week of June, as many as 2,264 applications against Langarpura plots and 89 against Thotha plots landed in DAM, along with pay orders worth 250.795 million rupees. Separately, the DAM generated 8.5 million rupees from the sale of brochures.Not all applicants were genuinely affected or deserving persons, according to insiders.\u201cMost of the affected persons were unable even to deposit the first instalment of one to two lakh rupees along with their application,\u201d laments Ziauddin Pirzada, a survivor from Madina Market, who now lives in a rented accommodation ever since the catastrophe that left his mother, younger sister and sister-in-law dead. \u201cI can safely say that it\u2019s mostly the well-off people already in possession of sizeable property in different parts of the state who have applied for these plots.\u201dTHE CITIZENS\u2019 COLLECTIVEOn July 28, 2017, Kashmiri, whose satirical pieces on social and political issues in mainstream and social media draw huge attention, convened a first-ever meeting of the intended allottees at Upper Adda Muzaffarabad, in the wake of worrying pieces of information about the process. A second such sitting was organised by him at the same place on August 25, and attendees decided to launch a campaign on this issue.\u201cThose meetings were held in the wake of confirmed information that some people are attempting to delay the allotment process to facilitate the influential land mafia,\u201d Kashmiri says.The concerns of these citizens are not unfounded.While the genuine beneficiaries do not see light at the end of the tunnel, the 20 percent plots for the previous landowners are said to be shifting hands. According to DAM records, 331 out of the 1,652 plots in Langarpura were set aside under 20 percent quota of previous landowners. But without any formal allotment process, 233 of those 331 plots have so far been sold out by previous owners in connivance with some unscrupulous officials in DAM.\u201cI wonder how DAM kept on issuing the so-called istehqaq [entitlement] certificates to the previous landowners, intending to sell out the plots to anyone with deep pockets,\u201d asks Kashmiri.Similarly, in Thotha, 20 percent quota for previous owners has been worked out as 369 plots, notwithstanding the fact that 730 out of the total 1,135 plots had already been handed over to post-1990 migrants.So far, officials from the DAM have issued istehqaq certificates of 296 plots to previous owners. After the issuance of the remaining istehqaq certificates, only 36 plots will be left in Thotha for other survivors.Chaudhry Mohammad Raqeeb, a management group official who has recently been posted as chairman DAM, claims that a negligible number of Muzaffarabad residents affected by the implementation of the master plan, or falling in the categories of landless and shelter-less survivors or from the red zone, hazardous or landslide-prone areas have applied for plots.\u201cPerhaps because people were gradually allowed to make constructions in all such areas in keeping with the requisite precautionary measures, they did not apply for these plots,\u201d he maintains. \u201cIt\u2019s why allotments had to be thrown open to everyone living within the municipal limits, regardless of their being earthquake victims or not.\u201d  However, survivors disagree with his notion.\u201cMuzaffarabad is not a big city like Karachi where hardly anyone knows his neighbour, it\u2019s a small city of not more than a five-kilometre radius and thus almost everyone knows everyone,\u201d argues Junaid. \u201cWhy couldn\u2019t the concerned officials prepare a list of genuinely affected and deserving persons for provision of plots on priority. Given the present practice, all well-heeled people who have submitted multiple applications with different identity cards will clinch these plots, leaving people like us in the lurch at the end of the day.\u201dGhulam Muhammad, a survivor from Shahnara Mohalla, makes another point. \u201cThe conversion of just 44 percent of acquired land into plots means one marla costs at least 150,000 rupees to the government,\u201d he says. \u201cSince this money was meant for earthquake victims, the authorities are under an obligation not to dole it out to unaffected people, including the previous owners. Those who possess one kanal or more in their name anywhere in AJK should be declared disqualified outright for these plots, if the government really wants to help out the genuine victims.\u201d All said and done, however, there are more shocks in store for the quake-affected.While 331 plots out of 1,652 plots in Langarpura were set aside under 20 percent quota of previous landowners, Raqeeb argues that if the calculations were made on 20 percent of the total land acquired \u201cin the shape of plots,\u201d then previous landowners will be entitled to 916 plots, rather than the 331.  This is where the scandal exists: previous land owners are demanding more land than has been earmarked for them, and are justifying the demand on a mathematical lacuna. In effect, only 736 plots will be left for the rest of the survivors. Similarly, the share of previous owners in Thotha scales up to 623 plots. \u201cIf previous landowners are to be given 623 plots, the DAM will have to create another 72 plots (of bigger size) to meet that figure,\u201d adds Raqeeb.However, in a cautious manner, he argues that balloting for the 736 Langarpura plots should be held without further ado, before these may also become unavailable for any reason.Many wonder how such a big number of plots for previous landowners has been determined, particularly when there is no such precedence anywhere in AJK. Unlike the land acquired in Mirpur for the Mangla Dam Raising project and Mangla Dam Housing Authority, a different yardstick has been put in place in Muzaffarabad allegedly under the influence of the \u201cplot mafia\u201d working hand-in-glove with some unscrupulous elements in DAM. The plot mafia allegedly includes some political figures.The wheeling-and-dealing by the corrupt lot in civic bodies of Muzaffarabad, which sits on two major fault lines, has already exposed a sizeable portion of the town\u2019s population to disaster, and a fresh wave of unrest is on the cards, thanks to the faulty allotment policy on satellite towns.Even though the master planning of Muzaffarabad had recommended relocation of survivors from landslide-prone areas as well as from along the watercourses, the past decade has witnessed an upsurge in constructions on such sites in part due to the oversight and connivance of the officials concerned. Take for example the Gojra Nullah which used to have a vast span only around two decades ago. Such was its width that back in 1995, a playground was developed on it where local teams would play cricket matches. However, today, its span has shrunk to hardly 10 feet, as buildings have sprung up on both sides.Similarly, during reconstruction of their homes, the majority has not surrendered a single foot of land and resultantly the pathways are as cramped as they used to be before the quake. \u201cGod forbid, if we are again struck by any natural calamity, such as an earthquake or a cloud burst, the losses in such areas would be colossal,\u201d warns environmentalist Shafiq Abbasi. However, suppose the authorities decide on relocating the most vulnerable of these people at some point of time, where will they resettle them is a big question. Kashmiri believes that the authorities are literally cheating the survivors.\u201cIt seems the plots have already been distributed among the favourites in a secretive and illicit manner at the behest of corrupt politicians and bureaucracy.\u201d \u201cThe way we are being deprived of plots reminds me of 1846, when one fine morning the Kashmiris came to know that they had been sold out by the British to Dogra ruler Gulab Singh along with their land.\u201dThe writer is a member of staffPublished in Dawn, EOS, October 8th, 2017\n", "author": "Tariq Naqash", "title": "KASHMIR\u2019S 12-YEAR WAIT FOR RELIEF"}}

On Friday, the committee awarded this year\u2019s Peace Prize to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, or Ican, a conglomerate of global organisations working to stop the spread and use of nukes. While the award is well deserved and, indeed, timely, it may also be largely symbolic, as few of the nine declared and undeclared nuclear powers of the world would likely do away with their weapons anytime soon. However, in the current global scenario, even a symbolic gesture such as this is welcome. We have recently witnessed a nasty war of words between North Korea and the US (both nuclear states), while the American president has also threatened to tear up the landmark 2015 nuclear deal painstakingly negotiated between Iran and the P5+1. Moreover, we in South Asia live in an increasingly volatile region, with both this country and India possessing nuclear weapons, which add a dangerous element to the fraught relations between the two states. With so many nuclear hotspots around the globe, Ican\u2019s efforts should be appreciated and strengthened.As Nobel committee members have pointed out, the risk of nuclear weapons being used is currently \u201cgreater than it has been for a long time\u201d. To put it mildly, the leading actors in Washington and Pyongyang are not rational, with both having threatened to destroy the other. While tempers may have cooled for now, the risk of a flare-up remains. Where the Iran nuclear deal is concerned, it would be unwise of Washington to unilaterally withdraw from the agreement \u2014 some news outlets have observed that Donald Trump may be planning to scrap the deal in the days to come. Such deals to check nuclear activity must be honoured rather than broken, and nuclear powers must make efforts to reduce their own stockpiles. While stockpiles have come down since the Cold War days, the world still has about 9,000 nuclear weapons in the arsenals of various states. Nuclear powers must work collectively to reduce their arsenals, for as an Ican official said on Friday, \u201cfiery rhetoric could all too easily lead us, inexorably, to unspeakable horror\u201d.

Sangeena Bibi, 37, Jan Ahmed, 70, and Bas Bibi, 60, died at the Khyber Teaching Hospital, bringing the death toll to 48, said a press release by the Dengue Response Unit (DRU). It said that of 1,610 patients 336 tested positive in the province of which 102 were admitted. \u201cWe have planned to clear larvae from the houses in six high-risk union councils and as many surrounding UCs in Peshawar. From Monday, two male and two female health workers would start visiting houses to scale up knowledge of the residents about the causes of dengue haemorrhagic fever,\u201d Dr Iftikharuddin of health department told Dawn. \nDeath toll rises to 48 as three more patients die\nUnder the plan, the female health workers would interact with women inside houses while the male workers would inspect the water tanks on the rooftops and would identify larvae, he said. \u201cOur workers would demonstrate to the people the way how to eliminate the larvae,\u201d he said. The workers would revisit the same houses next week and would again examine the situation to ensure that the water pots were covered. He said that they would visit about 8,000 houses in each of the targeted UCs. The mosquitoes lay eggs which develop into larvae within six to seven days and in next 4-5 days mosquitoes are borne, he said. Dr Iftikhar said that the temperature would drop below 10 degrees Celsius in November, but before that they were taking steps to do away with the breeding sites. \u201cIn this way, we can eliminate mosquitoes within two weeks,\u201d he said. The plan to run from October through March also includes coordination between the health department and districts besides ensuring that both the public and private hospitals establish isolation wards and massive campaigns are launched about the prevention of dengue fever. The strategy is aimed at ensuring that all sources of breeding of mosquitoes are eliminated as there is likelihood that the disease could re-emerge after March if measures aren\u2019t taken, he said. The DRU would coordinate implementation of the plan under the supervision of Directorate General Health Services, he said, adding that the desired structure to meet all technical and managerial needs for dengue prevention and control plan in the province had been put in place. Dr Iftikhar said that the government would also set up an advisory group to provide technical assistance to DRU for monitoring and implementation of the plan. Peshawar is leading with 54,397 dengue cases, Mardan 3,026, Buner 994, Mansehra 644, Malakand 630, Swabi 339, and Haripur 184. The government is facing a daunting task to cope with the dengue epidemic as there are over 3,000 automobile workshops located in the high-risk UCs where old tyres are potential breeding sites of the mosquito. Since June this year, the province has recorded 60,807 suspected cases of whom 60,665 underwent diagnosis and 12,632 turned out to be positive. So far, 10,537 hospitalisations from dengue have been registered.Published in Dawn, October 8th, 2017\n", "author": "Ashfaq Yusufzai", "title": "Six-month plan devised to eliminate dengue larvae in Peshawar"}}

I try a faint riposte: \u201cChaliye, masla-e-riyasat kahein (Alright, let\u2019s call it the problems of the Riyasat)\u201d.At a seminar in Jammu city on September 26 attended by about 50 leading intellectuals of the Jammu region, Anuradha Bhasin, editor of the Jammu edition of The Kashmir Times and daughter of the veteran and much revered Jammu activist Ved Bhasin, patiently explains that \u201cJammu is the most plural of all the regions of the state\u201d.We are to learn just how true this is over the four days we spend in the Jammu region, to match the four days we were in the Kashmir Valley in May. Our journey takes us to Doda on the north bank of the Chenab, five hours by road to the northeast of Jammu city, and to Rajouri in the foothills of the Pir Panjal, four hours by road to the northwest of the city. The plurality lies in the extraordinary diversity of communities that inhabit this relatively small space.From Kathua on the Punjab border to Udhampur in central Jammu, the most numerous community is that of the Dogras. Hindus by religion, the Dogra community was dominant for over a century from Dogra Maharajah Gulab Singh\u2019s takeover of the Riyasat in 1845 and its subsequent expansion far into the Kashmir Valley, further westwards and north to Gilgit-Baltistan, and eastwards to Ladakh, till Maharajah Hari Singh signed the Instrument of Accession to India on October 26, 1947, in the wake of nascent Pakistan\u2019s invasion of the Valley. While Hari Singh spent the rest of his life in forced exile in Bombay, Sheikh Abdullah brought Kashmir to the fore. Ever since, the Dogras have felt themselves sidelined, although individual members of the community, above all Girdhari Lal Dogra, have held their own in the composite politics of the state.The substantial Muslim community in the Jammu zone nurses its grievances and feels excluded. Its most vocal (and rational) spokesman, Sheikh Abdur Rahman, former MLA of Jammu city and former Rajya Sabha member, says in his welcome address at the seminar that what has made Jammu and Kashmir a \u201cflashpoint\u201d is the combination of two factors: \u201cbogus elections\u201d and \u201cexcessive centralisation\u201d. The key imperative, he says, is the decentralisation of political, legislative and administrative power in a state as geographically and ethnically diverse as Jammu and Kashmir. He stresses the need for Regional Councils with defined legislative powers for the three regions of the state (Kashmir, Jammu and Ladakh); sub-regional councils for backward and \u201cignored\u201d areas; Hill Development Councils for the \u201cgravely neglected\u201d Pir Panjal and Chenab valley habitations; District Development Boards for all districts; and, above all, a vibrant system of Panchayati Raj (that does not exit in the Riyasat because the Jammu and Kashmir assembly has not accepted the 73rd and 74th amendments to the constitution).Despite the passage of 70 years since their forced displacement in the most barbarous conditions in 1947 and since, the very large number of Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan are not recognised as \u201cstate subjects\u201d and, therefore, banned from voting in state assembly elections or buying, possessing or selling any landed property. Subhash Sharma of Rajouri underlines that while there is much talk of \u201cPakistan-Occupied Kashmir\u201d, he and four lakh others are refugees from \u201cPakistan-Occupied Jammu\u201d \u2013 and they too must be included among the \u201cstakeholders\u201d. Sheikh Sajjad Munshi of Poonch, the entry point for most of the five lakh refugees according to his estimates, speaks in the same vein.Out in Doda, the Kashmiri- and Urdu-speaking Muslims ask why they are categorised as \u201cJammu Muslims\u201d and not treated as \u201cKashmiri Muslims\u201d to whom, they add, with no small justification, they are conjoined in ethnic terms. To our startled surprise, Abdul Qayyum Zarger, in his welcome address, recalls Jayaprakash Narayan\u2019s proposal that Jammu and Kashmir be accorded the same status as Sikkim and Bhutan. An eminent lawyer, Farooq Ahmed Khan, demands to know why everyone talks only of the 250 Kashmiri pandits killed in the Valley in 1990, but no one mentions the tens of thousands of Kashmiri Muslims \u2013 mostly innocent, peace-loving citizens \u2013 killed since then by the Indian security forces. Before 1947, he says, Jammu had a Muslim majority. Now, its demographic profile has been changed to render the Muslims a minority and thus promote a Hindu-Muslim confrontation between Jammu and Kashmir. To prove this, he cites Dileep Padgaonkar, head of the interlocutors\u2019 mission, who remarked, \u201cJammu wants azadi from Kashmir\u201d. I gently remind him that Partition was all about demographic change and that numerous parts of the subcontinent underwent dramatic demographic change. He lets the argument go, but not his resentment.On the other hand, the substantial number of Kashmiri pandits displaced from the Chenab valley into Jammu-Tawi want to know why they are denied the privileges accorded to pandit refugees from the Valley proper. \u201cThe Kashmiri Pandits talk only of themselves. Well, what about us?\u201dThe Pahari people of the backward reaches of the state feel put upon and excluded from affirmative action by the government. Why are they not given \u201cstate subject\u201d status and treatment, asks Khurshid Ahmed of Rajouri, who says he \u201chas no desire to go to Pakistan\u201d as solutions have to be \u201cfounded in secularism\u201d and communal amity. Within this framework, he stresses, Pahari issues must be settled. He is strongly supported in his demand for Hindu-Muslim harmony by Mohammad Shafi Dar. Even Amin Mohd Shamsi, avowedly of the Jama\u2019at-e-Islami, insists that Jammu and Kashmir is not a \u201cMuslim issue\u201d and claims that \u201cwe are a secular people\u201d; but adds, \u201cYet, none of us is happy, whatever our religion\u201d. This resonates with Najib Ataullah Suhrawardy\u2019s remark at our Jammu seminar, \u201cDard sab ka hai. Hum tho donon mulk ke liye khel ka khilona ban gaye hain (Our sorrow is common to all of us; we have become the playthings of both countries)\u201d.And those who live in the vicinity of the border and are unable to count the number of their dead and injured in seven decades of cross-border firing and the wars of 1948, 1965 and 1971, say, \u201cIt is only here that funerals and weddings take place side by side\u201d. Jammu\u2019s most senior advocate, Ashok Bharat Gupta, mourns at our seminar that Chhamb, the town of his birth, has changed hands at least four times since independence, leaving everyone confused as to whether the remaining inhabitants of the town, now in Pakistani hands, are Indians or Pakistanis. The scheduled castes think they belong to no one and nowhere.We did not meet a single satisfied resident of the Jammu region.Perhaps the most bitter are the Kashmiri pandit refugees. At our seminar, an infuriated, indignant, impassioned and highly articulate pandit leader, Kuldeep Pandita, thunders about the \u201c30-year tragedy\u201d of the Kashmiri pandits, at how, for the last seven decades, political parties of all hues have only wrecked their lives. Targeting me in particular for having spoken to \u201cseparatists\u201d, he demands to know, \u201cWhy do you meet separatists? Did you talk to them about us Kashmiri pandits? I am a human being. I am a Kashmiri pandit. I will not talk to those who talk religion, nor with shariat-wallahs or hardliners\u201d.He is not much reassured by my reply that I did separately ask the Mirwaiz, Shabbir Shah, Syed Ali Geelani and Hurriyat spokesman, A.M. Bandey, about pandits and their pitiable condition, and that all four of them had insisted, whether they really meant it or not, that the Kashmiri pandit community was integral to the identity of Kashmir and they would welcome them back to the Valley as part and parcel of any settlement of the Jammu and Kashmir issue.\n\nA Kashmiri pandit holds a lighted earthen lamp as he prays during an annual Hindu festival at a shrine in Khirbhawani, 30 km east of Srinagar, May 31, 2009 | Photo credit: Reuters\n\n\nAt a meeting of Kashmiri pandit intellectuals organised at the Jagti refugee resettlement area in Nagrota tehsil on the outskirts of Jammu city by Pandit Gopi Kishen Muju, a local poet and vocal civil society activist, there is unanimous anger at the Kashmiri pandits having been driven from their ancestral homes. With infinite bitterness, Roshan Lal Raina bemoans, \u201cWe were thrown out like flies from a cup of milk\u201d. With understated poignancy, Maharaj Krishna Bhatt adds, \u201cWe need our dharti to build ourselves; we do not have our dharti.\u201d His sad words echo another Kashmiri pandit, Pradhyuman Krishan Kher, who had said at our seminar that what the Kashmiri pandit was looking for was his lost \u201cizzat (honour)\u201d.Their opening speaker, Desh Rattan Pandita, upbraids me for having remembered them only \u201cafter a long time\u201d. He says, \u201cIt is the Congress that set fire to Kashmir\u201d and \u201cthe Hurriyat is the creation of the Congress\u201d, cautioning us to remember that \u201cKashmiri pandits are Hindus; we are Indians\u201d. He supplements his indictment of the Congress with the charge that all Indian parties \u201care against Hindus\u201d, adding, \u201cIt is not Pakistani Muslims who have finished us; it is Hindus in office who have destroyed us\u201d. Ravi Zutshi warns, \u201cSo long as Hindus are oppressed, Hindustan cannot last\u201d, while Ravish Raina stresses that \u201cif India exists, it is because of us Kashmiri pandits\u201d and that, therefore, they must be part of any dialogue undertaken to settle outstanding matters in the state. Instead, he remarks with profound regret, \u201cKashmiri pandits are not given anything while Kashmiri Muslims, even those who burn the Indian flag, are celebrated\u201d. Yet, says, Chaman Lal Raina, Kashmiri pandits are not communal for \u201cwe have looked after the Rohingya Muslims\u201d, the largest number of whom have sought shelter in Jammu.\u201cWe don\u2019t even have a primary school in our colony,\u201d says Maharaj Krishna Bhatt. I point to the huge billboards hailing Devendra Singh, the local MLA (and blood brother of Modi\u2019s minister of state Jitendra Singh) and ask why they had not brought this to their MLA\u2019s notice. Anger turns into a sarcastic giggle as they reply that Devendra is not their MLA because they are not allowed to vote for local candidates; their names are registered on the rolls of their respective but long-abandoned Kashmiri localities \u2013 \u201cand\u201d, he adds bitingly, \u201cour names changed to Abdul Saleem or Hamid Mir before the votes are cast in the ballot box!\u201dMeanwhile, the many Hindu and Sikh refugees from Pakistan we met at the Jammu seminar and in Rajouri demand to know why the government privileges the Kashmiri pandits over themselves?There are no easy answers, but it is clear that unless an intra-Jammu political dialogue enables the multi-hued Jammu region residents to come to a common position, the masla-e-Jammu could well outlast the masla-e-Kashmir.At the same time, there is a palpably osmotic relationship between the issues in Jammu and Kashmir. Many of the grievances of the Valley find an echo in Jammu, cutting across religious and regional lines. If Kashmir wants autonomy, Jammu too seeks autonomy, as does Ladakh. These two regions (not to mention the two other regions occupied, possibly forever, by Pakistan) are as important stakeholders in the process as the residents of the Valley. Their fates are intertwined and, therefore, \u201cholistic\u201d acquires a special resonance in sorting out the constitutional mess in the state.It is an altogether new beginning that is called for. The obvious point of fresh departure is to revert to October 26, 1947, as suggested by former Congress home minister P. Chidambaram. A leading Jammu lawyer, Imtiaz Mian, eloquently argues in the seminar that going back to 1947 would be the \u201cMother of all CBMs (confidence-building measures)\u201d.Everyone \u2013 literally everyone \u2013 speaks of the need for dialogue. While underlining that \u201cnothing is more important than dialogue\u201d, professor Ellora Puri, daughter of the late and much-venerated Balraj Puri, backed by retired Justice Saraf, stresses the key preliminary role of intra-state and intra-Jammu dialogue is to \u201cunderstand the aspirations of the different regions\u201d and \u201cbridge regional differences\u201d. She says, \u201cState autonomy should be linked to regional autonomy\u201d.There is also virtual unanimity among all we meet, including Kashmiri pandit leader Gopi Kishen Muju, that any Delhi-Srinagar/Delhi-Jammu dialogue must be accompanied by a sustained India-Pakistan dialogue. \u201cDe facto, Pakistan is party to the whole issue,\u201d says Muju; \u201cso, Pakistan (perhaps even China, since a part of the state is under Chinese occupation) must be taken on board.\u201d The inescapable need for an Indo-Pak dialogue to back up a parallel dialogue over Jammu and Kashmir is endorsed by veteran communist Comrade Shyama Prasad. Even the BJP\u2019s leading light, Chandra Mohan Sharma, who kindly sat through the entire seminar, said the BJP \u201cis open to dialogue\u201d while I.J. Khajuria, a Jammu Hindu from Kathua, went so far as to advocate a \u201ccondominium over J&K of India and Pakistan jointly\u201d to find through \u201ccooperation between the two countries\u201d a lasting solution to the region. To again quote Anuradha Bhasin, \u201cThe key lies in an India-Pakistan dialogue for we are joined to both countries\u201d. Also, says journalist Afaque Hussain, civil society, including above all youth and women, must be participants in the dialogue. Sardar Narendra Singh Khalsa, chairman, Sikh Intellectuals Circle, Jammu, hits the nail on the head insisting that dialogue must be \u201csincere\u201d for dialogue to succeed.For the scores of our Jammu interlocutors over four long days, so lacking in impact has been Ram Madhav\u2019s open offer of unconditional dialogue with all stakeholders that the only one to make any mention of this is Mir Shahid Saleem of the People\u2019s Movement, Rajouri, an affiliate of the Hurriyat, who reiterates Geelani\u2019s acceptance of Ram Madhav\u2019s offer, \u201calthough earlier we used to insist on the prior condition that J&K must be accepted as a \u2018dispute\u2019\u201d.Mohd Shafi Dar, echoing the Jama\u2019at- e-Islami\u2019s complaint that \u201ctalks have been held only to fool the people\u201d, joined several others in Jammu and Doda to demand that a \u201creport card\u201d be placed on the negotiating table of previous initiatives, including, above all, the autonomy resolution passed unanimously by the Jammu and Kashmir assembly in 2000 in response to P.V. Narasimha Rao\u2019s now-notorious pledge that as far as \u201cautonomy\u201d for Jammu and Kashmir is concerned, \u201cthe sky is the limit\u201d, as well as the interlocutors\u2019 report commissioned by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The reports of the six working groups set up by Singh in the wake of the Rangarajan committee report were also emphasised.There was some mention of Parvez Musharraf\u2019s four-point formula, but the suggestion was hastily withdrawn when I reminded my audiences that the first of the four points is that there is no question of \u201cazadi\u201d for Jammu and Kashmir. I press home my advantage by going on to remind them of my companion ex-MLA/MP Sheikh Abdur Rahman\u2019s remark that it took only five days for the tribal invaders from Pakistan to reach Srinagar airport in October 1947, and if they got \u2018azadi\u2019 now, Pakistan would covet the state and swallow them in five hours, let alone five days, were India to not once again come to their rescue.Overlaying all this talk of dialogue is deep concern over religious polarisation in the state, aggravated by communal polarisation in the rest of India. Professor Ellora Puri, cited earlier, decries the on-going communal \u201cpolarisation at the national level\u201d that is \u201cseriously aggravating polarisation within the state\u201d. In Doda, Abdul Qayyum Zarger\u2019s major apprehension is that Modi wants a \u201cMuslim-mukt Bharat\u201d. At Rajouri, Mohd Azim Shah and Sajjad Mirza both say, \u201cWe have suffered more in the last three years than in the previous 67 years\u201d because of the injustice being inflicted on Muslims in all of India.  \u201cWe are victims,\u201d says Azim Shah, \u201cof a power struggle in which we are not involved\u201d, while Mohd Maqbool Gujjar pleads, \u201cJust end our misery; stop this oppression\u201d.Where do we go from here? No-holds-barred dialogue on twin tracks between New Delhi and Srinagar and New Delhi and Islamabad is the only feasible way forward. What I have learned on this visit is that given the complexity of the situation in the Jammu region, the twin tracks involving New Delhi have to be supplemented by additional twin tracks of an intra-Jammu and Kashmir and intra-Jammu dialogue. Kargil and Ladakh, where Hussain of Kargil informs us at least 15,000 families are divided between Baltistan and Kargil, must also be involved as indispensable stakeholders. It goes without saying that absolutely every community and every geographical area must be included. And, above all, what is necessary in all these dialogues is \u201csincerity\u201d of purpose, as asked for by Sardar Narendra Singh Khalsa.I don\u2019t believe there is any \u201csincerity\u201d in Ram Madhav\u2019s offer. Perhaps Jammu and Kashmir will have to wait for another two years (or less) for an alternative dispensation to take Modi\u2019s place.\nThis article was originally published in The Wire, India.\nMani Shankar Aiyar is a member of the Congress party.

{"1362371": {"date": "Updated October 08, 2017", "article": "KARACHI: The country\u2019s wheat stocks have swelled to a record nine million plus tonnes. As per flour millers\u2019 data, substantial wheat stocks have accumulated due to carryover stocks of previous years. Wheat consumption in Pakistan stands at 23m tonnes per annum. Pakistan has been reaping bumper wheat crop \u2014 between 25-26m tonnes \u2014 for the last two years. However, this huge stock now appears to be a liability keeping in view consumption and unfeasible export potential. Currently, the Punjab food department holds 6m tonnes of the commodity, followed by 1.7m tonnes by Sindh, 1.4m tonnes by  Pakistan Supply and Storage Corporation (Passco) and 200,000-300,000 tonnes by Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan food departments. \u201cOur wheat stocks are at a historical high but it does not auger well for consumers and exports,\u201d Central Chairman Pakistan Flour Mills Association (PFMA), Chuadhry Ansar Jawed said. Pakistan cannot take benefit from the huge stocks due to high support price of Rs1,300 per maund (equivalent to over $300 per tonne) while global prices hovers between $150-170 per tonne, he said. \u201cConsumers are paying more for different flour varieties due to higher support price while millers also adjust flour price depending on the open market rate of wheat,\u201d he added. The market is abuzz with reports of another good crop by March/April next year. Good weather has so far proved beneficial for impressive wheat harvest in the last two years and per acre yield has also increased. Out of the 9m tonnes wheat stocks, the provincial governments are likely to issue 3-3.5m tonnes of the commodity to flour mills. \u201cDue to sizable stocks and availability of wheat in the open market, wheat issuance to millers by provincial food departments has been delayed by almost three months,\u201d Mr Ansar said. Millers are likely to start wheat procurement from the governments by December instead of September/October, he added. The time period of wheat procurement from Sindh food department by the millers would run for almost three months while Punjab would sell wheat to millers for four months. Around 50 per cent of the wheat stock is lying in open while the remaining has been stored in government godowns. Amid higher stocks, prospects of wheat exports still appear bleak in view of low price forecast in world markets. The flour millers have requested the government for granting $170 per tonne rebate to compete with low prices in world markets. He said old rebate claims of genuine exporters amounting to billions of rupees have not been paid by the government. \u201cEven at the rebate of $170 per tonne, we cannot expect to make sizable wheat exports as low world wheat price forecast will remain a major obstacle,\u201d the PFMA chief said. The government, he said, should devise a new export policy for at least two years for sea and land routes after consulting stakeholders for disposing surplus wheat which would otherwise rot. The subsidy should be revised after six months keeping in view world market prices, he added. Mr Ansar said Punjab government has asked wheat growers to grow different crops like canola in the cultivation area of wheat for which growers would get an incentive of Rs 5,000 per acre. Sindh government should also introduce a similar package, he added. \u201c80-90 per cent of subsidy and incentives schemes of Sindh government were marred by corruption,\u201d he alleged. The Sindh government has purchased some 400,000 tonnes of soft, poor quality wheat from low producing areas of Punjab at very less prices. Most of the quantity of low grade wheat has been dumped into godowns in Karachi. This year millers are again expected to buy sub-standard wheat, he claimed. The PFMA on record had protested the move of Sindh food department in the last two years but this year millers in Sindh would not lift soft wheat at any cost, Mr Ansar warned.Published in Dawn, October 8th, 2017\n", "author": "Aamir Shafaat Khan", "title": "Wheat stocks hit historical peak of 9m tonnes"}}

Russian-based striker Moussa Doumbia missed a first half sitter and struck the crossbar in the second half as the hosts, already out of contention for a place at next year\u2019s finals, came close to their first win of the campaign.

Should the Moroccans win, they will go top by a point and set up a potentially dramatic conclusion to the group next month when they travel to the Ivory Coast for their last match.
