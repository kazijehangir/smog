With its population having grown during the last two decades, the city is not receiving due attention from its managers. The capital city does not have a proper landfill site and garbage from the urban areas is being dumped in I-12, which is a residential sector. Most of the garbage from the rural areas goes into streams and the city\u2019s green belts are being used for parking and commercial activities.There is no audit of trees and the tree plantation campaign which the Capital Development Authority (CDA) \u2013 and now the Metropolitan Corporation Islamabad (MCI) \u2013 conduct each year in order to keep a check on plant mortality and the cutting of trees. \u201cIslamabad was designed for two million people and today, that is the number of people living in the city,\u201d said CDA\u2019s Director Master Planning, Zafar Iqbal Zafar during a briefing to a Senate committee on Thursday.According to the latest census, 9.7 million people live in the rural areas and 10.3 million in the urban areas. All of the rural areas are unplanned and there is no proper sewerage system or garbage collection system, which is affecting the environment of the city. Workshops in residential areas of the urban areas, such as those in the G-7 markaz which is known as Khada Market and encroachments in almost all markets of the city is also affecting the beauty of the city. The quality of air is being affected by the growth of industrial activities which has lead to an increase in smoke and dust.\u201cThe major polluters identified by CDA are steel furnaces operating in the industrial areas of sector I-9 and I-10. The authority has so far, identified nine polluting steel furnaces and formal complaints have already been lodged with the Pak-EPA being regulatory authority,\u201d reads a working paper which the CDA presented before the Senate Standing Committee on Cabinet on Thursday. It says that following Supreme Court orders, the CDA has directed all steel furnaces to install scrubber units to control air emissions.\n\nThe picture shows the remains of trees chopped down in a greenbelt in Islamabad. \u2014 White Star\n\n\nThe scrubbers have been installed in most industrial units and harmful emissions into the air have been curtailed to a large extent, the paper says.However, the managements of steel mills keep the scrubbers off most of the time in order to reduce electricity bills, the documents say, and that the CDA has also assisted Pak-EPA in sealing three steel mills in the recent past including Zia Steel in I-10/3, Silk Root Steel Mill in I-9 and Mustehkam Steel Mill in I-9.A few weeks ago, the auditor general\u2019s office through a special audit also tried to inform the government about the serious environmental challenges that the federal capital was facing. It says green belts are being used for parking and commercial purposes in violation of the master plan. It says the green belt in G-5 is used for parking while that in F-9 is used for the Traffic Police Office.According to the audit, various departments are using green areas and other spaces along the Mauve Area, G-8, G-9 and G-10 for parking purposes. The report pointed out that CNG and petrol stations are established along the Kashmir Highway and that kiosks have been established on green belts in all sectors.The report says bus stands and shops have been established on green belts between IJP Road and I-10 and I-9 and seeks the attention of the city managers in regards to the regular fires in the Margalla Hills, though the CDA and MCI are yet to take action to minimise the chances of fire.Spread over 12,605 hectares, the Margalla Hills National Park witnesses dozens of fire incidents every year. During the five years between 2009 and 2014, the hills have faced over 146 fires, which damage forests and adds to air pollution in the federal capital among other adverse effects.\u201cNo preventive measure appeared to have been adopted by the CDA/MCI [to] mitigate the risk of fire and to reduce the instances of fire,\u201d the audit pointed out. The katchi abadis based on the beds of nullahs including those in G-7, G-8 and F-7 also add to the sewage problems and debris from demolished houses is also thrown into the nullahs.\u201cI do agree that there several environmental problems in the federal capital which have piled up during the last two decades but we are taking steps to bring improvement,\u201d said MCI\u2019s chief metropolitan officer Asad Mehboob Kayani.\u201cWe have imposed a complete ban on all types of unauthorised buildings in Islamabad and we are also working on establishing a permanent landfill site. We will also introduce a garbage collection system for all of Islamabad as currently, garbage is only collected in the urban areas,\u201d he said.DG Environment Dr Sulman Sheikh also said that steps are being taken to stop environment harming activities in Islamabad.According to sources in the environment directorate, corruption and nepotism is affecting the performance of the entire department where several corruption inquiries have been pending for years. They said officers responsible for the beautification of Islamabad and for the protection of the environment and forests do not have the qualifications to do so.\u201cYou will not believe that this directorate has around 4,000 employees if you visit the city and its parks,\u201d an officer of the MCI said, adding that at times, junior officers are given double charges if they do not have the right candidate and in case of shortage of manpower.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "Kashif Abbasi", "title": "Islamabad fast losing its beauty due to poor environmental management"}}

An informed source told Dawn that the council initiated the proceedings on a reference against a sitting judge of the Lahore High Court, but decided to reserve its verdict when the judge objected to the presence of one of the SJC members who is also facing a similar reference relating to misconduct before the council. The LHC judge is accused of having offshore assets at the time when he was inducted into the judiciary, and it has to be decided whether or not the foreign companies have ever been declared as assets. During the long proceedings presided over by Chief Justice Mian Saqib Nisar, the high court judge, through his counsel, asked how the SJC could determine the fate of a judge when one of its members was facing allegations of misconduct in the same council. Established under Article 209 of the Constitution, the SJC probes allegations against judges of the Supreme Court and high courts regarding misconduct or inability to perform their duties for reasons of mental or physical incapacity. Under Article 209(8), the council also issues a code of conduct requiring the judges to demonstrate the highest moral and ethical values. Meanwhile, the SJC will also resume proceedings against another senior judge of the Islamabad High Court on Tuesday on a reference relating to refurbishment of official residence beyond entitlement. The judge, who had been issued a show-cause notice on Feb 15, requested the SJC to hold his trial in the open, arguing that Article 10A of the Constitution guaranteed fair trial and due process. But his request was turned down by the council on May 18. Consequently, the judge filed in the Supreme Court a constitutional petition arguing that he enjoyed the fundamental right to insist that the inquiry into his conduct be held publicly. He sought a directive for the SJC to suspend the proceedings till the pendency of his petition in the apex court. In his petition, the judge also questioned paragraph 13 of the Supreme Judicial Council Procedure of Inquiry 2005 that deals with the in-camera proceedings and argued that the section was in violation of Articles 4, 10A, 18 and 25 of the Constitution because it did not allow the trial in the council to take place in accordance with the law and was detrimental to the life and liberty of the one facing the trial. The petition argued that the SJC had erred by observing that it was on account of the sanctity of the institution and the dignity of the applicant and other judges whose matters were inquired into by the council that in-camera proceedings were expedient. The petitioner said he had nothing to hide and his dignity was not compromised if the proceedings were held in the open, adding that it was not in the interest of the judiciary if the proceedings were held in-camera because it would damage the image of the institutions.

{"1362829": {"date": "Updated October 10, 2017", "article": "ISLAMABAD: For over three years now, a vacant patch of land in Sector I-12 has served as the repository for all of the capital\u2019s garbage. For the city\u2019s planners, this was meant to be a stop-gap arrangement; the landfill was originally located in the Kuri area, but ended up being moved here.If the wind is against you, you can smell the site before it comes into view. Located just off the I.J. Principal Road that divides Rawalpindi and Islamabad, the dump covers an area the size of one sub-sector, roughly where the I-12/1 neighbourhood should have been located.Bedford lorries and newer-model dumper trucks wind their way down the dusty path leading to the heart of the landfill. Standing on a small mound of dirt and trash, waving off buzzing flies, midges and other sundry bugs, a municipal worker makes an entry in his notebook for every load of rubbish that ends up here.Further afield, sanitary and municipal workers offload the waste. Be it human, animal or plant; metal, plastic, glass or porcelain \u2014 everything comes here. It is then sorted by local scavengers; the kabariye, who make a living separating recyclable items from the rest.As I scan this vast field of refuse, all I see is a tragic-yet-routine tale of civic negligence, of waste being buried blindly, no matter what the environmental consequence. But this festering Petri dish of a garbage disposal site has proven to be just as significant for a handful of scientists and academics from the Quaid-i-Azam University (QAU) as the neglected Penicillin cultures in his laboratory were for the British scientist Dr Alexander Fleming.\u201cProf Safia Ahmed, Prof Fariha Hasan, Dr M. Ishtiaq Ali and I started working on the biodegradation of plastics at our microbiology research laboratory in 2002,\u201d says Dr Aamer Ali Shah, one of the co-authors of a research paper that recently caused a stir in the scientific community by revealing the discovery of a fungus that is able to utilise plastic polymers as the source of its food.The paper, which bears the otherwise dull title \u2018Biodegradation of polyester polyurethane by Aspergillus tubingensis\u2019, actually outlines a groundbreaking discovery; confirming the existence of naturally-occurring fungi that have the ability to perform \u201cbio-degradation and bio-remediation of pollutants in soil or wastewater\u201d.\u201cThis organism was isolated from soil and/or plastic samples collected from the I-12 garbage dumping site,\u201d says Dr Shah, explaining that researchers took topsoil and water samples from the landfill.For anyone even remotely familiar with humanity\u2019s growing plastic problem, this is nothing short of a \u201cEureka!\u201d moment. A recent study by the University of California estimates that our civilisation has produced over nine billion tonnes of plastic, most of which is conventionally thought to be non-biodegradable.But this discovery could change all of that. \u201cIf we get the right resources and funds, we would be able to establish an actual plastic degrading facility within three to five years,\u201d Dr Shah maintains.According to the scientists, the Aspergillus microbes were isolated in a laboratory and provided the right environmental conditions (such as temperature, pH, time, nutrients, etc) so that it would degrade polymers.What has been observed is that the micro-organisms break down plastics in two ways. They can either attach themselves to the surface of the plastic to form a bio-film, releasing enzymes that dissolve the polymer, or penetrate it mechanically in order to \u2018digest\u2019 it.It is a slow but naturally-occurring process, one that is not visible to the naked eye. \u201cMost synthetic plastics are produced from non-renewable petrochemical-based raw materials, making them resistant to degradation in the environment.\u201dDuring the course of their work, the team at QAU has also been keeping tabs on the toxicity of the by-products formed during this process.\u201cPollutants that only degrade partially can sometimes become more toxic than the parent compound,\u201d he says, explaining how polyvinyl chloride (PVC) can partially degrade to vinyl chloride, which is quite toxic.In an ideal situation, the microorganisms will be able to break down these complex compounds into water and carbon dioxide, achieving their complete bio-degradation.Given the import of what they have discovered, the scientists are hopeful: \u201cWe have done these experiments in our laboratories using whatever resources were available to us. We have now reached a stage where we can apply these micro-organisms in the field, but for that we need more resources.\u201dAnd those resources cannot come too soon. According to the foreman of the I-12 landfill, the site cannot take more than a few more months\u2019 worth of trash. \u201cThere used to be great big depressions in the ground here, which have now been completely filled up with garbage,\u201d he says, pointing to the horizon as a truckload of dirt is deposited on top of a pile of refuse and flattened by earth-moving machines.Once space runs out, the site will have to be relocated yet again. Unless a permanent solution is found, our civic managers may remain content to bury their problems in this and other landfills like it.

The games are being held in Gold Coast, Australia, from April 4 to 15. The medalists of Commonwealth Games, Abdul Ghafoor (weightlifting), Muhammad Inam (wrestler) and Talha Talib (weightlifting) were also present. Though Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif was invited to the event as chief guest, he could not attend it and Punjab Sports Minister Jahangir Khanzada was represented him.Australian High Commissioner Margaret Adamson also flew to Lahore from Islamabad to attend the grand ceremony. The baton had arrived in Lahore from Cyprus on Sept 29 but because of Muharram mourning days, no ceremony could be held immediately. After the Ashura, back-to-back ceremonies were held on last Monday. The first was held at Hazuri Bagh and the second in a renowned private school. The baton left Pakistan for India on Oct 3 for its next destination. Pakistan Olympic Association (POA) president retired Lt-Gen Arif Hasan, secretary Khalid Mahmood, Sports Board of Punjab Director-General Zulfiqar Ghumman and Sports Department secretary Nayyer Iqbal also attended the ceremony. The event brought together after many years both the POA and the Punjab government. Since 2012, the government has been at a distance from the POA activities over the issues, such as the implementation of the National Sports Policy. But in 2015, the dispute was resolved when the International Olympic Committee was about to suspend Pakistan\u2019s membership because of the interference of the government in the affairs of the POA.After completing the tour of 52 countries, the baton will land in Gold Coast, Australia, in April. The most missing personality on this occasion was the mayor of Lahore. The last week, SBP Director-General Zulifqar Ghumman and Secretary Nayyer Iqbal were transferred. Their successor is Aamir Jan, who is currently performing as the Gujranwala deputy commissioner. He holds the charge of both the secretary and the director general. It means Mr Jan will be a powerful boss. In the past, the Punjab government, instead of serving the cause of sports people, has been using the SBP as a political tool. First, the SBP was used for a youth festival, which did not serve the real cause of sports. In the last couple of years, no valuable sporting activities were conducted for the government would say it was focusing more on the expansion of the sports infrastructure in the province. Hardly any stadium was inaugurated in the last three years. Even the much delayed International Swimming Pool and Tennis Complex at the Gaddafi Stadium could not be inaugurated formally, even after the passage of nine years. The SBP, for the last three years, has also been promoting cricket, which is not in its domain. Since the Pakistan Cricket Board, the cash rich body of the country, is spending huge money on Under-16, U-19, inter-school and inter-club cricket programmes, the SBP should not spend much from its kitty on the promotion of cricket. Instead, it should serve the athletes of other neglected sports like athletics, badminton, boxing, tennis, swimming, karate, judo and many others.The Lahore Region Cricket Association\u2019s two teams - Blues and Whites - are contesting in the premier domestic event of the Quaid-i-Azam Trophy, which is being held across the country under the auspices of the Pakistan Cricket Board. At the end of the second round, the Lahore Blues stand at the third place in Pool-A with 10 points, followed by SSGC and Wapda.

But he was left speechless when a woman lawyer suggested that he remove some of the intelligence operatives from the court to make room for Ms Sharif.Ms Sharif appeared in court at around 9am, while her husband, who was taken into custody by NAB soon after their arrival at Islamabad airport, was brought to court an hour later.She was accompanied by her son-in-law Raheel Munir, Dr Asif Kirmani, Pervez Rashid, Daniyal Aziz, Anusha Rehman, Saira Afzal Tarar, Marvi Memon, Tahira Aurangzeb, Maiza Hameed and others. Mohammad Talal Chaudhry and Marriyum Aurangzeb, however, preferred to remain outside the courtroom.Ms Sharif was seated in the front row, flanked by Pervez Rashid and Asif Kirmani, and was mobbed by PML-N workers and lawyers during the interval, all of whom wanted to convey their grievances to her.When the hearing got under way, NAB\u2019s investigation officers \u2014 Deputy Directors Mohammad Kamran and Mehboob Alam, as well as Assistant Director Mohammad Imran \u2014 told the court that summons had been delivered to Hussain and Hassan Nawaz at their residences in Pakistan and abroad.At the outset, Khawaja Haris Ahmed, counsel for Mr Sharif and his daughter, submitted two applications \u2014 for seeking an exemption from personal attendance and another seeking a 15-day adjournment.He told the court that the former prime minister was in London to tend to his ailing wife, Kulsoom Nawaz, who was undergoing treatment for lymphoma, a cancer of the lymph nodes. He said that Begum Kulsoom was in a critical condition and had not recovered despite a third surgery.The application stated that she was about to start chemotherapy from Oct 11 and that \u201cin these circumstances, the applicant (Nawaz Sharif) was forced to rush to London\u201d.But the application was opposed by NAB Deputy Prosecutor General Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi, who argued that the application could only be considered if the accused was present in court.But the defence counsel pointed out that on Sept 26, the judge hearing arguments on a plea for permanent exemption said that a day\u2019s exemption may be granted to Mr Sharif in case of an emergency.Thereafter, the court exempted Mr Sharif from appearing on Monday, but fixed Oct 13 for his indictment. The judge also barred Capt Safdar from all foreign travel without the court\u2019s approval.When the lawmaker from Manshera entered, the judge was not present in the courtroom. Taking advantage of this, an over-enthusiastic lawyer tried to raise a slogan, but was immediately snubbed by PML-N lawyers, who advised him to observe decorum.During the hearing, the courtroom became so overcrowded that cabinet minister Daniyal Aziz began to feel claustrophobic.Amjad Pervez, counsel for Capt Safdar, requested the judge to release his client against surety bonds. But this was opposed by NAB prosecutor Afzal Qureshi, who argued that under Section 9-B of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO), an accused arrested under the schedule of offences could only apply for bail before a two-member division bench of the high court.But Mr Pervez contended that Capt Safdar was not arrested under the schedule of offences, rather was taken into custody on the order of the accountability judge.The counsel maintained that NAB chairman was the only authority who could issue arrest warrants in connection with schedule offences. But when the prosecution confirmed that its chairman had not issued arrest warrants for Capt Safdar, the judge ordered the defendant to submit surety bonds worth Rs5 million.Up to this point, Ms Sharif seemed visibly worried. When arguments concluded, a court reporter standing next to Tariq Fazal Chaudhry explained that Capt Safdar had been granted bail. The state minister then relayed the information to Ms Sharif, who became visibly relaxed upon hearing the news.The court also directed Ms Sharif to submit surety bonds worth Rs5m.Maryam\u2019s press talk\nAddressing the media outside the courtroom, Ms Sharif said that despite having serious reservations, her family had joined the process initiated for their accountability.She said that in addition to politicians, those who had turned the law and Constitution into a joke are equally liable to be held accountable.Reiterating that the cases against the Sharif family were politically motivated, she said her father had bowed before the courts, while she was put in the dock and her husband was arrested.But those who disrespected the courts and absconded were holding political processions and appearing before other courts.She said that when those charged with administering justice become a party in a case, what could be expected of them.Talking about the appearance of her brothers Hussain and Hassan Nawaz, she said that they were independent in their decisions and that as non-resident Pakistanis, were not subject to local laws for the time being.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "Malik Asad", "title": "Maryam, Safdar get bail on first court appearance"}}
{"1362779": {"date": "October 10, 2017", "article": "STOCKHOLM: The Nobel prize in economics was awarded on Monday to Richard Thaler of the University of Chicago for research showing how people\u2019s choices on economic matters whether on savings or game shows like \u201cDeal or No Deal\u201d are not always rational.Thaler won the 9-million-kronor ($1.1-million) prize for \u201cunderstanding the psychology of economics,\u201d Swedish Academy of Sciences secretary Goran Hansson said on Monday.Thaler is considered a founding father of behavioural economics, a field that shows that far from being the rational decision-makers described in economic theory, people often make choices that don\u2019t serve their best interests. That could include, for example, refusing to cut their losses when their investments plunge in value or making big bets at the casino because they are convinced their hot streak will continue.The illogical behaviour has economic consequences: People spend more than they should and don\u2019t save enough for retirement. They make investments in houses in the mid-2000s, for instance when prices are already dangerously high.The Nobel committee said Thaler has provided a \u201cmore realistic analysis of how people think and behave when making economic decisions.\u201d Asked by phone at a news conference what he planned to do with his prize money, Thaler joked that he intended to spend it \u201cas irrationally as possible.\u201d \u2018 In an interview later with this news agency, Thaler offered a deeper response that drew on the philosophy of his work: \u201cIn traditional economic theory, it\u2019s a silly question. And the reason is that money doesn\u2019t come with labels. So once that money is in my bank, how do I know whether that fancy bottle of wine I\u2019m buying (is being paid for by) Nobel money or some other kind of money? The serious answer to the question is that I plan to spend some of it on having fun and give the rest away to the neediest causes I can find.\u201d In 2015, Thaler provided a cameo alongside pop star Selena Gomez in the film \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d about the global financial crisis. In the scene, Thaler explains the \u201chot hand fallacy,\u201d in which people think whatever\u2019s happening now is going to continue to happen into the future.Asked at the news conference Monday if he thought this observation applied to the US president, who had some success as a business executive before entering politics, he said: \u201cAs to President Trump, I think he would do well to watch that movie.\u201d In 2008, Thaler co-wrote a paper examining the choices contestants face in games such as the TV show \u201cDeal or No Deal,\u201d including about how early outcomes affect decisions later in the game. In the paper, Thaler and the authors find that contestants become bolder in their choices when their initial expectations of how much they would win are shattered, whether by big losses or big gains.Peter Gardenfors, a member of the prize committee, said that one of the practical applications of Thaler\u2019s work was development of the \u201csave more tomorrow\u201d strategy for retirement-savings accounts. Under that model, many employees who resist immediately raising the portion of their salary put into retirement accounts will agree to raise their contributions in the following year and usually continue with the higher level.Thaler\u2019s contributions include studying the \u201climited rationality\u201d trait that includes behaviour such as the unwillingness to pay off high-interest credit card debt from a low-interest savings account. He also has studied lack of self-control as it relates to economics.\u201cOne thing that we all recognise is that we have a little angel on our left side of our shoulder and the devil on our right side of our shoulder, and the devil wants us to have pleasure instantly whilst the angel wants us to plan in a responsible and far-sighted way,\u201d prize committee member Peter Fredriksson said.Thaler is not the first behavioural economist to win the Nobel. In 2002, the award went to Israeli-American psychologist Daniel Kahneman who used psychological insights to study how people make economic decisions.The economics prize is something of an outlier Alfred Nobel\u2019s will didn\u2019t call for its establishment and it honours a science that many doubt is a science at all.The Sveriges Riksbank (Swedish National Bank) Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel was first awarded in 1969, nearly seven decades after the series of prestigious prizes that Nobel called for. Despite its provenance and carefully laborious name, it is broadly considered an equal to the other Nobel and the winner attends the famed presentation banquet.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "AP", "title": "Richard Thaler wins Nobel for work in behavioural economics"}}

The sport\u2019s governing body has argued for years that a Test championship is needed to boost the five-day format\u2019s popularity as crowds and television viewers flock to the big-hitting Twenty20 version of the game. But squabbling over formats and fears that some nations will be disadvantaged have twice stymied efforts to launch a league structure since 2010. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that plans for a nine-nation Test championship were now well advanced and the ICC was set to give the concept a green light on Friday at a meeting in Auckland. It said the first edition of the competition would run over a two-year cycle beginning in 2019, culminating in a final between the top two teams at Lord\u2019s. Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland said the league competition would give Test series a broader international \u2018context\u2019, making them more than stand-alone bilateral contests. \u201cYou\u2019re also creating structure in such a way that you no longer have games without meaning. They are all part of a league championship,\u201d he told the Sydney Morning Herald. Purists view Test cricket as the pinnacle of the sport but it has struggled, particularly in Asia, as lucrative T20 competitions such as the Indian Premier League have caught the public\u2019s imagination. A recent innovation designed to reverse the trend is the introduction of day-night Test matches, which moves playing sessions to more spectator-friendly hours. The idea of four-day Test matches has also been floated, although traditionalists oppose the move. The Herald reported that the ICC will also look at a major shake-up of One-day Inter\u00adnational fixtures at the Auckland meeting. It said a 13-nation ODI league was being considered, which would operate on a three-year cycle with results affecting World Cup qualification. Under the plans, the number of ODIs in a series would be capped at three, ending the lengthy five-match series that are currently part of the international fixture list.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "ICC set to approve Test championship"}}

Growth in South Asia is expected to be 6.9 per cent in 2018. It is anticipated to stabilise around 7pc over the medium term, according to the twice-a-year South Asia Economic Focus (SAEF) report.South Asia remained the fastest-growing region in the world since the second quarter of 2014. In the first quarter of 2016, regional growth reached a record high of 9.1pc. But the growth rate gradually and steadily declined afterwards.Despite concerns about its weakening macroeconomic discipline, growth in Pakistan is expected to increase to 5.3pc during the current fiscal year and 5.8pc in 2019, the report said.Robust growth prospects rest on the expectation that domestic consumption will remain strong, private-sector investment will regain momentum and exports will recover. Starting this year, growth should increasingly be driven by investment and exports. Gross fixed capital formation is forecast to accelerate to 5.2pc next year and to 6.7pc in 2019. Export growth is likely to increase to 5.8pc next year and 6.6pc the year after. At the same time, imports are expected to grow more slowly next year. Govern\u00adment consumption is forecast to moderate from 11.9pc this year to 9.4pc in 2019.Nightlight intensity is more strongly correlated with economic activity in manufacturing and services than agriculture. The sector of activity that is typically in the dark is agriculture. In developing countries, including South Asia, access to electricity is especially low among farmers. And even when they have access, farmers tend to use the electricity for activities, like water pumping, which do not generate nightlight.When considering a large cross section of countries covering the whole world, the relationship is statistically significant for all three sectors. But it is weaker for agriculture. When focusing on South Asia only, the relationship becomes statistically insignificant for the agricultural sector.Consistent with sluggish growth in the region and still relatively low commodity prices globally, inflation has been subdued in South Asia. The declining trend is somewhat hidden by an annual cycle influenced by the monsoon and its impact on food prices.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "Amin Ahmed", "title": "South Asia no longer world\u2019s fastest-growing region"}}

Under the project, the agriculture and livestock research system at the Arid Zone Research Institute (AZRI), Umerkot, would be strengthened and upgraded to enable it to undertake research leading to the exploration and introduction of such varieties and species. The project was identified under the Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP).Speaking at a ceremony held here on the launching of the project, Senator Shah criticised elected representatives\u2019 indifferent attitude towards issues of growers in Sindh and their failure to provide any relief to this segment. He highlighted importance of new crop and plant varieties and livestock species in improving the lot of farmers, and said this would also greatly help stakeholders cope with food insecurity and climate change impact.He informed the audience that he got the mega project approved in order to help growers of the arid area of Umerkot and Tharparkar stand on their own feet. At the same time, he added, the project would play a key role in averting drought and addressing the issue of food insecurity. According to him, 52 per cent area of Umerkot district is arid and thousands of its residents routinely migrate to other areas along with their families and livestock to escape drought but attention is paid only to Tharparkar in such a situation every year. Considering the fact that Umerkot always remained a neglected area, the need for launching such a project was felt. \u201cThe five-year project will change the destiny of local people and bring about an economic revolution,\u201d he said.Senator Muzaffar Shah noted with concern that the area and its people had remained neglected to such extent that he had never heard of AZRI until 2013 despite the fact that during the period 1985-2013, he held different ministerial portfolios and once held the office of the chief minister. He expressed his pleasure over the progress of the institute over the past few years as it introduced several plant varieties through hectic research. Federal Minister of State for Food Security and Research Syed Ayaz Ali Shah Shirazi said growers of Sindh had been living a miserable life due to abject poverty. He observed that one factor was uncertified seeds and spurious and substandard pesticides being sold to them by unscrupulous elements. Another factor was unavailability of agricultural inputs to them, he added. He urged the Sindh government to initiate stern action against manufacturers and sellers of fake and substandard things which ultimately caused heavy losses to growers.Highlighting the significance of the newly launched project, Mr Shirazi said Umerkot would become identity of Sindh upon its success. He held out the assurance that a campus of the Arid Agriculture University, Rawal\u00adpindi, would be established in Umerkot.Pakistan Agriculture Research Council (PARC) chairman Yousuf Zafar told the audience that by employing drip irrigation, sprinklers and other methods, many fruits, cereals and traditional crops could be grown in Thar and Umerkot as their lands were fertile. He said fish farming in saline water of Thar was done on an experimental basis and this gave better results than expected. AZRI director Dr Attaullah Pathan said that his institution would now ensure introduction and production of new livestock breeds and plant species as well as skill development of growers. He said 100,000 trees would be planted within the arid areas of Umerkot and Tharparkar. He said the institute would also set up 10 labs, a modern library, an auditorium, a glasshouse for tree sampling and lay seven solar-powered tube wells, besides initiating research on camel disease and treatment at Umerkot.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "A.B.

In the reference, filed on Sept 27, the PTI chief has sought Afridi's disqualification from the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Assembly on the grounds that the former minister had confirmed last month that he would be joining the PPP. A five-member bench of the ECP, headed by the chief election commissioner, noted that Afridi had become a member of the KP Assembly on the PTI's ticket. The ECP told Afridi that the reference says he has joined the PPP and asked him to file a written response by October 23.The former minister asked the bench to allow him more time to submit his response as his father is undergoing treatment. In reply, the bench said that a decision on the reference has to be made within 30 days.Nobody from PTI was present at the ECP during Monday's hearing. Earlier in August, Afridi levelled allegations of corruption against KP Chief Minister Pervez Khattak and KP finance minister Muzafar Said and announced that he would soon stage a sit-in outside the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ehtesab Commission (KPEC) offices in the provincial capital to force the anti-corruption body into acting against the two.Afridi had also criticised PTI\u2019s chief Imran Khan and Jamaat-i-Islami emir Sirajul Haq for not taking action against the CM and finance minister over the illegal appointment of the Bank of Khyber\u2019s managing director.The former minister said he had secured \u2018solid\u2019 evidence of the corrupt practices of the KP ruling parties and would soon make them public through media.Afridi had also said that CM had established the KPEC just to victimise his political rivals.In October 2016, Afridi was released on bail after having spent 15 months in prison.He had been arrested by the KPEC on the charges of misusing authority and allowing illegal mining in various areas of the province.While he was in detention, the PTI had suspended A{"1362719": {"date": "October 09, 2017", "article": "Indian forces on Monday claimed to have shot dead a top leader of the Kashmir militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad (JeM) in a suspected clash in the disputed territory.The suspect identified as Khalid was hiding inside a house reportedly after throwing a grenade at a police checkpoint in the northern village of Ladoora, the Indian forces said.Khalid has been accused of organising a string of suicide attacks across India-held Kashmir.\u201cHe was one of the most wanted militants and the chief operational commander of JeM,\u201d Kashmir inspector-general of police, Muneer Ahmed Khan, told AFP.\u201cHe threw a grenade at the checkpoint which failed to explode.
