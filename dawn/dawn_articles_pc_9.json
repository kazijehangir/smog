The fish in Manila Bay, he vowed, would grow fat feeding on corpses. He cited the figure of 100,000 as an appropriate target.Two months into Duterte\u2019s presidency, the toll is believed to stand at about 2,000, with the nation\u2019s police ostensibly responsible for less than half of those killings. Self-ordained vigilantes may account for some of the other deaths, but the police also freely employ contract killers.Last week, the BBC published an interview with \u201ca diminutive, nervous young woman carrying a baby\u201d who is part of a female hit team valued for the ability of its members to \u201cget close to their victims without arousing the same suspicion a man would\u201d. She had thus far killed six people, lately under orders from a police officer.It\u2019s a lucrative profession, each hit rewarded with more than $400, a windfall for the impoverished and the unemployed. It\u2019s also a trap, because there\u2019s no easy way out once you take the plunge.And who exactly are the victims? In his rhetoric, Duterte has often failed to make a clear distinction between kingpins, dealers and addicts. On the campaign trail, asked what he would do if he discovered one of his children was involved in drugs, the candidate spontaneously responded: \u201cI will kill him.\u201d\nDuterte is prone to shooting his mouth off.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t any of his kids, though, but five-year-old Danica May Garcia who was shot dead last week when gunmen on motorbikes came for her grandfather in Dagupan City. The intended target escaped with a wound.During any killing spree, the prospect of innocents getting caught up in the crossfire is almost guaranteed. Even beyond that, though, never mind the identities of those who are being targeted \u2014 be it on the basis of suspicions, rumours, innuendo or local vendettas \u2014 the very idea of state agencies blatantly playing judge, jury and executioner is exceedingly uncivilised.It is not hard to accept that rampant trade in drugs and growing rates of addiction are a serious problem in the Philippines, as they are in so many other countries, the main culprit in this case being what is known as crystal meth or ice, locally known as shabu. But even if one overlooks the rather obvious fact that such problems are invariably at least as much the symptoms as the cause of societal malaise, a crackdown on drug dealing and manufacture should entail arrests, fair trials and commensurate punishment, while addicts deserve treatment rather than elimination.Extreme measures reflect not so much the coercive power of the state machinery as its inadequacies. Furthermore, they tend to backfire. Not only is the Philippines likely to pay a heavy price for the state-sanctioned brutalisation of society to an arguably unprecedented extent, but chances are that the scourge of drugs will not disappear either.One cannot help but acknowledge, though, that this is what Filipinos voted for. Granted, Duterte\u2019s landslide was based on less than 40 per cent of the popular vote, which suggests the majority of the electorate had qualms about endorsing him, but he was well ahead of his rivals. There were at least a few protests when it was indicated that former dictator Ferdinand Marcos, overthrown by a popular uprising 30 years ago, would be interred in a graveyard reserved for martyrs. But the pursuit of the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 with extreme prejudice does not appear to have elicited much of a reaction outside parliament \u2014 perhaps in part because of the fear factor.Both during the campaign and following his inauguration, Duterte has also lived up to his reputation as an exceptionally foul-mouthed politician, with the targets of his crude tongue-lashings ranging from the Pope to the US ambassador in Manila. The Pope effectively turned the other cheek; Washington remonstrated, but only mildly \u2014 after all, the Philippines is a key Asian ally and Subic Bay is once again a regular port of call for US warships amid an unresolved, and quite possibly unnecessary, spat with Beijing over islands in the South China Sea.Duterte is also prone to shooting his mouth off at the United Nations and threatening to quit it, but, interestingly, he has thus far not deemed it fit to publicly insult China. Perhaps he has a reasonably good idea of what he can get away with.Parallels have inevitably been drawn between Duterte and Donald Trump, and a few of them are reasonably valid. The most potent one is that were Trump by some misfortune to be elected in November, the biggest threat to the US would be based in the White House. The Philippines has a head start: the greatest danger to the republic already resides in Malacanang Palace. mahir.dawn@gmail.comPublished in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Mahir Ali", "title": "Vigilante president"}}

The decision was taken in a meeting held on Tuesday in which office-bearers of Pakistan Medical Association, Young Doctors Association, Medical Teachers Association, Young Nurses Association and student representatives were present.On Aug 17, security guards and paramedics of the Allied Hospital allegedly tortured Kandiwal (Chiniot) ASI Danish Jahangir at the surgical emergency ward, ransacked a police post, broke windowpanes of police vehicles and shoved off Lyallpur Town SP Ali Waseem and others who reached the spot after the incident.

However, in reality the SHO was not suspended and the police officials allegedly cheated the doctors who had been demanding justice.They said doctors had complete evidence that the SHO had been performing his duty till to date although he was a suspect and the inquiry was not finalised so far. They said through a summon, police had bound doctors to appear before the SHO who himself was a suspect in the incident.Doctors alleged that SSP (investigation) Dr Farrukh Raza had harassed them next day after the incident by saying that a writ petition had been filed against them. In reality, they said, the petition was filed on Aug 23 which clearly showed that police officials had intentionally been trying to book doctors in the case rather to ensure justice through a fair inquiry. They alleged that police arranged 11 witnesses against the doctors. Doctors will hold a press conference on Wednesday (today) and announce their future course of action.The SSP told Dawn, \u201cDoctors are a respectable section of society and I genuinely respect them from the core of my heart and can never think of harassing them.

{"1281159": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\nTHE report of the Committee on Fata Reforms, that has rightly been made public via the website of the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron), needs to be studied with great care because bold strokes of policy sometimes run dangerously close to rashness.The committee was set up in November 2015 and the completion of its report within 10 months is quite creditable. However, greater thinking was perhaps needed before the committee\u2019s composition and the process of consultation with stakeholders were finalised.Headed by foreign policy adviser Sartaj Aziz, the committee comprised Governor Jhagra (and governor Abbasi before him), Safron Minister (retired) Lt-Gen Abdul Qadir Baloch, Law Minister Zahid Hamid, National Security Adviser (retired) Lt-Gen Nasser Janjua, and Safron secretary Muhammad Shehzad Arbab. It might have been better if these government heavyweights had been joined by a couple of non-government representatives.The committee held consultations with the maliks and elders in the tribal agencies and frontier regions, \u201crepresentatives of all political parties and other members of the civil society, including traders, media representatives, and youth\u201d. Since the report does not identify the people the committee consulted it is not possible to determine their representative character. Parliamentarians from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or from any other region, or organisations such as lawyers\u2019 associations, were apparently not consulted.\nOne should like to see a wide-ranging discussion on what Fata will become under the \u2018rewaj\u2019 rule.\n\nThe report takes brief note of the Naseerullah Babar proposals of 1976 (which would have \u201csucceeded had the military coup of 1977 not occurred\u201d); extension of adult franchise to Fata in 1996 and of the Local Government Ordinance in 2002; the Sahibzada Imtiaz Ahmad report of 2006; the Fata sustainable development plan of 2006; retired justice Ajmal Mian\u2019s report of 2008; a report by the Shaheed Bhutto Foundation of 2008 and the Political Parties\u2019 Joint Commission of 2013; and the report of the governor\u2019s Fata reform commission of 2015. All these efforts sought to reform the FCR and that is the present committee\u2019s main concern too.The committee has proposed restricted integration of Fata with KP as the territory will be subject to a special law, to be called the tribal areas rewaj act, which will replace the FCR. \u201cProvisions relating to collective responsibility in the FCR should be omitted from the new act,\u201d says the report and adds that the \u201cjurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Peshawar High Court should be extended to Fata\u201d.The committee has recommended that \u201cthe \u2018jirga\u2019 system should be retained for both civil and criminal matters, whereby the judge [which judge?] will appoint a council of elders to decide factual issues in accordance with rewaj and will pass a decree in accordance with its findings on civil reference or pass an order in accordance with its findings and applicable law in a criminal reference\u201d. This crudely drafted formulation is unlikely to pass scrutiny by sticklers for due process.The buzzword for Fata now is rewaj. We recently heard this word when two men were acquitted of murder by a political agent because the jirga had held that the rewaj permitted homicide in the name of \u2018honour\u2019 or ghairat.One should like to see a wide-ranging discussion on what Fata will become under the rewaj rule. If the proposed rewaj act will legitimise the tribal customary law, how will the tribal people be integrated with the population of KP? The people in that province will be yoked under three different and often contradictory justice systems \u2014 the Pakistan laws, nizam-i-adl in Malakand Division and the rewaj in the tribal areas.Well-informed sources maintain that a United Nations agency has played a significant role in the drafting of the rewaj act. If this is true, the involvement of United Nations personnel would be difficult to justify for producing a law that offends against the principles of law and justice advocated by the international champion of non-discriminatory legal systems.The committee says that it \u201chas proposed retention of the jirga system in the civil and criminal justice system of Fata for the reason that its repeal would be resisted and destabilise the social order, which is undesirable\u201d. The committee hopes that the jirga \u201cwill develop into the jury system\u201d and also boldly proclaims that \u201cany legal instrument, which incorporates the rewaj as part of the judicial process, must ensure that it is not in conflict with fundamental rights as well as other substantive laws administered in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u201d.No amount of jugglery with words can hide the fact that the rewaj law will legitimise deviations from the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and will discriminate between the people of Fata and their compatriots within the province of KP and outside it.Strangely enough, the committee is worried only about resistance to the repeal of the jirga system. One wonders whether the committee took into consideration the resistance that the plan for land settlement could run into. As regards the extension of Pakistan laws to Fata, the committee might not have been unaware of the strange case of the extension of custom laws to Malakand Division and the government\u2019s hasty retreat there.Mainstreaming Fata has been on the agenda for decades. The reform committee is proposing the territory\u2019s integration (even though partially) with KP at a time when external factors may not be conducive to a substantive change in the life of the tribal people. It may not be prudent to ignore the possible reaction of Afghanistan to the process and its impact on the section of the population that has not concealed its opposition to merger with KP. Even the memorandum of Fata parliamentarians included in the report refers to two options \u2014 integration with KP or creation of a new province. As a senior lawyer from the Malakand division told the present writer, Fata\u2019s future cannot be decided without substantial revamping of the country\u2019s foreign and defence policies.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "I.A.

{"1281479": {"date": "September 02, 2016", "article": "Eighteenth century is on several counts considered a turning point in the history of India in general and that of Punjab in particular. During this period we discern early signs of end of an era and beginning of a new age that transformed the landscape of the subcontinent in a fundamental way. The beginning of the end of Mughal Empire signalled vanishing of the Muslim rule mainly established and sustained by central Asian Turks, last of who were the Chaghatais. The Chaghatais in a strange twist of fate came to be known as Mughals who, in fact, were their rivals but in Punjab they were called by their correct clannish name, \u201cChaugatta\u201d. \u201cAfter the death of Aurangzeb early in the 18th century, the Mughal Empire started a gradual decline\u2026 struck to death by Muslim intolerance and Hindu revivals, destroyed also by internecine quarrels\u2026 The last blow was delivered by the great ruler of Persia, Nadir Shah, whose invasion and sack of Delhi destroyed what was left of the wealth, power and prestige of the Moghul Emperors. One by one, the various provinces, feudatory states, both Hindu and Muslim, rose against a disintegrating central power---. None of the new states was strong enough to unite India, and a last great war between the Marathas and invading Muslim Afghans shattered the former, leaving a profoundly divided \nIndia\u2026,\u201d writes Amaury De Riencourt in his \u2018The Soul of India\u2019. In addition to the pervasive devastation caused by the brutal armies of Nadir Shah in 1739, Punjab suffered a great destruction at the hands of Afghan marauder Ahmad Shah Abdali also surnamed Durrani. In order to keep his newly established Afghan kingdom, poor and cash-starved, in a functional state, he desperately needed resources and there was no place better than India which offered him the prospect of getting what he wanted. Punjab, the traditional gateway to India, bore the brunt of his repeated attacks which were no less than seven from 1748 to 1767. Bulleh Shah (1680- 1757) in his youth witnessed the withering away of regional and central authority in Lahore and Delhi. As a consequence of centrifugal forces, India became more vulnerable and thus attracted more invasions by the hostile foreign forces which in turn created further chaos, social disintegration and political anarchy. Highly valuable and hair-raising description of Nadir Shah\u2019s invasion can be glimpsed while reading the great epic poem \u201cNijabat di Var (also called Nadir Shah di Var)\u201d by poet Nijabat with an acute sense of history and creative finesse underpinned by strong feelings of patriotism. His portrayal of interplay of diverse historical forces reveals the deep fault lines Indian society suffered from. The level and intensity of carnage in Punjab in the wake of Ahmad Shah\u2019s invasions can be gauged from this famous folk saying: \u201cKhahda peeta laahi da, baaqi Ahmad shahi da (what you eat can be of benefit to you, the remaining will be taken away by Ahmad Shah)\u201d. In his later years, Bulleh Shah saw the unrestrained plundering of his beloved Punjab by Nadir Shah and Ahmad Shah. It was not only the foreign forces that continued savagely mauling Punjab, the rising indigenous forces too added to the unbearable chaos and political uncertainty. Marathas, after battering the Mughul power, wreaked havoc on the north western India. They, in collusion with Adina Baig (an astute political player from Sharaqpur), and Sikh bands (Jathas) invaded Punjab. They captured and sacked Lahore in 1758. Timur Shah Durrani and Jahan Khan, the Afghan chiefs, had already fled in panic after the fall of Sirhind to Maratha army. \u201c\u2026 \nTimur Shah Durrani, son of Ahmad Shah Durrani, and Jahan Khan have been pursued by our troops and their troops completely looted. Both of them have reached Peshawar with a few broken troops\u2026We have decided to extend our rule to Kandahar\u201d, writes Raghunathrao in his letter to Maratha Peshwa on May, 4, 1758 from Lahore. Furious Ahmad Shah retaliated by storming India yet again and completely smashed the Maratha forces led by Peshwa Balaji Baji Rao\u2019s cousin in the Third Battle of Panipat. Bulleh Shah, despite his mystic disposition, keenly observed uncanny political developments. He was neither impartial nor a spectator. He took sides lending his voice to expressing the miseries of the people who suffered at the hands of their tormentors, alien and indigenous, in a violent free-for-all. He had nothing but disdain for the old order which was going fast into free fall. \u201cThe Mogul royals drank the hemlock/the brown-blanketed have shaped up as the rulers/all the nobles go around in silence/seeing them dislodged makes a good spectacle,\u201d he says in one of his lyrics. The fire we see in his verses in fact reflects the conflagration that was all around him consuming all the things, small and big, sacred and profane. \nPunjab, his home, was on the boil. \u201cNow hell has opened its bogs/Punjab has gone to the dogs/this hell is the nethermost hell/come see me once in a while,\u201d (translation by Taufiq Rafat) that is how he describes the unbearable situation in his homeland. Defiance, resentment, anger and anguish that give a haunting quality to Bulleh Shah\u2019s poetry are not a result of deciphering of some arcane secrets but rather the product of his historical consciousness which makes him see the things as they are. He, aided by his intuitive faculty and imaginative sweep, goes a step further by unmasking the things in a bid to expose the reality that lies buried beneat{"1281009": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "WASHINGTON: Russian-based hackers may have been responsible for two recent attempts to breach US voter registration databases in two states, raising fears Moscow is trying to undermine November\u2019s presidential election, US media said on Monday.The incidents led the FBI to send a \u201cflash alert\u201d to election officials earlier this month, asking them to watch for similar cyber-attacks.

But the pursuit of the \u2018war on drugs\u2019 with extreme prejudice does not appear to have elicited much of a reaction outside parliament \u2014 perhaps in part because of the fear factor.Both during the campaign and following his inauguration, Duterte has also lived up to his reputation as an exceptionally foul-mouthed politician, with the targets of his crude tongue-lashings ranging from the Pope to the US ambassador in Manila. The Pope effectively turned the other cheek; Washington remonstrated, but only mildly \u2014 after all, the Philippines is a key Asian ally and Subic Bay is once again a regular port of call for US warships amid an unresolved, and quite possibly unnecessary, spat with Beijing over islands in the South China Sea.Duterte is also prone to shooting his mouth off at the United Nations and threatening to quit it, but, interestingly, he has thus far not deemed it fit to publicly insult China. Perhaps he has a reasonably good idea of what he can get away with.Parallels have inevitably been drawn between Duterte and Donald Trump, and a few of them are reasonably valid. The most potent one is that were Trump by some misfortune to be elected in November, the biggest threat to the US would be based in the White House. The Philippines has a head start: the greatest danger to the republic already resides in Malacanang Palace. mahir.dawn@gmail.comPublished in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Mahir Ali", "title": "Vigilante president"}}

Office-bearers of the rights body took out rallies in the 10 cities where it has offices. HRCP Secretary-General I. A. Rehman said: \u201cSri Lanka\u2019s ratification of the Convention on Enforced Disappearance and its pledge to criminalise the practice is a welcome step. He said other states in the region should follow suit and show that they are serious about their commitment to human rights by making enforced disappearance a specific crime in their domestic law. \nProtests in 10 cities mark victims\u2019 day\n\nAccording to a press release, a conference on \u2018Enforced and Involuntary Disappearances\u2019, organised by the International Commission of Jurists (ICJ) and HRCP, was held earlier and lawyers and activists from Bangladesh, India, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka had observed that large-scale enforced disappearances in South Asia can only be addressed if all governments in the region immediately criminalise this serious human rights violation. Tens of thousands of cases have been documented in Sri Lanka, Nepal, Pakistan and India and since 2009 and there has also been a surge in enforced disappearances in Bangladesh. \u201cUnder international law, an enforced disappearance is the arrest, abduction or detention by State agents, or by people acting with the authorisation, support or acquiescence of the State, followed by a refusal to acknowledge the detention or by concealing the fate or whereabouts of the disappeared person which places the person outside the protection of the law. \u201cIn Pakistan, the practice of enforced disappearances has in recent years become a nationwide problem. While mostly prevalent in Balochistan, the federally and provincially administered tribal areas and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, a number of cases are now also being reported from Sindh. To date, not a single perpetrator has been held to account.\u201d A brochure, which the HRCP distributed during its Lahore protest, says disappearances are still widespread and it could be proven through the proceedings of the National Commission on Disappearances. According to the commission\u2019s record, there has been 2,584 disappearances during March 1, 2011 and July 2016. The KP accounts for the highest number with 1,362 disappearances, Sindh 965, Punjab 682, Balochistan 265, Fata 101, Azad Kashmir 36, Islamabad 36 and Gilgit-Baltistan 1. It only proves that problem is still not only prevalent but worsening, it claims. In Nepal, even after 10 years since the end of the armed conflict, the fate and whereabouts of more than a 1,000 possible victims of enforced disappearance remain unknown and perpetrators have still not been brought to justice. In India, between 1989 and 2009, more than 8,000 enforced and involuntary disappearances were reported in Kashmir alone. Many cases have also been reported in the northeast of India, particularly in Manipur. Immunities granted by the Armed Forces Special Powers Act (AFSPA), in addition to other laws, have made prosecuting suspected perpetrators close to impossible. Since 2009, there has also been a surge in enforced disappearances in Bangladesh, with reports of dozens of opposition political activists, human rights defenders students and journalists being \u201cdisappeared\u201d. Sri Lanka has the highest incidence of enforced disappearances in the world as a result of its decades-long conflict. \nIn 2015, Sri Lanka became the first South Asian state to ratify the International Convention on the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearances. The UN General Assembly has repeatedly described enforced disappearance as \u201can offence to human dignity\u201d. \u201cDespite thousands of cases of enforced disappearances across South Asia, the governments have failed to follow their legal obligation to treat these crimes as the serious human rights violation they are,\u201d said Sam Zarifi, ICJ\u2019s Asia Director.\u201c South Asian governments have done very little to support the victims and survivors of enforced \ndisappearance, or to ensure the rights of their family members to truth, justice and reparation.\u201d A comprehensive set of reforms, both in law and policy, is required to end the entrenched impunity for enforced disappearances in the region and criminalising the practice would be a significant first step, said ICJ and the HRCP.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter", "title": "HRCP for criminalisation of enforced disappearance"}}

The new rule was set by ICAO to speed up travel time and strengthen security. However, the deadline was extended to October 1, 2016.Mr Shami complained to the members that since February the Foreign Office had been asking the Ministry of Interior and Nadra to take up the matter. However, neither the ministry nor Nadra has so far responded to the concern.\u201cThe Foreign Office urges this committee to direct the Ministry of Interior to take necessary steps or else many Pakistanis will face a lot of problems.

It became a matter of concern when these workers could not get food and were denied health facilities in the 20 camps in various cities of Saudi Arabia.Minister for Overseas Pakistanis and Human Resource Development Pir Sadruddin Shah informed the meeting that two companies which employed the 8,500 Pakistanis were facing cash flow problems after a dip in the oil prices.Most of the members regretted that the Foreign Office and the Ministry of Overseas Pakistanis had failed to address the concerns of the workers.\u201cGod knows how many more days would have gone by had the issue not been highlighted in the media.

He said because of the blunder, plot buyers had been facing problems. To this, representatives of the FBR said they would rectify the mistake. \u201cBy today evening, we will issue a revised notification,\u201d one of the FBR representatives told the committee.

As per the CDA rules, the owner of an agro-farm is allowed to construct on up to 4,850 square feet. The remaining 20pc of the area is meant for agriculture, such as growing vegetables, fruits, poultry etc. The committee members observed that because of CDA\u2019s lethargic approach, the owners of farmhouses had constructed palatial buildings and were not producing vegetables and fruits. \u201cThe CDA allotted the farmhouse lands to meet the vegetable needs of the Islamabad but now most of the farmhouses have become centres of entertainment and parties,\u201d said Senator Shahi Syed. The committee also took notice of 43 brick kilns operating in sectors H-16 and 1-17.

The programme showed better results under which they had paid Rs45 million to women so far, he said.Dr Sahib Gul said that Punjab and Sindh wanted the programme for their rural centres as it had led to increase in mother child OPDs after the announcement of the cash. \u201cMost of the government health facilities are situated within four to five kilometers of distance. The amount, given to all visiting women regardless of their financial status, helps families to hire vehicle to shift pregnant women on time to hospital and prevent complications,\u201d he said.He said that the innovative initiative was studied by both the provinces to utilise the health facilities, which were not visited by people before. \u201cIt has increased utility of our OPDs,\u201d he said.

The objections raised by the court office were identical to the ones highlighted when the JI petition was returned, i.e. the petition, prima facie (on the face of it), appeared to be frivolous.The petition, which was filed in the name of PTI chairman Imran Khan, sought the disqualification of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, his son-in-law retired Captain Mohammad Safdar and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.\u201cThat this petition prima facie appears to be a frivolous petition within the contemplation of Order XVII Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980,\u201d explained the order issued by the registrar\u2019s office when the petition was returned.Under the Rule 5 of Order XVII, the registrar has the authority to refuse to receive a petition on the grounds that it has not been filed in accordance with the rules, or is frivolous, or contains scandalous matter.Under the same rules, the petitioner has the right to move an appeal within a fortnight of the petition\u2019s return, which would then be heard by a judge of the apex court in his chambers.\u201cAll these questions ought to have been decided by the court and not the registrar\u2019s office,\u201d senior PTI leader Ishaq Khakwani told Dawn.The registrar had violated the Constitution, he said, adding that the party\u2019s legal team was carefully analysing the registrar\u2019s objections and would soon file an appeal against the order.Mr Khakwani recalled that earlier scores of cases were entertained by the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) and such objections were never raised by the registrar\u2019s office. \u201cWe have every reason to believe that the registrar has acted in bad faith,\u201d he regretted.Separately, party spokesperson Naeemul Haq announced that a legal team headed by senior counsel Hamid Khan was in the process of finalising an appeal against the registrar\u2019s order, which would be moved soon.On Aug 27, the court office declined to accept a petition moved by JI emir Sirajul Haq, where he had asked the Supreme Court to declare the illegal transfer of national wealth for investments in offshore companies an offence under Section 9 of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO).On May 13, the Supreme Court returned a somewhat similar request from the federal government, asking the court to appoint a commission of inquiry to conduct a probe into the Panamagate affair, on the grounds that any such commission formed under the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act, 1956 would result in the constitution of a toothless commission that would serve no useful purpose, except bringing a bad name to the judiciary.The court had also declared the terms of reference \u2014 sent to it by the government under public pressure \u2014 \u201cwide and open-ended\u201d, saying that it might take years for such a commission to close its proceedings.On Tuesday, the court office informed the applicants that the petitioner was directly invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution \u2014 that deals with the \u2018enforcement of fundamental rights\u2019 \u2013 which is not permissible in light of the precedent laid down in the 1998 matter of Zulfikar Mehdi vs PIA.In that case, the apex court had interpreted the term \u2018public importance\u2019 and laid down that the expression should be viewed with reference to freedom and liberties guaranteed under the Constitution, their protection and the invasion of these rights in a manner which raises serious questions regarding their enforcement.The issues arising in a case cannot be considered questions of public importance if a decision on those issues only affects the rights of an individual or a group of individuals, the judgement had held.In its order, the registrar office also stated that the petitioner had approached the Supreme Court without first approaching an appropriate forum under the law, not did the petitioner provide any justification for not approaching any other forum.Similarly, the certificate provided by the petitioner alongside the petition did not fulfil the requirements of Rule 6 of Order XXV of the Supreme Court rules.This rule requires the applicant to state in clear terms whether the petitioner has moved the concerned high court for the same relief, and if so, what was the result.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Nasir Iqbal", "title": "SC returns PTI\u2019s \u2018frivolous\u2019 petition"}}

{"1281149": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "NOTTINGHAM: Alex Hales does not expect to be an England record-holder for long after his 171 helped the team post a new world One-Day International (ODI) mark of 444 for three en route to thrashing Pakistan on Tuesday. Hales's innings at his home ground of Trent Bridge was the highest score by any England batsman in this format and helped the hosts to a 169-run win that ensured they won the series at 3-0 up with two to play. But Hales believes it's just a matter of time before an England colleague betters his score. \u201cI think the improvements we've shown in the last couple of years, I'm not sure how long that record will stand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe batting we've got all the way down to pretty much number 11 so it's an exciting time for us as a team.\u201d Jos Buttler made a dashing 90 not out, that included England's fastest ODI 50 \u2014 off just 22 balls.Partnerships of 248 between Hales and Joe Root (85) and an unbroken 161 shared by Buttler and England captain Eoin Morgan (57 not out) overwhelmed Pakistan's bowlers in a total featuring 16 sixes. Read: This is why the Pakistani ODI team is ranked No. 9This was a timely innings for Hales, who had managed just 145 runs at an average of 18.12 during England's preceding 2-2 Test series with Pakistan. That was followed by meagre scores of seven and 14 in the first two ODIs at Southampton and Lord's respectively. But back in front of his Nottinghamshire home crowd, the opener looked a far more confident and authoritative batsman as Robin Smith's 167 not out against Australia at Edgbaston back in 1993 finally ceased to be England's highest individual ODI score. \u201cIt's been a tough few weeks personally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Test series didn't go to plan \u2014 but when it comes to the white ball in the last 12 months, I've felt in good form. \u201cI was always confident heading into this series, and it's nice to put it right tonight.\u201d Jason Roy, Hales' opening partner had gone close to breaking Smith's record with 162 against Sri Lanka at The Oval \u2014 his home ground \u2014 in June. \u201cI knew I was I closing in,\u201d said Hales. \u201cWhen I heard the cheer going round the ground I knew something was happening, but at the time I was unaware,\u201d he added of the moment he broke Smith's longstanding record. \u201cIt's a special feeling.\u201d '444 is a bit too much'\nThis victory was further evidence of the progress England have made in 50-over cricket since their dismal first-round exit at last year's World Cup. And Hales believes there is better to come from the 2019 World Cup hosts. \u201cIt's exciting for us as I don't think we've reached our full potential yet. We're still learning with the bat and ball and still improving in the field so hopefully there's a lot more to come in the next two years,\u201d Hales said. A delighted Morgan added: \u201cTo score 171 in any form of the game \u2014 particularly a 50-over game \u2014 is remarkable. \u201cInternational cricket's about how you go through the tough times and how you manage them \u2014 certainly today he (Hales) has come back really well from them.\u201d Pakistan captain Azhar Ali praised Hales and Buttler but accepted his own side's fielding had been well below the required standard. \u201cIt was an exceptional innings from Alex Hales and Jos Buttler,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think 444 is a bit too much. \u201cI think we missed some key chances \u2014 especially that (Wahab Riaz) no-ball when we would have got rid of Alex Hales on about 70. \u201cWe didn't start well, and there's no excuse for that. Those fielding lapses straightaway didn't send a good message.\u201d\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Hales backs England to keep on breaking records"}}
{"1281159": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\nTHE report of the Committee on Fata Reforms, that has rightly been made public via the website of the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron), needs to be studied with great care because bold strokes of policy sometimes run dangerously close to rashness.The committee was set up in November 2015 and the completion of its report within 10 months is quite creditable. However, greater thinking was perhaps needed before the committee\u2019s composition and the process of consultation with stakeholders were finalised.Headed by foreign policy adviser Sartaj Aziz, the committee comprised Governor Jhagra (and governor Abbasi before him), Safron Minister (retired) Lt-Gen Abdul Qadir Baloch, Law Minister Zahid Hamid, National Security Adviser (retired) Lt-Gen Nasser Janjua, and Safron secretary Muhammad Shehzad Arbab. It might have been better if these government heavyweights had been joined by a couple of non-government representatives.The committee held consultations with the maliks and elders in the tribal agencies and frontier regions, \u201crepresentatives of all political parties and other members of the civil society, including traders, media representatives, and youth\u201d. Since the report does not identify the people the committee consulted it is not possible to determine their representative character. Parliamentarians from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or from any other region, or organisations such as lawyers\u2019 associations, were apparently not consulted.\nOne should like to see a wide-ranging discussion on what Fata will become under the \u2018rewaj\u2019 rule.\n\nThe report takes brief note of the Naseerullah Babar proposals of 1976 (which would have \u201csucceeded had the military coup of 1977 not occurred\u201d); extension of adult franchise to Fata in 1996 and of the Local Government Ordinance in 2002; the Sahibzada Imtiaz Ahmad report of 2006; the Fata sustainable development plan of 2006; retired justice Ajmal Mian\u2019s report of 2008; a report by the Shaheed Bhutto Foundation of 2008 and the Political Parties\u2019 Joint Commission of 2013; and the report of the governor\u2019s Fata reform commission of 2015. All these efforts sought to reform the FCR and that is the present committee\u2019s main concern too.The committee has proposed restricted integration of Fata with KP as the territory will be subject to a special law, to be called the tribal areas rewaj act, which will replace the FCR. \u201cProvisions relating to collective responsibility in the FCR should be omitted from the new act,\u201d says the report and adds that the \u201cjurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Peshawar High Court should be extended to Fata\u201d.The committee has recommended that \u201cthe \u2018jirga\u2019 system should be retained for both civil and criminal matters, whereby the judge [which judge?] will appoint a council of elders to decide factual issues in accordance with rewaj and will pass a decree in accordance with its findings on civil reference or pass an order in accordance with its findings and applicable law in a criminal reference\u201d. This crudely drafted formulation is unlikely to pass scrutiny by sticklers for due process.The buzzword for Fata now is rewaj. We recently heard this word when two men were acquitted of murder by a political agent because the jirga had held that the rewaj permitted homicide in the name of \u2018honour\u2019 or ghairat.One should like to see a wide-ranging discussion on what Fata will become under the rewaj rule. If the proposed rewaj act will legitimise the tribal customary law, how will the tribal people be integrated with the population of KP? The people in that province will be yoked under three different and often contradictory justice systems \u2014 the Pakistan laws, nizam-i-adl in Malakand Division and the rewaj in the tribal areas.Well-informed sources maintain that a United Nations agency has played a significant role in the drafting of the rewaj act. If this is true, the involvement of United Nations personnel would be difficult to justify for producing a law that offends against the principles of law and justice advocated by the international champion of non-discriminatory legal systems.The committee says that it \u201chas proposed retention of the jirga system in the civil and criminal justice system of Fata for the reason that its repeal would be resisted and destabilise the social order, which is undesirable\u201d. The committee hopes that the jirga \u201cwill develop into the jury system\u201d and also boldly proclaims that \u201cany legal instrument, which incorporates the rewaj as part of the judicial process, must ensure that it is not in conflict with fundamental rights as well as other substantive laws administered in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u201d.No amount of jugglery with words can hide the fact that the rewaj law will legitimise deviations from the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and will discriminate between the people of Fata and their compatriots within the province of KP and outside it.Strangely enough, the committee is worried only about resistance to the repeal of the jirga system. One wonders whether the committee took into consideration the resistance that the plan for land settlement could run into. As regards the extension of Pakistan laws to Fata, the committee might not have been unaware of the strange case of the extension of custom laws to Malakand Division and the government\u2019s hasty retreat there.Mainstreaming Fata has been on the agenda for decades. The reform committee is proposing the territory\u2019s integration (even though partially) with KP at a time when external factors may not be conducive to a substantive change in the life of the tribal people. It may not be prudent to ignore the possible reaction of Afghanistan to the process and its impact on the section of the population that has not concealed its opposition to merger with KP. Even the memorandum of Fata parliamentarians included in the report refers to two options \u2014 integration with KP or creation of a new province. As a senior lawyer from the Malakand division told the present writer, Fata\u2019s future cannot be decided without substantial revamping of the country\u2019s foreign and defence policies.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "I.A.

For example, there is no systematic route from Mingora to Saidu. Those wishing to go to Saidu have to travel further beyond their destination before making their way back, for lack of a proper stopping point at Saidu. Traffic policemen compound the issue by preventing commuters from stopping at their intended destination. The provincial government needs to build interval stops, just like bus stops in metropolitan areas, for pickups and rickshaws to be able to stop and drop passengers whose intended destination is Saidu, instead of forcing them to be inconvenienced. This will doubly benefit commuters as proper stopping points will reduce the frequency of illegally parked vehicles that currently pose a safety problem on the road.

World number one Serena started her bid for a record-breaking 23rd major title opened her account with a tidy 6-3, 6-3 win over 29th-ranked Ekaterina Makarova, to join her sister Venus in the second round of the year\u2019s final Grand Slam. The US world number one appeared untroubled by the balky right shoulder that has hindered her in recent weeks, delivering a dozen aces and 27 winners overall in the 63-minute contest. \u201cI knew today I needed to be focused because I\u2019ve played her. She\u2019s gotten to the semi-finals. She goes deep in majors,\u201d Serena said of the Russian left-hander who beat her in the fourth round of the 2012 Australian Open. Serena is chasing a record seventh title on the hardcourts of Flushing Meadows where she first triumphed in 1999. A victory would see her break the Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam titles she now shares with German Steffi Graf and close in on Margaret Court\u2019s all-time mark of 24 major titles. While Serena has struggled since Wimbledon, Murray went from claiming a second title at the All England club to a successful defence of his Olympic gold in Rio. Vying to become the fourth man in the Open Era to reach all four major finals in a calendar year, Murray, too, produced a dominant service performance in a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Czech Lukas Rosol. \u201cI don\u2019t think I had any break points against me, which is very good,\u201d the Scot said. Before the floodlights came up, Serena\u2019s elder sister Venus claimed a Grand Slam record of her own as her 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 victory over Ukraine\u2019s Kateryna Kozlova marked her 72nd appearance in the main draw of a major. The 36-year-old Venus, enjoying a resurgence in a 2016 season that includes a WTA title in Taiwan, survived 63 unforced errors against the rising 22-year-old, although she was pleased that her aggressive approach also yielded 46 winners. \u201cThe good part is I\u2019m playing the game I want to play, I\u2019m playing aggressively and moving forward,\u201d Venus said. BOUCHARD OUT Fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland, trying to make it to the quarter-finals in New York for the first time, breezed past US qualifier Jessica Pegula 6-1, 6-1 and fifth-seeded Romanian Simona Halep also eased through with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over Belgian Kirsten Flipkens. But Eugenie Bouchard, the 2014 Wimbledon runner-up, was tripped up 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 by 20-year-old Czech Katerina Siniakova in a match filled with 46 unforced errors by the Canadian. There were various upsets around the grounds during the afternoon, including 19-year-old American Jared Donaldson\u2019s 4-6, 7-5, 6-4, 6-0 elimination of 12th-seeded David Goffin, and a loss by No 29 Sam Querrey. Three seeded women departed, including former world number one and 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic. Men\u2019s third seed Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland, a two-time semi-finalist, reached the second round with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 6-4 win over Spain\u2019s Fernando Verdasco. Kei Nishikori, who became Asia\u2019s first men\u2019s Grand Slam finalist in New York in 2014, when he fell to Marin Cilic in the final, also advanced, downing German Benjamin Becker 6-1, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Eighth-seeded Dominic Thiem of Austria needed five sets to secure his second-round spot, downing Australia\u2019s John Millman 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3. Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 US Open champion whose career was nearly ended by three wrist surgeries, advanced with a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) victory over fellow Argentine Diego Schwartzman. There was a little record-setting on the men\u2019s side as well, with Croatian Ivo Karlovic belting a US Open record of 61 aces in a 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/5), 7-5 win over Taiwan\u2019s Lu Yen-Hsun.

The government has been relying heavily on banking money to meet liquidity requirements. The practice continues but not with zest as the emphasis has shifted to borrowing from the State Bank of Pakistan.The government can probably borrow more liberally from the central bank now after completion of agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF used to be critical of borrowing from the central bank.The government has actually been retiring the banking debts. Since the maturity of Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) was about Rs1.2 trillion during June and July, the repayments required more borrowing.However, the banks have shown no change in their investment strategy and despite sharp fall in the returns of both T-bills and PIBs, they show willingness to park maximum liquidity in the government papers.In this auction, the banks offered Rs309bn to invest. The highest amount of Rs79.7bn was raised for benchmark six-month T-bills at a cut-off yield of 5.9 per cent, followed by Rs61bn for three-month tenor at a cut-off yield of 5.85pc and Rs32.6bn for 12-month papers at a cut-off yield of 5.91pc.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "The Newspaper's Staff Reporter", "title": "Govt raises Rs173bn through T-bills"}}

He has climbed K2 and summited Everest five times and on August 4, the 30-year-old also summited Gasherbrum-I in Pakistan. His eight-person expedition was the only one to summit GI so far this year, and half the team also summited Gasherbrum-II. Mr Gyalje Sherpa intends to return to Pakistan to summit Broad Peak in 2017, and climb GII and Nanga Parbat in 2018.Q: How is the job of a Nepali Sherpa different from high altitude Pakistani porters?A: Unlike Pakistani high altitude porters, Nepali Sherpas do the difficult job of determining and then establishing the route, and then going up first to fix ropes. This is time consuming and difficult. All the expedition members have to do is follow the route and climb, hanging on to the ropes Sherpas have already fixed.Q: Why do both veteran and amateur mountaineers prefer to hire the services of Nepali Sherpas over Pakistani climbers?A: Mountaineering is a highly specialized and technical sport in Nepal. There are 43 internationally certified Nepali Sherpas while there are none in Pakistan. The non-certified Nepali Sherpas are also highly trained. Climbers in Pakistan can no doubt reach to the top, but they lack the basic mountaineering knowledge and training. This year I needed seven professional climbers from Pakistan to assist my expedition, I found only two and even they had to be taught how to tie knots while fixing ropes. Climbing is a dangerous sport. Foreign expeditions cannot put their trust in someone who lacks basic mountaineering knowledge and training.Q: How can Pakistani high altitude climbers become as good as Nepali Sherpas?A: Tibet faced the same problem. Then local Tibetans started climbing with Nepali Sherpas and were trained. A decade later, Tibetans could call themselves professional climbers and foreign expeditions could trust Tibetan climbers as much as they did Nepali Sherpas. Maybe a similar solution can be worked out here and in five to six years Pakistani climbers can become professionals. It makes sense to hire a Pakistani climber for $4,000 to $5,000 than hire a Nepali Sherpa for $12, 000. Given proper training, Pakistani climbers can easily replace Nepali Sherpas in Pakistan.Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Jamal Shahid", "title": "LIVING COLOURS: \u2018Mountaineering is a highly specialised, technical sport in Nepal\u2019"}}

The letter emphasised that the Supreme Court must ensure the rights of the people of Balochistan, especially their right to life as guaranteed under Article 9 of the Constitution.However, the registrar\u2019s note did not mention either the letter or the PBC demand, but stated that the incident had raised doubts about the state of governance in Balochistan, and indeed the whole country.But the tone and tenor of the registrar\u2019s note is quite similar to Justice Chaudhry\u2019s letter.\u201cThe way the planned incident took place brings into question the efficacy of the state machinery. Lack of security arrangements, despite past precedents, points at the miserable failure of the provincial government and law \nenforcement agencies to avert the tragic incident,\u201d the registrar regretted.He went on to say that the lack of proper security arrangements by the administration constituted a violation of the fundamental right to life and liberty, guaranteed under Article 9 of the Constitution.Moreover, insufficient arrangements and medical facilities in the hospital of the provincial headquarters resulted in further loss of life as the seriously injured were compelled to shift from the Civil Hospital to the Combined Military Hospital and other hospitals outside the province, the note said.The post-disaster scenario is also not encouraging either, the registrar observed, saying it appeared the incident had been forgotten and no headway had been made; either in tracing the culprits or mobilising state resources to prevent such tragedies in future. The note also said that there was no evidence that the provincial government had taken any cognisance of the matter.After going through the note, CJP Jamali ordered the court office to fix the matter before the court on Sept 20, issuing notices to the Balochistan chief secretary, advocate general and IGP.Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Nasir Iqbal", "title": "SC takes suo motu notice of Quetta carnage"}}

Hales's innings at his home ground of Trent Bridge was the highest score by any England batsman in this format and helped the hosts to a 169-run win that ensured they won the series at 3-0 up with two to play. But Hales believes it's just a matter of time before an England colleague betters his score. \u201cI think the improvements we've shown in the last couple of years, I'm not sure how long that record will stand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe batting we've got all the way down to pretty much number 11 so it's an exciting time for us as a team.\u201d Jos Buttler made a dashing 90 not out, that included England's fastest ODI 50 \u2014 off just 22 balls.Partnerships of 248 between Hales and Joe Root (85) and an unbroken 161 shared by Buttler and England captain Eoin Morgan (57 not out) overwhelmed Pakistan's bowlers in a total featuring 16 sixes. Read: This is why the Pakistani ODI team is ranked No. 9This was a timely innings for Hales, who had managed just 145 runs at an average of 18.12 during England's preceding 2-2 Test series with Pakistan. That was followed by meagre scores of seven and 14 in the first two ODIs at Southampton and Lord's respectively. But back in front of his Nottinghamshire home crowd, the opener looked a far more confident and authoritative batsman as Robin Smith's 167 not out against Australia at Edgbaston back in 1993 finally ceased to be England's highest individual ODI score. \u201cIt's been a tough few weeks personally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Test series didn't go to plan \u2014 but when it comes to the white ball in the last 12 months, I've felt in good form. \u201cI was always confident heading into this series, and it's nice to put it right tonight.\u201d Jason Roy, Hales' opening partner had gone close to breaking Smith's record with 162 against Sri Lanka at The Oval \u2014 his home ground \u2014 in June. \u201cI knew I was I closing in,\u201d said Hales. \u201cWhen I heard the cheer going round the ground I knew something was happening, but at the time I was unaware,\u201d he added of the moment he broke Smith's longstanding record. \u201cIt's a special feeling.\u201d '444 is a bit too much'\nThis victory was further evidence of the progress England have made in 50-over cricket since their dismal first-round exit at last year's World Cup. And Hales believes there is better to come from the 2019 World Cup hosts. \u201cIt's exciting for us as I don't think we've reached our full potential yet. We're still learning with the bat and ball and still improving in the field so hopefully there's a lot more to come in the next two years,\u201d Hales said. A delighted Morgan added: \u201cTo score 171 in any form of the game \u2014 particularly a 50-over game \u2014 is remarkable. \u201cInternational cricket's about how you go through the tough times and how you manage them \u2014 certainly today he (Hales) has come back really well from them.\u201d Pakistan captain Azhar Ali praised Hales and Buttler but accepted his own side's fielding had been well below the required standard. \u201cIt was an exceptional innings from Alex Hales and Jos Buttler,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think 444 is a bit too much. \u201cI think we missed some key chances \u2014 especially that (Wahab Riaz) no-ball when we would have got rid of Alex Hales on about 70. \u201cWe didn't start well, and there's no excuse for that.

However, greater thinking was perhaps needed before the committee\u2019s composition and the process of consultation with stakeholders were finalised.Headed by foreign policy adviser Sartaj Aziz, the committee comprised Governor Jhagra (and governor Abbasi before him), Safron Minister (retired) Lt-Gen Abdul Qadir Baloch, Law Minister Zahid Hamid, National Security Adviser (retired) Lt-Gen Nasser Janjua, and Safron secretary Muhammad Shehzad Arbab. It might have been better if these government heavyweights had been joined by a couple of non-government representatives.The committee held consultations with the maliks and elders in the tribal agencies and frontier regions, \u201crepresentatives of all political parties and other members of the civil society, including traders, media representatives, and youth\u201d. Since the report does not identify the people the committee consulted it is not possible to determine their representative character. Parliamentarians from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or from any other region, or organisations such as lawyers\u2019 associations, were apparently not consulted.\nOne should like to see a wide-ranging discussion on what Fata will become under the \u2018rewaj\u2019 rule.\n\nThe report takes brief note of the Naseerullah Babar proposals of 1976 (which would have \u201csucceeded had the military coup of 1977 not occurred\u201d); extension of adult franchise to Fata in 1996 and of the Local Government Ordinance in 2002; the Sahibzada Imtiaz Ahmad report of 2006; the Fata sustainable development plan of 2006; retired justice Ajmal Mian\u2019s report of 2008; a report by the Shaheed Bhutto Foundation of 2008 and the Political Parties\u2019 Joint Commission of 2013; and the report of the governor\u2019s Fata reform commission of 2015. All these efforts sought to reform the FCR and that is the present committee\u2019s main concern too.The committee has proposed restricted integration of Fata with KP as the territory will be subject to a special law, to be called the tribal areas rewaj act, which will replace the FCR. \u201cProvisions relating to collective responsibility in the FCR should be omitted from the new act,\u201d says the report and adds that the \u201cjurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Peshawar High Court should be extended to Fata\u201d.The committee has recommended that \u201cthe \u2018jirga\u2019 system should be retained for both civil and criminal matters, whereby the judge [which judge?] will appoint a council of elders to decide factual issues in accordance with rewaj and will pass a decree in accordance with its findings on civil reference or pass an order in accordance with its findings and applicable law in a criminal reference\u201d. This crudely drafted formulation is unlikely to pass scrutiny by sticklers for due process.The buzzword for Fata now is rewaj. We recently heard this word when two men were acquitted of murder by a political agent because the jirga had held that the rewaj permitted homicide in the name of \u2018honour\u2019 or ghairat.One should like to see a wide-ranging discussion on what Fata will become under the rewaj rule. If the proposed rewaj act will legitimise the tribal customary law, how will the tribal people be integrated with the population of KP? The people in that province will be yoked under three different and often contradictory justice systems \u2014 the Pakistan laws, nizam-i-adl in Malakand Division and the rewaj in the tribal areas.Well-informed sources maintain that a United Nations agency has played a significant role in the drafting of the rewaj act. If this is true, the involvement of United Nations personnel would be difficult to justify for producing a law that offends against the principles of law and justice advocated by the international champion of non-discriminatory legal systems.The committee says that it \u201chas proposed retention of the jirga system in the civil and criminal justice system of Fata for the reason that its repeal would be resisted and destabilise the social order, which is undesirable\u201d. The committee hopes that the jirga \u201cwill develop into the jury system\u201d and also boldly proclaims that \u201cany legal instrument, which incorporates the rewaj as part of the judicial process, must ensure that it is not in conflict with fundamental rights as well as other substantive laws administered in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u201d.No amount of jugglery with words can hide the fact that the rewaj law will legitimise deviations from the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and will discriminate between the people of Fata and their compatriots within the province of KP and outside it.Strangely enough, the committee is worried only about resistance to the repeal of the jirga system. One wonders whether the committee took into consideration the resistance that the plan for land settlement could run into. As regards the extension of Pakistan laws to Fata, the committee might not have been unaware of the strange case of the extension of custom laws to Malakand Division and the government\u2019s hasty retreat there.Mainstreaming Fata has been on the agenda for decades. The reform committee is proposing the territory\u2019s integration (even though partially) with KP at a time when external factors may not be conducive to a substantive change in the life of the tribal people. It may not be prudent to ignore the possible reaction of Afghanistan to the process and its impact on the section of the population that has not concealed its opposition to merger with KP. Even the memorandum of Fata parliamentarians included in the report refers to two options \u2014 integration with KP or creation of a new province. As a senior lawyer from the Malakand division told the present writer, Fata\u2019s future cannot be decided without substantial revamping of the country\u2019s foreign and defence policies.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "I.A.

The US world number one appeared untroubled by the balky right shoulder that has hindered her in recent weeks, delivering a dozen aces and 27 winners overall in the 63-minute contest. \u201cI knew today I needed to be focused because I\u2019ve played her. She\u2019s gotten to the semi-finals. She goes deep in majors,\u201d Serena said of the Russian left-hander who beat her in the fourth round of the 2012 Australian Open. Serena is chasing a record seventh title on the hardcourts of Flushing Meadows where she first triumphed in 1999. A victory would see her break the Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam titles she now shares with German Steffi Graf and close in on Margaret Court\u2019s all-time mark of 24 major titles. While Serena has struggled since Wimbledon, Murray went from claiming a second title at the All England club to a successful defence of his Olympic gold in Rio. Vying to become the fourth man in the Open Era to reach all four major finals in a calendar year, Murray, too, produced a dominant service performance in a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Czech Lukas Rosol. \u201cI don\u2019t think I had any break points against me, which is very good,\u201d the Scot said.

The 36-year-old Venus, enjoying a resurgence in a 2016 season that includes a WTA title in Taiwan, survived 63 unforced errors against the rising 22-year-old, although she was pleased that her aggressive approach also yielded 46 winners. \u201cThe good part is I\u2019m playing the game I want to play, I\u2019m playing aggressively and moving forward,\u201d Venus said. BOUCHARD OUT Fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland, trying to make it to the quarter-finals in New York for the first time, breezed past US qualifier Jessica Pegula 6-1, 6-1 and fifth-seeded Romanian Simona Halep also eased through with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over Belgian Kirsten Flipkens. But Eugenie Bouchard, the 2014 Wimbledon runner-up, was tripped up 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 by 20-year-old Czech Katerina Siniakova in a match filled with 46 unforced errors by the Canadian. There were various upsets around the grounds during the afternoon, including 19-year-old American Jared Donaldson\u2019s 4-6, 7-5, 6-4, 6-0 elimination of 12th-seeded David Goffin, and a loss by No 29 Sam Querrey. Three seeded women departed, including former world number one and 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic. Men\u2019s third seed Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland, a two-time semi-finalist, reached the second round with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 6-4 win over Spain\u2019s Fernando Verdasco. Kei Nishikori, who became Asia\u2019s first men\u2019s Grand Slam finalist in New York in 2014, when he fell to Marin Cilic in the final, also advanced, downing German Benjamin Becker 6-1, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Eighth-seeded Dominic Thiem of Austria needed five sets to secure his second-round spot, downing Australia\u2019s John Millman 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3. Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 US Open champion whose career was nearly ended by three wrist surgeries, advanced with a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) victory over fellow Argentine Diego Schwartzman. There was a little record-setting on the men\u2019s side as well, with Croatian Ivo Karlovic belting a US Open record of 61 aces in a 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/5), 7-5 win over Taiwan\u2019s Lu Yen-Hsun. Karlovic, 37, beat the previous best of 49 aces for one match in New York established by Richard Krajicek in 1999. \u201cI knew there were a lot of aces because there was a period when almost every serve was an ace,\u201d Karlovic said.

The government has been relying heavily on banking money to meet liquidity requirements. The practice continues but not with zest as the emphasis has shifted to borrowing from the State Bank of Pakistan.The government can probably borrow more liberally from the central bank now after completion of agreement with the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF used to be critical of borrowing from the central bank.The government has actually been retiring the banking debts. Since the maturity of Pakistan Investment Bonds (PIBs) was about Rs1.2 trillion during June and July, the repayments required more borrowing.However, the banks have shown no change in their investment strategy and despite sharp fall in the returns of both T-bills and PIBs, they show willingness to park maximum liquidity in the government papers.In this auction, the banks offered Rs309bn to invest.

He has climbed K2 and summited Everest five times and on August 4, the 30-year-old also summited Gasherbrum-I in Pakistan. His eight-person expedition was the only one to summit GI so far this year, and half the team also summited Gasherbrum-II. Mr Gyalje Sherpa intends to return to Pakistan to summit Broad Peak in 2017, and climb GII and Nanga Parbat in 2018.Q: How is the job of a Nepali Sherpa different from high altitude Pakistani porters?A: Unlike Pakistani high altitude porters, Nepali Sherpas do the difficult job of determining and then establishing the route, and then going up first to fix ropes. This is time consuming and difficult. All the expedition members have to do is follow the route and climb, hanging on to the ropes Sherpas have already fixed.Q: Why do both veteran and amateur mountaineers prefer to hire the services of Nepali Sherpas over Pakistani climbers?A: Mountaineering is a highly specialized and technical sport in Nepal. There are 43 internationally certified Nepali Sherpas while there are none in Pakistan. The non-certified Nepali Sherpas are also highly trained. Climbers in Pakistan can no doubt reach to the top, but they lack the basic mountaineering knowledge and training. This year I needed seven professional climbers from Pakistan to assist my expedition, I found only two and even they had to be taught how to tie knots while fixing ropes. Climbing is a dangerous sport. Foreign expeditions cannot put their trust in someone who lacks basic mountaineering knowledge and training.Q: How can Pakistani high altitude climbers become as good as Nepali Sherpas?A: Tibet faced the same problem. Then local Tibetans started climbing with Nepali Sherpas and were trained. A decade later, Tibetans could call themselves professional climbers and foreign expeditions could trust Tibetan climbers as much as they did Nepali Sherpas. Maybe a similar solution can be worked out here and in five to six years Pakistani climbers can become professionals. It makes sense to hire a Pakistani climber for $4,000 to $5,000 than hire a Nepali Sherpa for $12, 000. Given proper training, Pakistani climbers can easily replace Nepali Sherpas in Pakistan.Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Jamal Shahid", "title": "LIVING COLOURS: \u2018Mountaineering is a highly specialised, technical sport in Nepal\u2019"}}

Hales's innings at his home ground of Trent Bridge was the highest score by any England batsman in this format and helped the hosts to a 169-run win that ensured they won the series at 3-0 up with two to play. But Hales believes it's just a matter of time before an England colleague betters his score. \u201cI think the improvements we've shown in the last couple of years, I'm not sure how long that record will stand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe batting we've got all the way down to pretty much number 11 so it's an exciting time for us as a team.\u201d Jos Buttler made a dashing 90 not out, that included England's fastest ODI 50 \u2014 off just 22 balls.Partnerships of 248 between Hales and Joe Root (85) and an unbroken 161 shared by Buttler and England captain Eoin Morgan (57 not out) overwhelmed Pakistan's bowlers in a total featuring 16 sixes. Read: This is why the Pakistani ODI team is ranked No. 9This was a timely innings for Hales, who had managed just 145 runs at an average of 18.12 during England's preceding 2-2 Test series with Pakistan. That was followed by meagre scores of seven and 14 in the first two ODIs at Southampton and Lord's respectively. But back in front of his Nottinghamshire home crowd, the opener looked a far more confident and authoritative batsman as Robin Smith's 167 not out against Australia at Edgbaston back in 1993 finally ceased to be England's highest individual ODI score. \u201cIt's been a tough few weeks personally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Test series didn't go to plan \u2014 but when it comes to the white ball in the last 12 months, I've felt in good form. \u201cI was always confident heading into this series, and it's nice to put it right tonight.\u201d Jason Roy, Hales' opening partner had gone close to breaking Smith's record with 162 against Sri Lanka at The Oval \u2014 his home ground \u2014 in June. \u201cI knew I was I closing in,\u201d said Hales. \u201cWhen I heard the cheer going round the ground I knew something was happening, but at the time I was unaware,\u201d he added of the moment he broke Smith's longstanding record. \u201cIt's a special feeling.\u201d '444 is a bit too much'\nThis victory was further evidence of the progress England have made in 50-over cricket since their dismal first-round exit at last year's World Cup. And Hales believes there is better to come from the 2019 World Cup hosts. \u201cIt's exciting for us as I don't think we've reached our full potential yet. We're still learning with the bat and ball and still improving in the field so hopefully there's a lot more to come in the next two years,\u201d Hales said.

For example, there is no systematic route from Mingora to Saidu. Those wishing to go to Saidu have to travel further beyond their destination before making their way back, for lack of a proper stopping point at Saidu. Traffic policemen compound the issue by preventing commuters from stopping at their intended destination. The provincial government needs to build interval stops, just like bus stops in metropolitan areas, for pickups and rickshaws to be able to stop and drop passengers whose intended destination is Saidu, instead of forcing them to be inconvenienced. This will doubly benefit commuters as proper stopping points will reduce the frequency of illegally parked vehicles that currently pose a safety problem on the road.

World number one Serena started her bid for a record-breaking 23rd major title opened her account with a tidy 6-3, 6-3 win over 29th-ranked Ekaterina Makarova, to join her sister Venus in the second round of the year\u2019s final Grand Slam. The US world number one appeared untroubled by the balky right shoulder that has hindered her in recent weeks, delivering a dozen aces and 27 winners overall in the 63-minute contest. \u201cI knew today I needed to be focused because I\u2019ve played her. She\u2019s gotten to the semi-finals. She goes deep in majors,\u201d Serena said of the Russian left-hander who beat her in the fourth round of the 2012 Australian Open. Serena is chasing a record seventh title on the hardcourts of Flushing Meadows where she first triumphed in 1999. A victory would see her break the Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam titles she now shares with German Steffi Graf and close in on Margaret Court\u2019s all-time mark of 24 major titles. While Serena has struggled since Wimbledon, Murray went from claiming a second title at the All England club to a successful defence of his Olympic gold in Rio. Vying to become the fourth man in the Open Era to reach all four major finals in a calendar year, Murray, too, produced a dominant service performance in a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Czech Lukas Rosol. \u201cI don\u2019t think I had any break points against me, which is very good,\u201d the Scot said. Before the floodlights came up, Serena\u2019s elder sister Venus claimed a Grand Slam record of her own as her 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 victory over Ukraine\u2019s Kateryna Kozlova marked her 72nd appearance in the main draw of a major. The 36-year-old Venus, enjoying a resurgence in a 2016 season that includes a WTA title in Taiwan, survived 63 unforced errors against the rising 22-year-old, although she was pleased that her aggressive approach also yielded 46 winners. \u201cThe good part is I\u2019m playing the game I want to play, I\u2019m playing aggressively and moving forward,\u201d Venus said. BOUCHARD OUT Fourth seed Agnieszka Radwanska of Poland, trying to make it to the quarter-finals in New York for the first time, breezed past US qualifier Jessica Pegula 6-1, 6-1 and fifth-seeded Romanian Simona Halep also eased through with a 6-0, 6-2 victory over Belgian Kirsten Flipkens. But Eugenie Bouchard, the 2014 Wimbledon runner-up, was tripped up 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 by 20-year-old Czech Katerina Siniakova in a match filled with 46 unforced errors by the Canadian. There were various upsets around the grounds during the afternoon, including 19-year-old American Jared Donaldson\u2019s 4-6, 7-5, 6-4, 6-0 elimination of 12th-seeded David Goffin, and a loss by No 29 Sam Querrey. Three seeded women departed, including former world number one and 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic. Men\u2019s third seed Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland, a two-time semi-finalist, reached the second round with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 6-4 win over Spain\u2019s Fernando Verdasco. Kei Nishikori, who became Asia\u2019s first men\u2019s Grand Slam finalist in New York in 2014, when he fell to Marin Cilic in the final, also advanced, downing German Benjamin Becker 6-1, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Eighth-seeded Dominic Thiem of Austria needed five sets to secure his second-round spot, downing Australia\u2019s John Millman 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3. Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 US Open champion whose career was nearly ended by three wrist surgeries, advanced with a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) victory over fellow Argentine Diego Schwartzman. There was a little record-setting on the men\u2019s side as well, with Croatian Ivo Karlovic belting a US Open record of 61 aces in a 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/5), 7-5 win over Taiwan\u2019s Lu Yen-Hsun. Karlovic, 37, beat the previous best of 49 aces for one match in New York established by Richard Krajicek in 1999. \u201cI knew there were a lot of aces because there was a period when almost every serve was an ace,\u201d Karlovic said.

{"1281149": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "NOTTINGHAM: Alex Hales does not expect to be an England record-holder for long after his 171 helped the team post a new world One-Day International (ODI) mark of 444 for three en route to thrashing Pakistan on Tuesday. Hales's innings at his home ground of Trent Bridge was the highest score by any England batsman in this format and helped the hosts to a 169-run win that ensured they won the series at 3-0 up with two to play. But Hales believes it's just a matter of time before an England colleague betters his score. \u201cI think the improvements we've shown in the last couple of years, I'm not sure how long that record will stand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe batting we've got all the way down to pretty much number 11 so it's an exciting time for us as a team.\u201d Jos Buttler made a dashing 90 not out, that included England's fastest ODI 50 \u2014 off just 22 balls.Partnerships of 248 between Hales and Joe Root (85) and an unbroken 161 shared by Buttler and England captain Eoin Morgan (57 not out) overwhelmed Pakistan's bowlers in a total featuring 16 sixes. Read: This is why the Pakistani ODI team is ranked No. 9This was a timely innings for Hales, who had managed just 145 runs at an average of 18.12 during England's preceding 2-2 Test series with Pakistan. That was followed by meagre scores of seven and 14 in the first two ODIs at Southampton and Lord's respectively. But back in front of his Nottinghamshire home crowd, the opener looked a far more confident and authoritative batsman as Robin Smith's 167 not out against Australia at Edgbaston back in 1993 finally ceased to be England's highest individual ODI score. \u201cIt's been a tough few weeks personally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Test series didn't go to plan \u2014 but when it comes to the white ball in the last 12 months, I've felt in good form. \u201cI was always confident heading into this series, and it's nice to put it right tonight.\u201d Jason Roy, Hales' opening partner had gone close to breaking Smith's record with 162 against Sri Lanka at The Oval \u2014 his home ground \u2014 in June. \u201cI knew I was I closing in,\u201d said Hales. \u201cWhen I heard the cheer going round the ground I knew something was happening, but at the time I was unaware,\u201d he added of the moment he broke Smith's longstanding record. \u201cIt's a special feeling.\u201d '444 is a bit too much'\nThis victory was further evidence of the progress England have made in 50-over cricket since their dismal first-round exit at last year's World Cup. And Hales believes there is better to come from the 2019 World Cup hosts. \u201cIt's exciting for us as I don't think we've reached our full potential yet. We're still learning with the bat and ball and still improving in the field so hopefully there's a lot more to come in the next two years,\u201d Hales said. A delighted Morgan added: \u201cTo score 171 in any form of the game \u2014 particularly a 50-over game \u2014 is remarkable. \u201cInternational cricket's about how you go through the tough times and how you manage them \u2014 certainly today he (Hales) has come back really well from them.\u201d Pakistan captain Azhar Ali praised Hales and Buttler but accepted his own side's fielding had been well below the required standard. \u201cIt was an exceptional innings from Alex Hales and Jos Buttler,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think 444 is a bit too much. \u201cI think we missed some key chances \u2014 especially that (Wahab Riaz) no-ball when we would have got rid of Alex Hales on about 70. \u201cWe didn't start well, and there's no excuse for that.

The committee hopes that the jirga \u201cwill develop into the jury system\u201d and also boldly proclaims that \u201cany legal instrument, which incorporates the rewaj as part of the judicial process, must ensure that it is not in conflict with fundamental rights as well as other substantive laws administered in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u201d.No amount of jugglery with words can hide the fact that the rewaj law will legitimise deviations from the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and will discriminate between the people of Fata and their compatriots within the province of KP and outside it.Strangely enough, the committee is worried only about resistance to the repeal of the jirga system.

The registrar\u2019s note contained details of the Quetta bombing, which left 73 people dead, while 104 people were seriously wounded in an attack that is said to have eliminated an entire generation of the province\u2019s legal fraternity Earlier on Aug 13, the Pakistan Bar Council (PBC) had, through a resolution, requested the chief justice to take suo motu notice of the Quetta tragedy and take those responsible to task.\nLegal community had been pressing for judicial intervention in the matter\n\nOn Aug 22, a demonstration was held outside the Parliament House in Islamabad on the PBC\u2019s call, where lawyers demanded the immediate arrest of those behind the attack and early provision of monetary support to the families of those slain and injured. They had also called on the chief justice to take suo motu action in the matter.Former chief justice Iftikhar Mohammad Chaudhry had also written to CJP Jamali on Aug 25, asking him to take cognizance of the horrific Quetta attack. The letter emphasised that the Supreme Court must ensure the rights of the people of Balochistan, especially their right to life as guaranteed under Article 9 of the Constitution.However, the registrar\u2019s note did not mention either the letter or the PBC demand, but stated that the incident had raised doubts about the state of governance in Balochistan, and indeed the whole country.But the tone and tenor of the registrar\u2019s note is quite similar to Justice Chaudhry\u2019s letter.\u201cThe way the planned incident took place brings into question the efficacy of the state machinery. Lack of security arrangements, despite past precedents, points at the miserable failure of the provincial government and law \nenforcement agencies to avert the tragic incident,\u201d the registrar regretted.He went on to say that the lack of proper security arrangements by the administration constituted a violation of the fundamental right to life and liberty, guaranteed under Article 9 of the Constitution.Moreover, insufficient arrangements and medical facilities in the hospital of the provincial headquarters resulted in further loss of life as the seriously injured were compelled to shift from the Civil Hospital to the Combined Military Hospital and other hospitals outside the province, the note said.The post-disaster scenario is also not encouraging either, the registrar observed, saying it appeared the incident had been forgotten and no headway had been made; either in tracing the culprits or mobilising state resources to prevent such tragedies in future. The note also said that there was no evidence that the provincial government had taken any cognisance of the matter.After going through the note, CJP Jamali ordered the court office to fix the matter before the court on Sept 20, issuing notices to the Balochistan chief secretary, advocate general and IGP.Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Nasir Iqbal", "title": "SC takes suo motu notice of Quetta carnage"}}

Many people have already purchased their sacrificial animals, while those who haven\u2019t aren\u2019t going to leave it too late. The animals just have to be bought and cared for well in advance or there is no fun.No child, or adult for that matter, in Pakistan can claim that they haven\u2019t petted, pampered or cared for a sacrificial animal. After all, this is part of the spirit behind remembering the sacrifice of Prophet Ibrahim on Eidul Azha.But this time things are a bit different and dangerous too. Though we don\u2019t want to scare you all, but you need to be careful about the contact you make with the sacrificial animals and the health status of the animal as the Congo virus is here. You must have heard about cases of this disease in people and almost two dozen people have died from it this year alone in Pakistan.There is an estimated 10\u201330 per cent fatality rate in humans and so far no vaccine is available for human use. In such a scenario, the only way to prevent people from catching this is through raising awareness and adopting precautionary measures. Let us learn more about this disease so that we can stay safe and healthy during Eidul Azha when there is a greater risk of the spread of this disease.What is Congo virus?Crimean Congo Hemorrhagic Fever, or Congo virus, is viral infection transmitted by Hyalomma ticks to both animals and humans. The virus is transmitted by ticks living in the skins of goats, cows, buffalos and camels, feeding on their blood. The disease is rare in infected animals, who mostly act as carriers of the disease which they transmit, it is severe in infected humans.It is prevalent in Asia, Africa, Middle East and South-Eastern Europe. Though cases have been reported throughout the year, the disease is more common between March to October. So right now the ticks are very active and can easily spread to other animals, places where livestock are kept and humans too.InfestationPeople can get Congo virus by:\u2022 Being bitten directly by the tick.\u2022 Humans and animals can transmit the virus to other humans.\u2022 Through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.\u2022 Human-to-human transmission can occur by close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.\u2022 Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilisation of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.SymptomsAfter an incubation period of one to three days following a tick bite or five to six days after exposure to infected blood or tissues, flu-like symptoms appear, which may resolve after one week. But in many cases, signs of haemorrhage appear within three to five days of the onset of the first symptoms.Symptoms include high fever, vomiting, diarrheal, red eyes, bleeding and severe body pain, especially in the joints, abdominal pain and sore throat, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. As the condition gets severe, bleeding from gums, skin and large intestine may also occur and red spots appear on the body. The bleeding is due to the shortage of white cells that this disease causes and this can be very dangerous. Anyone who shows these symptoms needs to be immediately taken to the hospital as early diagnosis is important in saving the patient\u2019s life. Recovery starts after the tenth day or so. Precautions\u2022 To avoid tick bites, people who go near animals or the cattle market should cover their face, hands, feet and so on. They should wear light coloured clothes so that a tick can be easily seen if it sticks on their clothes.\u2022 Long pants tucked into boots and long-sleeved shirts should be worn.\u2022 Avoid touching or going too close to animals that may have ticks or those that have been bought from markets where they have been in contact with many other animals from all over the country.\u2022 Contact with infected blood or tissues should also be avoided. Protective clothing and gloves should be used when handling infected animals, particularly when blood and tissues are handled. \u2022 Unpasteurised milk should not be drunk. In meat, the virus is usually deactivated by post-slaughter acidification. It is also killed by cooking.\u2022 Use tick repellents.\u2022 Acaricides, which are pesticides that kill ticks and mites, can be used on livestock and other domesticated animals to control ticks, particularly where they are kept and before slaughter.\u2022 The waste material of sacrificial animals should be disposed properly.The safest way to avoid Congo virus is to control your enthusiasm this year and don\u2019t pet and play as freely with them as you have been doing previously. I know it is hard, but in the case of Congo virus, prevention is better than cure.

The virus is transmitted by ticks living in the skins of goats, cows, buffalos and camels, feeding on their blood. The disease is rare in infected animals, who mostly act as carriers of the disease which they transmit, it is severe in infected humans.It is prevalent in Asia, Africa, Middle East and South-Eastern Europe. Though cases have been reported throughout the year, the disease is more common between March to October. So right now the ticks are very active and can easily spread to other animals, places where livestock are kept and humans too.InfestationPeople can get Congo virus by:\u2022 Being bitten directly by the tick.\u2022 Humans and animals can transmit the virus to other humans.\u2022 Through contact with infected animal blood or tissues during and immediately after slaughter.\u2022 Human-to-human transmission can occur by close contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other bodily fluids of infected persons.\u2022 Hospital-acquired infections can also occur due to improper sterilisation of medical equipment, reuse of needles and contamination of medical supplies.SymptomsAfter an incubation period of one to three days following a tick bite or five to six days after exposure to infected blood or tissues, flu-like symptoms appear, which may resolve after one week. But in many cases, signs of haemorrhage appear within three to five days of the onset of the first symptoms.Symptoms include high fever, vomiting, diarrheal, red eyes, bleeding and severe body pain, especially in the joints, abdominal pain and sore throat, followed by sharp mood swings and confusion. As the condition gets severe, bleeding from gums, skin and large intestine may also occur and red spots appear on the body. The bleeding is due to the shortage of white cells that this disease causes and this can be very dangerous. Anyone who shows these symptoms needs to be immediately taken to the hospital as early diagnosis is important in saving the patient\u2019s life. Recovery starts after the tenth day or so. Precautions\u2022 To avoid tick bites, people who go near animals or the cattle market should cover their face, hands, feet and so on. They should wear light coloured clothes so that a tick can be easily seen if it sticks on their clothes.\u2022 Long pants tucked into boots and long-sleeved shirts should be worn.\u2022 Avoid touching or going too close to animals that may have ticks or those that have been bought from markets where they have been in contact with many other animals from all over the country.\u2022 Contact with infected blood or tissues should also be avoided. Protective clothing and gloves should be used when handling infected animals, particularly when blood and tissues are handled. \u2022 Unpasteurised milk should not be drunk. In meat, the virus is usually deactivated by post-slaughter acidification. It is also killed by cooking.\u2022 Use tick repellents.\u2022 Acaricides, which are pesticides that kill ticks and mites, can be used on livestock and other domesticated animals to control ticks, particularly where they are kept and before slaughter.\u2022 The waste material of sacrificial animals should be disposed properly.The safest way to avoid Congo virus is to control your enthusiasm this year and don\u2019t pet and play as freely with them as you have been doing previously. I know it is hard, but in the case of Congo virus, prevention is better than cure.

{"1281149": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "NOTTINGHAM: Alex Hales does not expect to be an England record-holder for long after his 171 helped the team post a new world One-Day International (ODI) mark of 444 for three en route to thrashing Pakistan on Tuesday. Hales's innings at his home ground of Trent Bridge was the highest score by any England batsman in this format and helped the hosts to a 169-run win that ensured they won the series at 3-0 up with two to play. But Hales believes it's just a matter of time before an England colleague betters his score. \u201cI think the improvements we've shown in the last couple of years, I'm not sure how long that record will stand,\u201d he said. \u201cThe batting we've got all the way down to pretty much number 11 so it's an exciting time for us as a team.\u201d Jos Buttler made a dashing 90 not out, that included England's fastest ODI 50 \u2014 off just 22 balls.Partnerships of 248 between Hales and Joe Root (85) and an unbroken 161 shared by Buttler and England captain Eoin Morgan (57 not out) overwhelmed Pakistan's bowlers in a total featuring 16 sixes. Read: This is why the Pakistani ODI team is ranked No. 9This was a timely innings for Hales, who had managed just 145 runs at an average of 18.12 during England's preceding 2-2 Test series with Pakistan. That was followed by meagre scores of seven and 14 in the first two ODIs at Southampton and Lord's respectively. But back in front of his Nottinghamshire home crowd, the opener looked a far more confident and authoritative batsman as Robin Smith's 167 not out against Australia at Edgbaston back in 1993 finally ceased to be England's highest individual ODI score. \u201cIt's been a tough few weeks personally,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Test series didn't go to plan \u2014 but when it comes to the white ball in the last 12 months, I've felt in good form. \u201cI was always confident heading into this series, and it's nice to put it right tonight.\u201d Jason Roy, Hales' opening partner had gone close to breaking Smith's record with 162 against Sri Lanka at The Oval \u2014 his home ground \u2014 in June. \u201cI knew I was I closing in,\u201d said Hales. \u201cWhen I heard the cheer going round the ground I knew something was happening, but at the time I was unaware,\u201d he added of the moment he broke Smith's longstanding record. \u201cIt's a special feeling.\u201d '444 is a bit too much'\nThis victory was further evidence of the progress England have made in 50-over cricket since their dismal first-round exit at last year's World Cup. And Hales believes there is better to come from the 2019 World Cup hosts. \u201cIt's exciting for us as I don't think we've reached our full potential yet. We're still learning with the bat and ball and still improving in the field so hopefully there's a lot more to come in the next two years,\u201d Hales said. A delighted Morgan added: \u201cTo score 171 in any form of the game \u2014 particularly a 50-over game \u2014 is remarkable. \u201cInternational cricket's about how you go through the tough times and how you manage them \u2014 certainly today he (Hales) has come back really well from them.\u201d Pakistan captain Azhar Ali praised Hales and Buttler but accepted his own side's fielding had been well below the required standard. \u201cIt was an exceptional innings from Alex Hales and Jos Buttler,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I think 444 is a bit too much. \u201cI think we missed some key chances \u2014 especially that (Wahab Riaz) no-ball when we would have got rid of Alex Hales on about 70. \u201cWe didn't start well, and there's no excuse for that. Those fielding lapses straightaway didn't send a good message.\u201d\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Hales backs England to keep on breaking records"}}

For example, there is no systematic route from Mingora to Saidu. Those wishing to go to Saidu have to travel further beyond their destination before making their way back, for lack of a proper stopping point at Saidu. Traffic policemen compound the issue by preventing commuters from stopping at their intended destination. The provincial government needs to build interval stops, just like bus stops in metropolitan areas, for pickups and rickshaws to be able to stop and drop passengers whose intended destination is Saidu, instead of forcing them to be inconvenienced. This will doubly benefit commuters as proper stopping points will reduce the frequency of illegally parked vehicles that currently pose a safety problem on the road.

{"1281249": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\nOf the 14 highest mountains in the world, Mingma Gyalje Sherpa from Nepal has climbed eight peaks that stand over 8,000 metres tall. He has climbed K2 and summited Everest five times and on August 4, the 30-year-old also summited Gasherbrum-I in Pakistan. His eight-person expedition was the only one to summit GI so far this year, and half the team also summited Gasherbrum-II. Mr Gyalje Sherpa intends to return to Pakistan to summit Broad Peak in 2017, and climb GII and Nanga Parbat in 2018.Q: How is the job of a Nepali Sherpa different from high altitude Pakistani porters?A: Unlike Pakistani high altitude porters, Nepali Sherpas do the difficult job of determining and then establishing the route, and then going up first to fix ropes. This is time consuming and difficult. All the expedition members have to do is follow the route and climb, hanging on to the ropes Sherpas have already fixed.Q: Why do both veteran and amateur mountaineers prefer to hire the services of Nepali Sherpas over Pakistani climbers?A: Mountaineering is a highly specialized and technical sport in Nepal. There are 43 internationally certified Nepali Sherpas while there are none in Pakistan. The non-certified Nepali Sherpas are also highly trained. Climbers in Pakistan can no doubt reach to the top, but they lack the basic mountaineering knowledge and training. This year I needed seven professional climbers from Pakistan to assist my expedition, I found only two and even they had to be taught how to tie knots while fixing ropes. Climbing is a dangerous sport. Foreign expeditions cannot put their trust in someone who lacks basic mountaineering knowledge and training.Q: How can Pakistani high altitude climbers become as good as Nepali Sherpas?A: Tibet faced the same problem. Then local Tibetans started climbing with Nepali Sherpas and were trained. A decade later, Tibetans could call themselves professional climbers and foreign expeditions could trust Tibetan climbers as much as they did Nepali Sherpas. Maybe a similar solution can be worked out here and in five to six years Pakistani climbers can become professionals. It makes sense to hire a Pakistani climber for $4,000 to $5,000 than hire a Nepali Sherpa for $12, 000. Given proper training, Pakistani climbers can easily replace Nepali Sherpas in Pakistan.Published{"1281139": {"date": "Updated August 31, 2016", "article": "NEW DELHI: US Secretary of State John Kerry said Pakistan had made progress in the fight against extremism in recent months, but urged Islamabad to push harder against militants hiding within its borders as tensions with neighbouring India rise amid more violence in the disputed region of Kashmir.\u201cIt is clear that Pakistan has work to do in order to push harder against its indigenous groups that are engaged in extremist activities,\u201d Kerry said on Wednesday, the second day of a visit to India.Kerry said the United States had made it clear to Islamabad that it needs to act against groups such as the Taliban-linked Haqqani network and Lashkar-e-Taiba that are suspected of operating from Pakistan to launch attacks against its neighbours India and Afghanistan.\u201cIn fairness, the Pakistanis have suffered greatly from terrorism in their own country,\u201d Kerry said. \u201cAll of us need to be supportive and also understanding of how difficult it is to take it on step by step.\u201d Without elaborating, he added: \u201cI believe that in the last months progress is being made and the Pakistanis are moving at a greater pace.\u201d The United States accuses Pakistan of not doing enough against the Haqqani militants.

Serena is chasing a record seventh title on the hardcourts of Flushing Meadows where she first triumphed in 1999. A victory would see her break the Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam titles she now shares with German Steffi Graf and close in on Margaret Court\u2019s all-time mark of 24 major titles. While Serena has struggled since Wimbledon, Murray went from claiming a second title at the All England club to a successful defence of his Olympic gold in Rio.

{"1281159": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\nTHE report of the Committee on Fata Reforms, that has rightly been made public via the website of the Ministry of States and Frontier Regions (Safron), needs to be studied with great care because bold strokes of policy sometimes run dangerously close to rashness.The committee was set up in November 2015 and the completion of its report within 10 months is quite creditable. However, greater thinking was perhaps needed before the committee\u2019s composition and the process of consultation with stakeholders were finalised.Headed by foreign policy adviser Sartaj Aziz, the committee comprised Governor Jhagra (and governor Abbasi before him), Safron Minister (retired) Lt-Gen Abdul Qadir Baloch, Law Minister Zahid Hamid, National Security Adviser (retired) Lt-Gen Nasser Janjua, and Safron secretary Muhammad Shehzad Arbab. It might have been better if these government heavyweights had been joined by a couple of non-government representatives.The committee held consultations with the maliks and elders in the tribal agencies and frontier regions, \u201crepresentatives of all political parties and other members of the civil society, including traders, media representatives, and youth\u201d. Since the report does not identify the people the committee consulted it is not possible to determine their representative character. Parliamentarians from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa or from any other region, or organisations such as lawyers\u2019 associations, were apparently not consulted.\nOne should like to see a wide-ranging discussion on what Fata will become under the \u2018rewaj\u2019 rule.\n\nThe report takes brief note of the Naseerullah Babar proposals of 1976 (which would have \u201csucceeded had the military coup of 1977 not occurred\u201d); extension of adult franchise to Fata in 1996 and of the Local Government Ordinance in 2002; the Sahibzada Imtiaz Ahmad report of 2006; the Fata sustainable development plan of 2006; retired justice Ajmal Mian\u2019s report of 2008; a report by the Shaheed Bhutto Foundation of 2008 and the Political Parties\u2019 Joint Commission of 2013; and the report of the governor\u2019s Fata reform commission of 2015. All these efforts sought to reform the FCR and that is the present committee\u2019s main concern too.The committee has proposed restricted integration of Fata with KP as the territory will be subject to a special law, to be called the tribal areas rewaj act, which will replace the FCR. \u201cProvisions relating to collective responsibility in the FCR should be omitted from the new act,\u201d says the report and adds that the \u201cjurisdiction of the Supreme Court of Pakistan and the Peshawar High Court should be extended to Fata\u201d.The committee has recommended that \u201cthe \u2018jirga\u2019 system should be retained for both civil and criminal matters, whereby the judge [which judge?] will appoint a council of elders to decide factual issues in accordance with rewaj and will pass a decree in accordance with its findings on civil reference or pass an order in accordance with its findings and applicable law in a criminal reference\u201d. This crudely drafted formulation is unlikely to pass scrutiny by sticklers for due process.The buzzword for Fata now is rewaj. We recently heard this word when two men were acquitted of murder by a political agent because the jirga had held that the rewaj permitted homicide in the name of \u2018honour\u2019 or ghairat.One should like to see a wide-ranging discussion on what Fata will become under the rewaj rule. If the proposed rewaj act will legitimise the tribal customary law, how will the tribal people be integrated with the population of KP? The people in that province will be yoked under three different and often contradictory justice systems \u2014 the Pakistan laws, nizam-i-adl in Malakand Division and the rewaj in the tribal areas.Well-informed sources maintain that a United Nations agency has played a significant role in the drafting of the rewaj act. If this is true, the involvement of United Nations personnel would be difficult to justify for producing a law that offends against the principles of law and justice advocated by the international champion of non-discriminatory legal systems.The committee says that it \u201chas proposed retention of the jirga system in the civil and criminal justice system of Fata for the reason that its repeal would be resisted and destabilise the social order, which is undesirable\u201d. The committee hopes that the jirga \u201cwill develop into the jury system\u201d and also boldly proclaims that \u201cany legal instrument, which incorporates the rewaj as part of the judicial process, must ensure that it is not in conflict with fundamental rights as well as other substantive laws administered in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa\u201d.No amount of jugglery with words can hide the fact that the rewaj law will legitimise deviations from the fundamental rights enshrined in the Constitution of Pakistan and will discriminate between the people of Fata and their compatriots within the province of KP and outside it.Strangely enough, the committee is worried only about resistance to the repeal of the jirga system. One wonders whether the committee took into consideration the resistance that the plan for land settlement could run into. As regards the extension of Pakistan laws to Fata, the committee might not have been unaware of the strange case of the extension of custom laws to Malakand Division and the government\u2019s hasty retreat there.Mainstreaming Fata has been on the agenda for decades. The reform committee is proposing the territory\u2019s integration (even though partially) with KP at a time when external factors may not be conducive to a substantive change in the life of the tribal people. It may not be prudent to ignore the possible reaction of Afghanistan to the process and its impact on the section of the population that has not concealed its opposition to merger with KP. Even the memorandum of Fata parliamentarians included in the report refers to two options \u2014 integration with KP or creation of a new province. As a senior lawyer from the Malakand division told the present writer, Fata\u2019s future cannot be decided without substantial revamping of the country\u2019s foreign and defence policies.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "I.A.

For example, there is no systematic route from Mingora to Saidu. Those wishing to go to Saidu have to travel further beyond their destination before making their way back, for lack of a proper stopping point at Saidu. Traffic policemen compound the issue by preventing commuters from stopping at their intended destination. The provincial government needs to build interval stops, just like bus stops in metropolitan areas, for pickups and rickshaws to be able to stop and drop passengers whose intended destination is Saidu, instead of forcing them to be inconvenienced. This will doubly benefit commuters as proper stopping points will reduce the frequency of illegally parked vehicles that currently pose a safety problem on the road.

The US world number one appeared untroubled by the balky right shoulder that has hindered her in recent weeks, delivering a dozen aces and 27 winners overall in the 63-minute contest. \u201cI knew today I needed to be focused because I\u2019ve played her. She\u2019s gotten to the semi-finals. She goes deep in majors,\u201d Serena said of the Russian left-hander who beat her in the fourth round of the 2012 Australian Open. Serena is chasing a record seventh title on the hardcourts of Flushing Meadows where she first triumphed in 1999. A victory would see her break the Open Era record of 22 Grand Slam titles she now shares with German Steffi Graf and close in on Margaret Court\u2019s all-time mark of 24 major titles. While Serena has struggled since Wimbledon, Murray went from claiming a second title at the All England club to a successful defence of his Olympic gold in Rio. Vying to become the fourth man in the Open Era to reach all four major finals in a calendar year, Murray, too, produced a dominant service performance in a 6-3, 6-2, 6-2 victory over Czech Lukas Rosol. \u201cI don\u2019t think I had any break points against me, which is very good,\u201d the Scot said. Before the floodlights came up, Serena\u2019s elder sister Venus claimed a Grand Slam record of her own as her 6-2, 5-7, 6-4 victory over Ukraine\u2019s Kateryna Kozlova marked her 72nd appearance in the main draw of a major. The 36-year-old Venus, enjoying a resurgence in a 2016 season that includes a WTA title in Taiwan, survived 63 unforced errors against the rising 22-year-old, although she was pleased that her aggressive approach also yielded 46 winners. \u201cThe good part is I\u2019m playing the game I want to play, I\u2019m playing aggressively and moving forward,\u201d Venus said.

But Eugenie Bouchard, the 2014 Wimbledon runner-up, was tripped up 6-3, 3-6, 6-2 by 20-year-old Czech Katerina Siniakova in a match filled with 46 unforced errors by the Canadian. There were various upsets around the grounds during the afternoon, including 19-year-old American Jared Donaldson\u2019s 4-6, 7-5, 6-4, 6-0 elimination of 12th-seeded David Goffin, and a loss by No 29 Sam Querrey. Three seeded women departed, including former world number one and 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic. Men\u2019s third seed Stan Wawrinka of Switzerland, a two-time semi-finalist, reached the second round with a 7-6 (7-4), 6-4, 6-4 win over Spain\u2019s Fernando Verdasco. Kei Nishikori, who became Asia\u2019s first men\u2019s Grand Slam finalist in New York in 2014, when he fell to Marin Cilic in the final, also advanced, downing German Benjamin Becker 6-1, 6-1, 3-6, 6-3. Eighth-seeded Dominic Thiem of Austria needed five sets to secure his second-round spot, downing Australia\u2019s John Millman 6-3, 2-6, 5-7, 6-4, 6-3. Juan Martin del Potro, the 2009 US Open champion whose career was nearly ended by three wrist surgeries, advanced with a 6-4, 6-4, 7-6 (7-3) victory over fellow Argentine Diego Schwartzman. There was a little record-setting on the men\u2019s side as well, with Croatian Ivo Karlovic belting a US Open record of 61 aces in a 4-6, 7-6 (7-4), 6-7 (4/7), 7-6 (7/5), 7-5 win over Taiwan\u2019s Lu Yen-Hsun. Karlovic, 37, beat the previous best of 49 aces for one match in New York established by Richard Krajicek in 1999. \u201cI knew there were a lot of aces because there was a period when almost every serve was an ace,\u201d Karlovic said.
