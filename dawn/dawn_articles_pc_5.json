Mr Burney informed the audience that the World of Google publishing has users, advertisers and publishers and AdSense facilitates publishers earn money in a seamless manner. Anything between 100 and 50,000 dollars could be generated monthly, he added. An introduction to the two monetization products \u2014 Google AdSense and Google AdMob \u2014 followed. The audience was informed that AdSense had more than two million members and AdWords had one million plus members. Through AdSense you can make money, if you\u2019re a YouTube blogger, publisher etc. and only 20 per cent publishers are brought on board by Google as they are stringent about selecting the best, according to the experts. Basically AdSense connects advertisers to users so that users can make money. Leading media organizations like Dawn and Jang are working with Google in this domain. Placing of advertisements on various web content is how bloggers and publishers earn good money. The more traffic on your site, the more revenue you earn. One must first concentrate on generating traffic on their website and then think about monetizing it. Useful tips on making the most of AdSense were shared by Mr Burney. Some heart-warming case studies in form of videos were also shared with the audience to show the impact AdSense had on the lives of ordinary people by empowering them financially. Introducing Google tool, AdMob, Mr Ahmed highlighted what made a great app and what did users require in an app. The more user friendly and functional the app, the more popular it would be. The activity proved to be successful as 1,100 plus registrations were received for the session. Dr Shakeel Khoja of the Faculty of Computer Science, said the tech-talk was a promising initiative of its kind and he hoped that Google would hold such informative sessions for the Pakistani youth in the future as well.

The warning was issued by a two-judge SC bench headed by Justice Dost Mohammad Khan, after Law and Justice Commission Secretary Sarwar Khan \u2013 who has been appointed a focal person of an expert group constituted by the court \u2013 said none of the secretaries he twice invited to meetings turned up. The court had taken up a petition moved by Aasim Sajjad Akhtar, through his counsel Abid Hassan Minto, seeking a declaration that the state is bound by the Constitution to provide evicted katchi abadi residents shelter and other amenities. \nSenior officials\u2019 salaries to be attached if lethargy towards katchi abadi order persists\n\nThe petitioners also expressed concern over the manner in which residents of the I-11 katchi abadi were evicted by the Capital Development Authority (CDA), in an operation conducted on July 30 last year. In an order issued on April 20, the SC tasked the CDA and the federal and provincial governments with developing uniform legislation to devise inexpensive, low-cost housing for the destitute and shelterless. Subsequently, Sarwar Khan was appointed coordinator for facilitating and providing secretarial facilities to the working group, and governments were directed to ensure regular budgetary allocation for the smooth functioning of the group. The court ordered the law officers of all the provinces, and the respective finance directors, to attach the salaries of the officers assigned the task of developing the aforementioned uniform policy, in case any default was committed on their part. The court added that, in addition to their salaries being attached, the officers would also be proceeded against for contempt of court due to their lethargic attitude toward deciding a matter that has been pending for the last year. The court regretted that the CDA and the relevant federal and provincial departments were not interested in deciding the matter once and for all, through a proper policy. The court said this was unacceptable, and it would proceed against such a delinquent attitude of the relevant officers. However, it decided to issue a final warning, and directed the coordinator to convene yet another meeting of the relevant provincial secretaries and senior-most CDA officials \u2013 such as the member planning and housing and survey. It would be the responsibility of the coordinator to intimate, even in chambers, if any government official failed to take interest in the meeting of the expert group, the court said. The court ordered that in the next meeting, the expert group will finalise the fundamental features of the policy to provide low-cost housing facilities through legislation, to those who cannot afford modest housing. This should be done keeping in view areas\u2019 environment and soil condition. The policy should also guard the interest of the state by protecting it from land grabbers, the order said. The court has allowed two months for the formulation of this policy. If nothing is developed, the respective chief secretaries and CDA chairman will personally appear before the court on the next hearing date to explain the attitude towards court orders. The court also directed the CDA and government departments to conduct a comprehensive survey of katchi abadis with the assistance of Survey of Pakistan, Google Maps and other sources, and for which surveyors can also sign a memorandum of understanding with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to permanently register the family trees of those living in katchi abadis. This would also help authorities prevent undue dual benefits to the same family. The court also asked the federal and provincial governments to explain why budgetary allocations were not made for the expert group in their respective budgets. The court order will be sent to the principal secretary to the prime minister, the provincial chief secretaries, principal secretaries to all chief ministers, the CDA chairman, the Islamabad mayor, and the secretaries of Cabinet Division, Establishment Division and climate change. Meanwhile, the Aug 26, 2015 stay order restraining the capital administration from demolishing any house in existing katchi abadis will remain in place, the SC said.

In Jhelum, PTI candidate Fawad Chaudhry was outnumbered by PML-N\u2019s Matloob Mehdi with a margin of about 5,000 votes in the unofficial results of 309 of the 314 polling stations. The margin of win in the Vehari by-polls was narrow \u2014 1,056 votes. Polling started at 8pm and continued till 5pm in a largely peaceful way. Besides police, contingents of army and \nRangers were deployed in the two constituencies to prevent any untoward incident. However, independent candidate Mirza Mehboob Rabbani was allegedly tortured by PML-N activists over a trivial issue in Vehari, while Jhelum witnessed a post-polling clash resulting in bullet injuries to two activists of the PTI. Voter turnout remained quite low in Jhelum where at one polling station (Langar) not even a single vote was cast. The number of registered voters there was 1,384. Turnout was around 50 per cent in Vehari where PML-N\u2019s Yousuf Kasilia and PTI\u2019s Ayesha Nazir Jutt had a close contest. The number of registered voters in NA-63 Jhelum was 427,757 and in PP-232 Vehari 191,092. The Vehari seat had fallen vacant after an election tribunal unseated Mr Kasilia for submitting wrong statement of assets. During the 2013 general elections, he had won from the constituency as an independent candidate and later joined the PML-N. His supporters danced to the beat of drum soon after the announcement of unofficial results. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s daughter Maryam Nawaz celebrated the win through her Tweet, \u201cDekho, dekho kaun aaya (See, who has come)\u201d. Ayesha Jutt alleged that PML-N activists had forcibly stopped the polling process at some stations and that election results were manipulated, otherwise she was leading with a good margin. Also levelling allegations of pre-poll rigging, she vowed to use all options at her disposal for fighting against the \u201crigging\u201d. The Jhelum seat had fallen vacant after the death of PML-N\u2019s Raja Iqbal Mehdi. For the by-election, his son Matloob Mehdi had been fielded by the party. He was challenged by PTI\u2019s Fawad Hussain, a TV anchor who launched his political career from the platform of the PML-Q, then joined the Musharraf-led All Pakistan Muslim League but later defected to the PPP. Mr Hussain also alleged that rigging had taken place at a couple of polling stations.

It was the party which was going to be a blast of surprises. I had invited my friends to a party. Right above the entrance I had placed a small bucket and attached a rope. The surprise was inside the bucket. As soon as I heard the sounds from outside the house, I knew my \u2018guests\u2019 had arrived. They rang the bell and I opened the door.Fauz, Umar and Bilal jumped with fear because the moment they stepped in, the bucket turned upside down and lizards dropped on their shoulders.

We first darted towards the Dodging Cars but my friends were clueless about the whole \u2018Dodging cars\u2019 process, mechanism, acceleration and rules. I became their driving instructor and explained to them where the accelerator was and how it worked. \u201cWe get it,\u201d Bilal shouted like it was kindergarten stuff. I shrugged my shoulders and sat down in my car. When the whistle blew, the violence began. \u201cDid you get it, Bilal?\u201d I shouted repeatedly as I banged my car full force into his motionless vehicle. I could see his eyes growing wide. Fauz and Umar were so entangled by the mechanisms of their own cars that they forgot to drive, or dodge the other drivers. When the action came to a dizzying end, Omar, Fauz and Bilal were gazing at the cars as if they had just been in a train wreck. But they were crazy enough to plead for round two. I have seen that Dodging Cars literally knocks all sadness out of its passengers. By the time my friends had gotten the hang of things, it was the fifth round.

Just then I saw my father walking towards us with a bag around his shoulder. He unzipped it and out came a brand new cricket bat, wicket and ball. We jumped with delight. We played in the rain till it was dusk and our clothes were dripping with mud. Every moment I spend with my father and my old friends was a party. It took us 90 minutes to get to my house because of the traffic jam arising from the rain and the kicker was that Omar, Bilal and Fauz\u2019s parents had shown up in their respective cars.

{"1281335": {"date": "Updated June 15, 2016", "article": "The Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia is not one pilgrims or foreign tourists normally visit. Set against the Persian Gulf, it is the heart of the kingdom\u2019s oil industry. Unsurprisingly, it is also home to most of its migrant workers whose labour populates this sector.Other than migrant workers, mostly Pakistani, Indian, Sri Lankan or from one or another poor labour-exporting nation, the Eastern Province is also home to the majority of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shia population. Perhaps because of this diverse mix, the province has also been the place where the government has chosen to launch a programme called \u2018Ehna al-Ahl\u2019 or \u2018We are one family\u2019. According to an article in the Saudi Gazette, this programme, which organises performances in the region\u2019s malls and arranges for the distribution of brochures, is meant to enhance national cohesion and denounce extremism and divisions. The programme is supposed to last throughout the month of Ramazan.It can be safely assumed, however, that the Pakistanis labouring in the Eastern Province are not part of the \u2018one family\u2019 whose cohesion and lack of division is a priority for the kingdom. Among them is Mohammad Ilyas who works as the head of budgeting and finance at a multinational steel company. For several months now, Mr Ilyas has been trying to obtain an exit permit that would enable him to visit Pakistan. As some may remember, a confusing directive by the Saudi government several months ago stated that Pakistani workers living in Saudi Arabia would only be permitted to visit Pakistan once every year. A few weeks later, however, the Saudi government said that the directive had been withdrawn and that Pakistani workers could go back home for visits multiple times as they did in previous years.\nThe issue of Pakistani workers trapped in Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern region deserves the urgent attention of both Islamabad and Riyadh.\n\nThe renewed permission to leave more than once seems only to apply to Pakistanis in certain parts of the kingdom. In the Eastern Province, which includes the areas of Jubail and Dammam, however, things are far more complicated. As per the kingdom\u2019s latest requirements, workers must apply for the entry/exit permit through the computerised system known as muqeem. However, when Mohammad Ilyas and others in the Eastern Province use it to apply for the permit, the system gives them an error message and asks them to visit the passport office in Jubail in person. Both Mr Ilyas and his company representative have visited the passport office numerous times. When Mr Ilyas did so, the people at the passport office told him that he was only permitted to visit Pakistan once a year and that if he could not obtain a permit online, he simply could not go home. To add to the humiliation of denied workers like Mr Ilyas, colleagues of different nationalities, including Indians, have no problem obtaining the multiple exit/re-entry permit via the system and can visit home as many times as they wish.Nor is Mohammad Ilyas alone in this predicament. According to the online forum Life in Saudi Arabia, where numerous overseas Pakistani workers share their issues, many other Pakistanis in the Eastern Province are similarly being denied exit permits to go home. Saudi officials at the passport office either tell them that they must try again online or simply state that no permit will be issued at the office itself. In other cases they are told that they have already visited Pakistan more than once this year and are hence not eligible for an exit permit.On May 5, the embassy of Pakistan in Riyadh took note of the problem. The press release posted on the embassy\u2019s website says: \u201cThe embassy of Pakistan, Riyadh is aware of the fact that some of our nationals face difficulty in obtaining multiple exit/re-entry visa from the passport offices of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The embassy is in constant contact with the concerned authorities to resolve the matter.\u201d In a previous communication issued on April 16, the embassy has stated that it had brought up the issue in writing and in person with the Saudi authorities concerned and was trying its level best to handle the situation.It is now June 15 and Mohammad Ilyas (who has lived and worked in Saudi Arabia for the past 10 years) and many other Pakistani workers in the Eastern Province continue to be without exit/re-entry permits and are hence unable to leave the kingdom. It is true that the embassy of Pakistan has many issues on its hands. Some weeks ago, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed that over 2,000 Pakistanis are languishing in Saudi jails on various charges. The Pakistani embassy is the only recourse for all of these accused. Add to this the demands of the upcoming Haj season and the ever larger number of pilgrims that wish to travel to Makkah, and you have a small consular staff beset with large problems.Even so, the issue of Pakistani workers trapped in Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern region is one deserving the urgent attention of both governments. At the Saudi end, the kingdom\u2019s commitment to the principles of justice and fair treatment, particularly in this, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar, means that they should not entrap Pakistani workers in a situation that is akin to enslavement.At the Pakistani end, some honest answers must be demanded on the discrepancy between the \u2018official\u2019 statements given by the Saudi government\u2019s representatives (ones that state that no restriction exists on the multiple exit/re-entry of Pakistani workers) and the reality via which Pakistani workers are being denied exit.It is Ramazan now and soon it will be Eid. Pakistan\u2019s workers \u2014 forced abroad because of the scant sources of employment at home \u2014 should not be permitted to become pawns of a Saudi government that seems to care little about whether or not they can be with their families for the holiday. Workers, it must be remembered, are not slaves chained to their place of employment and must be accorded the very basic right to leave and return.

{"1281385": {"date": "September 04, 2016", "article": "Everyone\u2019s interested in Reham Khan\u2019s business, which might be why the former TV host has tread carefully these past few months. The result? Reham\u2019s regular presence on billboards promoting her talk show Tabdeeli has been quietly replaced by her perennially active Twitter feed and stories about her personal life that graced tabloids in Britain have tapered off. But this month Reham will find herself in the spotlight again, and for very different reasons. She\u2019s one of the producers behind upcoming film Janaan, starring Armeena Rana Khan, Bilal Ashraf and Ali Rehman Khan, and is reinventing herself as a devoted patron of the arts. \u201cIn the Pakistani entertainment industry it\u2019s very, very difficult to get your foot in the door if you don\u2019t have a network in Karachi or Lahore or in the film circle,\u201d says Reham during our chat. \u201cSo I try to facilitate anyone under 30 if they want to improve their skills. I tend to mentor young people in the creative arts anyway, because I did that for the BBC for five years.\u201dIn a sense, Reham\u2019s sympathy for young talent others might deem the underdog is congruent with her recent brush with fame and the media. Both during and after her brief 2015 marriage to PTI Chairman Imran Khan, Reham was dismissed as, at best, \u201ca weather girl,\u201d and at worst, a threat to her spouse\u2019s political future.\nReham Khan is recasting herself as patron of the arts and the youth. She opens up about Pakistani cinema, dealing with abuse ... and love.\n\nSo why has she decided to plunge back into public life, that too through a medium with which she has little experience? In this candid exchange, Reham minces no words as she talks about present-day Pakistani cinema, being a role model \u2013 and love.What prompted you to get involved with producing Janaan, a film that focuses on Pakhtun culture?Reham Khan: Janaan is very much a romantic comedy. It\u2019s light, fluffy and doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything serious. It\u2019s a contemporary film, a story from our own families, such as what happens when a modern Pakhtun wants to marry a Punjabi. But we have addressed our genuine problems as well, such as the Punjabi-Pakhtun rift. I\u2019m Swati. [In film], I think we should promote communities that we know and understand and that haven\u2019t been promoted. The Pakhtun voice has disappeared. The piecemeal offering in dramas is a stereotypical character, with the Chitrali topi atop the head, weapon in hand. I felt very strongly that this is not the Pakhtun culture I know and love.How is Janaan different from other, recently released Pakistani films?RK: One of the things my family found very objectionable [in recent films] \u2013 mind you, we\u2019re from abroad \u2013 was language that was objectionable for family viewing. Two films we watched featured open swearing in Urdu and English and then innuendos, which made it very uncomfortable for us. Not just because they were sexual innuendos, in a very cheap way, but because they contained a lot of misogynistic messages.For me, film is a responsibility. For example, if we\u2019re teaching people that they can cheat on their wives in Bangkok... Although you might have a moral at the end of the story, you\u2019ll have people actually pick up these messages from films.\n\u201cI\u2019m a film buff. I don\u2019t watch much TV, but I watch a lot of films in the cinema and it frustrated me to go and see poorly made films coming out of Pakistan.\u201d\n\nApart from cliches about Pakhtun culture, what other stereotypes does the film break?RK: Well, in Janaan the protagonists are all women. So the chunkier, meatier role is leading lady Armeena\u2019s. She is the one who precipitates things, she is the catalyst in the film. Likewise, the dadi, the phupi, the second leading ladies in the subplot, they\u2019re all very strong characters.Who financed Janaan?RK: Contrary to what has been said about the film, it was the finance that we struggled with. Investors feel film is a very risky venture, and it is, but somebody has to do it. See, I\u2019ve taken a major risk by giving the film my name since I have given these boys a lot of independence. It\u2019s important that they learn from their mistakes and they learn to work independently. Finance was a big issue.In the end we didn\u2019t get financed from Pakistan, we got better finances from a British-Asian route, because they take risks more than Pakistanis. Apart from finances, what was the most difficult aspect of making Janaan?\n\n\n\nRK: We faced a lot of problems. Children here have done an MA or BA but they can\u2019t write a decent email or CV. I used to work for news channels and they go for cheap labour \u2013 but a cameraman paid 8,000 rupees will only do 8,000 rupees worth of work. If you don\u2019t spend on skilled labour, your own quality [of work] will suffer. The government has to support these projects. If it supports [films] then the corporates will also support them. Initially, the government should support the industry through tax exemptions. Of course it\u2019s a big risk but there needs to be some sort of [financial] attraction to come into this. PTV has lots of space which should be used. There is a PTV Academy, which is empty. It\u2019s a big, huge resource which is empty.You\u2019re a journalist by profession, why did you decide to go into film?RK: Personally, my daily routine is journalism.But people don\u2019t read books anymore, people don\u2019t even listen to the local mullah anymore, the message that you want to convey will be conveyed through the media. And of course, the bigger the medium, the bigger the message, the more emphatic the message.When you walk into the cinema you have to switch your phones off, you get involved with the big screen, you cry with the film, you laugh with the film. It actually drives the message home far stronger than when you quickly see it on your phone. If you look at things in international terms, a lot of the way we think is because of Hollywood, [or] because of Bollywood.So these conversations are very important.And I have always been fascinated by films. I\u2019m a film buff. I don\u2019t watch much TV, but I watch a lot of films in the cinema and I think in Pakistan there has been a lack of this, which just annoyed me. It frustrated me to go and see poorly-made films coming out of Pakistan. Is that also why your own show went off the air? Was it not able to maintain the standards that you wanted?RK: I\u2019ve always been very careful and with journalism it\u2019s not a good idea to take a break. But of course, I got married [to a politician] and I couldn\u2019t work on TV. When I restarted I really wanted to bring that change.But now nobody watches TV like that. So the young people, or people like me who pretend to be young, watch everything online. Traditional news channels really limit me.How have you dealt with the ugliness and the accusations that were leveled at you during your marriage and after your divorce? Do you have any advice for young women in the media who might experience the same?\n\n\n\nRK: I do what I do because I have two children who look up to me. So if I pick up a cigarette, I\u2019m their role model. They don\u2019t have a father, they don\u2019t have much of an extended-family support network, so whatever I do, they will inevitably pick it up. The same goes for the women who are looking up to me, whether they\u2019re my daughters or other young women who I know are seeking advice. That\u2019s why I came back because I thought, no, this is not on, you can\u2019t bully a woman, it\u2019s not a woman\u2019s fault she\u2019s divorced. Nine out of 10 times it\u2019s blamed on the woman in our culture and if she\u2019s in the media or twice-divorced, God forbid!I say this to girls in person, I say this in interviews, and you can write this down: work hard, put your head down, stay out of politics. I\u2019m rubbish at politics. [Of course,] it\u2019s harder for a younger girl. I come from a privileged background so I know I can sort this person out.But this needs to change. I\u2019ve had to tell boys working for me to keep a four-pace distance from female co-workers. If you\u2019re in an authoritative position and a younger girl is coming to work, try to be supportive. [Our problem is] we have no support for other female colleagues, we actually back stab them. Janaan is ultimately a film about love. Why were you so enthusiastic about this film after everything you\u2019ve been through with your marriage? What\u2019s your own idea of love?RK: I\u2019m a perfectionist. For me, love is very different from how people think about love in our day and age and particularly in Pakistani culture. For us, love is generally superficial. You know, you see the girl, the girl\u2019s good looking and you think \u2018oh I\u2019m in love with this girl\u2019. For me, it\u2019s not that. Love, for me \u2013 and I think maybe it\u2019s nonexistent, maybe in real life it\u2019s nonexistent \u2013 is the Pakhtun love \u2013 without any bars, go the long haul. It\u2019s giving your life, and sacrificing, whatever it takes. So I don\u2019t believe in this love where people will say, \u2018oh I love my husband but I have my separate life\u2019, I don\u2019t get that. If you want a separate life then you might as well be single, I\u2019d be as brutal as that. I feel like love is about complete commitment, complete fidelity. I must say, it seems like in Pakistan it has become acceptable that fidelity is not expected and I don\u2019t mean only physically. If you can\u2019t confide in someone or keep them as your confidante then what is the point of keeping them in an obviously very intimate relationship. So I\u2019m quite an idealist and perfectionist in those areas. A lot of people criticise me for doing this and that but I don\u2019t think it goes against feminism to give so much and also to want your husband to be successful. I don\u2019t see a clash in that. I think if you can support your husband, or the husband can support the wife, then there\u2019s nothing wrong in that.I think both should do it and it shouldn\u2019t be one-sided but there\u2019s nothing wrong with being devoted to whatever your partner is doing. In Pakistan, that is sometimes seen as negative.Published in Dawn, Sunday Magazine, September 4th, 2016\n", "author": "Hamna Zubair", "title": "FirstPerson: Reinventing Reham"}}

The teaching and non-teaching staff gathered outside the university\u2019s administration block carrying placards and banners in their hands. They also shouted slogans against the Sindh government and demanded that it fulfil the promise of issuing the Rs350 million grant for KU for 2015-16, keeping in view the university\u2019s capacity and expenditures.

They protested against the government\u2019s political interference in the autonomy of public-sector universities. The universities also demanded financial assistance to those universities facing financial crises. Kuts president Dr Shakeel Farooqi, who is also the general secretary of Fapuasa, said that due to lack of funds, the university had not been getting their due rights including medical allowance, leave encashment and increment in the salary as per the rules. They had asked the university\u2019s administration to resolve their issues but there has been no outcome yet. KU is bearing a loss of Rs800 million every year on account of salaries because the government only releases salaries for eight months, while the university administration manages the remaining expenditures through tuition fees, he added. Unfortunately, salaries have not been paid since the last two months, he said. Dr Farooqi showed concern that after the 18th amendment the Sindh government failed to protect the rights of university employees.

Stedman\u2019s bestselling novel, this unapologetically weepy, handsomely staged melodrama revolves around an almost superhumanly restrained protagonist, lighthouse keeper and traumatised World War I veteran, Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender).But counterbalancing his character\u2019s chiseled stoicism is a willingness to go for broke \u2014 in the form of garment-rending scenes of loss and separation, and lots of tear-streaked close-ups \u2014 that indicate where the movie\u2019s temperamental heart really lies.As The Light Between Oceans opens, Tom has just fetched up in a coastal Australian town in order to replace the light keeper who\u2019s convalescing, a prologue eerily reminiscent of The Shining, with its intimations of death and madness. But where the tale could easily accommodate the moody conventions of gothic horror, Stedman and Cianfrance instead embrace its fable-like lyricism and dewy-eyed tragedy: in time, Tom takes Isabel (Alicia Vikander) \u2014 a comely, refreshingly direct local girl \u2014 as his wife, and they repair to his little island for an enchanted honeymoon period.But sadness soon descends, when they\u2019re unable to start a biological family. Then, when circumstances conspire to bring a baby into their lives, The Light Between Oceans becomes a fraught, occasionally manipulative conundrum that the author and film-maker desperately try to portray as a genuine moral quandary, when any clear-thinking person can discern folly and selfishness on one hand and the clear, correct path on the other.Cianfrance knows his way around domestic drama \u2014 he wrote and directed the shattering marriage-drama Blue Valentine, with Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. But he\u2019s hemmed in by material that\u2019s not only dubiously equivocating but structurally ungainly, especially when another love story emerges to compete with the idealised portrait of Tom and Isabel\u2019s marital devotion.That second tale is embodied by Rachel Weisz in a performance that\u2019s as honest and touching as Vikander\u2019s is keen{"1281005": {"date": "Updated August 31, 2016", "article": "DHAKA: A wealthy tycoon who was a chief financier for Bangladesh\u2019s largest Islamist party could be executed in days after losing his final appeal on Tuesday against a death sentence from a controversial war crimes tribunal.The Supreme Court rejected Mir Quasem Ali\u2019s last attempt to overturn the death penalty handed down two years ago by the domestic tribunal for murders committed during Bangladesh\u2019s 1971 independence conflict. \u201cNow he has a chance to seek presidential clemency. Or else the verdict could be executed anytime whenever the state wants,\u201d Attorney General Mahbubey Alam told reporters.Five opposition leaders including four leading Islamists have already been executed for war crimes since 2013. They were all hanged just days after their appeals were rejected by the Supreme Court.Their families said they had refused to seek a presidential pardon as they did not want to legitimise the whole trials process.Ali, who became a shipping and real estate tycoon, was convicted in November 2014 of a series of crimes during Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan, including the abduction and murder of a young independence fighter.Tuesday\u2019s decision is considered a major blow for the Jamaat-i-Islami party, which the 63-year-old Ali had helped revive by setting up charities, businesses and trusts linked to it after it was allowed to operate in the late 1970s.His son Mir Ahmed Bin Quasem, who was part of his legal defence team, was allegedly abducted by security forces earlier in August, which critics say was an attempt to sow fear and prevent protests against the imminent execution.Security was tight in Dhaka on Tuesday, even though the party has in recent months eschewed violent protests in reaction to war crimes verdicts and there was no immediate sign of unrest.The war crimes tribunal set up by the government has divided the country, with supporters of Jamaat and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) branding them a sham aimed at eliminating their leaders.The executions and convictions of Jamaat officials plunged Bangladesh into one of its worst crises in 2013 when tens of thousands of Islamist activists clashed with police in protests that left some 500 people dead.The Islamist party, which is banned from contesting elections, called a nationwide strike on Wednesday, calling the charges against Ali \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cbaseless\u201d and accusing the government of exacting \u201cpolitical vengeance\u201d.TV station shutBefore he was arrested in 2012 on 14 war crimes charges, Ali headed the Diganta Media Corporation, which owns a pro-Jamaat daily and a television station that was shut down in 2013 for stoking religious tensions.Defence lawyers have said the charges against him were baseless. \u201cMir Quasem Ali wasn\u2019t directly involved in war crimes. False witnesses were provided to frame charges against him. The future generation and law experts will scrutinise the verdict whether it was justified,\u201d said Khandker Mahbub Hossain.The court ruling comes a day after a visit to Dhaka by US Secretary of State John Kerry who said the best way to combat extremism was \u201cto live up to the core values of democracy\u201d.Rights groups have criticised the war crimes trials, saying they fall short of international standards and lack any foreign oversight.A group of United Nations human rights experts last week urged Bangladesh to annul Ali\u2019s death sentence and to retry him in compliance with international standards. \u201cInternational law, accepted as binding by Bangladesh, provides that capital punishment may only be imposed following trials that comply with the most stringent requirements of fair trial and due process, or could otherwise be considered an arbitrary execution,\u201d they cautioned.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s government has defended the trials, saying they are needed to heal the wounds of the conflict, which it says left three million people dead.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Bangladesh upholds Islamist tycoon\u2019s death sentence"}}

This is going to be the fourth change of management that the utility has undergone since its privatisation more than a decade ago, and the third change of ownership. The journey the utility has made along the way has been marked with severe crises and occasional confrontations with the management of Pepco and the water and power ministry, and drawn-out wrangling with the finance ministry, as well as with entities belonging to the Sindh government over the settlement of outstanding dues. It has been used as an example of the pitfalls of privatisation in the power sector on some occasions, and as an avatar of its promise on others. The present management deserves credit for bringing the company into profitability after many years of accumulating losses, and investing in the upgrade of its infrastructure. But along the way, a few crucial lessons have also been learned which should play an important role in structuring the sale and the handing over of the enterprise whenever the time comes.Chief amongst these lessons is the fact that being a monopoly power utility serving the country\u2019s largest city, there is a strong and abiding public interest in how it is run. This goes far beyond the recovery-based load-shedding regime that the present management inaugurated a few years ago. There is the matter of the power purchase agreement with the federal government, gas allocations, fuel adjustment surcharges and the roster of items to be considered as passed through in the tariff. In each case, strong public interest is touched upon and for this reason it is crucial that the transaction, if and when it occurs, be as transparent as possible with all opportunities to solicit stakeholder input. The forthcoming determination of a multi-year tariff for K-Electric provides a good opportunity for this. Nepra should ensure that the hearing on the tariff is conducted in Karachi and advertised well in advance.There is a tendency in Pakistan these days to view Chinese investors through a national security lens and see them as deserving of special treatment. This perception should be meticulously kept away from any K-Electric deal, which is not part of CPEC, nor does it merit any special treatment. This is the time for the power regulator to step forward and do its job in safeguarding the public interest, through strong stakeholder input. The multi-year tariff is only part of this obligation. We need to know more about the investment scheme of the new investor, should there be one, as well as the plans it has to reduce distribution losses, even as we ensure that it does not turn its back on the poorer neighbourhoods of the city.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Chinese interest in K-Electric"}}

Mr Burney informed the audience that the World of Google publishing has users, advertisers and publishers and AdSense facilitates publishers earn money in a seamless manner. Anything between 100 and 50,000 dollars could be generated monthly, he added. An introduction to the two monetization products \u2014 Google AdSense and Google AdMob \u2014 followed. The audience was informed that AdSense had more than two million members and AdWords had one million plus members. Through AdSense you can make money, if you\u2019re a YouTube blogger, publisher etc. and only 20 per cent publishers are brought on board by Google as they are stringent about selecting the best, according to the experts. Basically AdSense connects advertisers to users so that users can make money. Leading media organizations like Dawn and Jang are working with Google in this domain. Placing of advertisements on various web content is how bloggers and publishers earn good money. The more traffic on your site, the more revenue you earn.

On the other hand, district officer labour Saeed Dhillon, in a statement, claimed the minimum wage notification had been implemented in the district and he had issued challans to more than a dozen brick kiln owners for not paying workers Rs1,036 per 1,000 bricks. The violators were taken to the court while action was still going on against others. At the hunger strike camp, Muhammad Shabbir and others again blamed the district officer labour for putting pressure on them to accept the wages being paid by the kiln owners. They warned that if any mishap occurred during the hunger strike, Mr Dhillon and district administration would be held responsible. They had earlier alleged that the district labour officer  was supporting the kiln owners. \nLabour officer says minimum wage order being implemented\n\nDLO Saeed Dhillon refuted the allegations against him that he was supporting the brick kiln owners and not taking action against them for violating the minimum wage notification. He said he could not go beyond his authority under the law but he was making all efforts to resolve this issue. He claimed Section 144 CrPC had been imposed for violators. Mr Dhilon further said the representatives of owners had requested the district administration for giving them time for implementation till December; however, the DCO had denied their request and asked them to implement the notification without delay. He said the owners were being persuaded to resolve the issue and added the hunger strike of the workers had no legal grounds in the existing circumstances. Meanwhile, an emergent meeting of District Brick Kiln Owners Association was also held in which the speakers, \nincluding its president Sheikh Amer Fayaz, Ikram Hafeez, Muhammad Ibrahim, Muhammad Yasin and Zeshan Randhawa, said the so-called labour leaders were blackmailing the kiln owners for their vested interests. They claimed kiln owners of Toba were paying the highest wages to their workers in the whole Faisalabad division. They claimed that those holding the hunger strike were not the kiln workers.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "The Newspaper's Correspondent", "title": "Brick kiln workers strike continues"}}

In his budget speech, the tehsil nazim said the devastating flash floods of the last year had left the infrastructure of roads, water supply and irrigation damaged heavily due to which whole of the budget was diverted to rehabilitation of the battered infrastructures. He said situation was still grim as the magnitude of loss was colossal and the resources available with the council were meager which led to the deficit in the budget. He urged the house members to come forward with practicable and viable proposals to augment and supplement the resources of the council, which also included levying of local taxes. Mr Ilyas said the flood-hit people were still waiting for the rehabilitation of their basic infrastructures of water supply and irrigation as shortage of irrigation water had inflicted heavy losses on them.

Uzbekistan\u2019s president, a dictator who was ruthless with his opponents and even locked away his own daughter, is rumoured to have died on Monday, though there has been no official confirmation.On Tuesday, state television ran segments about fruit, vegetables and the upcoming Independence Day celebrations, without mentioning a word about the president\u2019s health.The president\u2019s younger daughter, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva, confirmed rumours of her father\u2019s ill-health on Instagram on Monday, claiming he was in a stable condition in hospital after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage. The Russia-based Fergana news agency, which first broke news of Karimov\u2019s deterioration, announced on Monday evening that the dictator had died that afternoon.On Wednesday, according to an AFP report, she said in an Instagram message that her father was recovering from a brain haemorrhage and thanked well-wishers for their support, saying this was helping her father\u2019s recovery.Daniil Kislov, who runs Fergana, told The Guardian on Tuesday he was \u201c99 per cent sure\u201d that Karimov had died. Other Uzbekistan watchers agreed the leader was dead or at least in such a condition that he would never be able to rule the country again, though details were scarce.Steve Swerdlow, a Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, who has spent many years working on Uzbek cases, said: \u201cWe have no idea what day the initial incident actually happened. Some have said it was Thursday, some said it was Saturday. It\u2019s just like the Karimov regime to be so cowardly and so opaque that they can\u2019t even give us the concrete information. Even in death, Karimov is a wily fox.\u201dAssuming that Karimov is dead, the question of succession now looms large. When the longstanding dictator in neighbouring Turkmenistan died a decade ago, he was swiftly replaced by his former minister of health and dentist, who went about dismantling his predecessor\u2019s personality cult and building his own.Many analysts suspect a plan must have been in place in Uzbekistan given Karimov\u2019s increasing frailness over recent years, but whether or not it is adhered to is another matter.The country is one of the most closed and secretive in the world.Karimov rarely travelled abroad and almost never gave interviews. Few outsiders have insight into the power struggles at play behind closed doors, and diplomats and analysts are waiting to see whether the transition will be smooth or bumpy.Whatever happens, it will be unchartered territory. The country has no experience of living without Karimov, who was the last Soviet party boss when Uzbekistan was still part of the USSR, and has governed since independence in 1991. Uzbeks were due to mark 25 years of independence on Thursday, but the local BBC service reported that the celebrations had been cancelled.Kislov said he had received information from his sources that all key officials had their mobile telephones blocked on Tuesday, possibly to prevent them from organising or discussing potential plots.\u201cWe really don\u2019t know very much. Maybe there was a plan put in place before. Maybe there is a battle going on now. Maybe there are negotiations. There is no information,\u201d he said.Uzbekistan borders Afghanistan and has been seen as strategically vital by both Russia and the west, who were willing to turn a blind eye to Karimov\u2019s human rights abuses in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in return for access to Uzbekistan\u2019s airbases. In 2004 Britain sacked its ambassador to the country, Craig Murray, for speaking out over rights abuses.The next year, Karimov\u2019s security forces gunned down hundreds of unarmed protesters in the town of Andijan , a massacre condemned by international rights groups but never properly investigated.\u201cIt\u2019s the bloodiest event outside of an armed conflict on the territory of the former Soviet Union,\u201d said Swerdlow. \u201cThat day defines Karimov more than anything else. The fact he leaves this world not having to answer for any of that is very sad for the victims.\u201dKarimov has been accused of all manner of rights abuses and torture, and in recent years attention has also focused on his family. Nothing is known about the current whereabouts of his older daughter, Gulnara Karimova. For a long time she was considered a potential successor to her father, and was a highly public figure, launching a fashion brand and a music career under the name Googoosha. She even released a bizarre love duet with G\u00e9rard Depardieu.In 2014 Gulnara\u2019s son, Islam Karimov Jr, who was studying at Oxford Brookes University, told The Guardian he feared for his mother\u2019s life, and revealed an extraordinary feud brewing in the first family. He explained how he and his mother had been kept from visiting his grandfather, the president, by armed guards, and that when they finally did get an audience, there was an almighty showdown involving the president, his wife, and their daughter. Shortly after, Gulnara was placed under house arrest, and nothing is known of her whereabouts since, or even whether she is still alive.\u201cThere are plenty of rumours but no solid facts about Gulnara for two years already,\u201d said Kislov.Details may become clear later in the week, when it will be difficult for the authorities not to mention and explain Karimov\u2019s absence if celebrations go ahead. Gulnara is believed to be out of the running for successor, with most analysts agreeing that the prime minister and the head of the security services are the main centres of power.Deidre Tynan, Central Asia project director at International Crisis Group, said: \u201cIf there is disagreement or conflict between different players, they will try to keep it behind closed doors.

The warning was issued by a two-judge SC bench headed by Justice Dost Mohammad Khan, after Law and Justice Commission Secretary Sarwar Khan \u2013 who has been appointed a focal person of an expert group constituted by the court \u2013 said none of the secretaries he twice invited to meetings turned up. The court had taken up a petition moved by Aasim Sajjad Akhtar, through his counsel Abid Hassan Minto, seeking a declaration that the state is bound by the Constitution to provide evicted katchi abadi residents shelter and other amenities. \nSenior officials\u2019 salaries to be attached if lethargy towards katchi abadi order persists\n\nThe petitioners also expressed concern over the manner in which residents of the I-11 katchi abadi were evicted by the Capital Development Authority (CDA), in an operation conducted on July 30 last year. In an order issued on April 20, the SC tasked the CDA and the federal and provincial governments with developing uniform legislation to devise inexpensive, low-cost housing for the destitute and shelterless. Subsequently, Sarwar Khan was appointed coordinator for facilitating and providing secretarial facilities to the working group, and governments were directed to ensure regular budgetary allocation for the smooth functioning of the group. The court ordered the law officers of all the provinces, and the respective finance directors, to attach the salaries of the officers assigned the task of developing the aforementioned uniform policy, in case any default was committed on their part. The court added that, in addition to their salaries being attached, the officers would also be proceeded against for contempt of court due to their lethargic attitude toward deciding a matter that has been pending for the last year. The court regretted that the CDA and the relevant federal and provincial departments were not interested in deciding the matter once and for all, through a proper policy. The court said this was unacceptable, and it would proceed against such a delinquent attitude of the relevant officers. However, it decided to issue a final warning, and directed the coordinator to convene yet another meeting of the relevant provincial secretaries and senior-most CDA officials \u2013 such as the member planning and housing and survey. It would be the responsibility of the coordinator to intimate, even in chambers, if any government official failed to take interest in the meeting of the expert group, the court said. The court ordered that in the next meeting, the expert group will finalise the fundamental features of the policy to provide low-cost housing facilities through legislation, to those who cannot afford modest housing. This should be done keeping in view areas\u2019 environment and soil condition. The policy should also guard the interest of the state by protecting it from land grabbers, the order said. The court has allowed two months for the formulation of this policy. If nothing is developed, the respective chief secretaries and CDA chairman will personally appear before the court on the next hearing date to explain the attitude towards court orders. The court also directed the CDA and government departments to conduct a comprehensive survey of katchi abadis with the assistance of Survey of Pakistan, Google Maps and other sources, and for which surveyors can also sign a memorandum of understanding with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to permanently register the family trees of those living in katchi abadis. This would also help authorities prevent undue dual benefits to the same family.
