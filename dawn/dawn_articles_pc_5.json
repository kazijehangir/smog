Mr Burney informed the audience that the World of Google publishing has users, advertisers and publishers and AdSense facilitates publishers earn money in a seamless manner. Anything between 100 and 50,000 dollars could be generated monthly, he added. An introduction to the two monetization products \u2014 Google AdSense and Google AdMob \u2014 followed. The audience was informed that AdSense had more than two million members and AdWords had one million plus members. Through AdSense you can make money, if you\u2019re a YouTube blogger, publisher etc. and only 20 per cent publishers are brought on board by Google as they are stringent about selecting the best, according to the experts. Basically AdSense connects advertisers to users so that users can make money. Leading media organizations like Dawn and Jang are working with Google in this domain. Placing of advertisements on various web content is how bloggers and publishers earn good money. The more traffic on your site, the more revenue you earn. One must first concentrate on generating traffic on their website and then think about monetizing it. Useful tips on making the most of AdSense were shared by Mr Burney. Some heart-warming case studies in form of videos were also shared with the audience to show the impact AdSense had on the lives of ordinary people by empowering them financially. Introducing Google tool, AdMob, Mr Ahmed highlighted what made a great app and what did users require in an app. The more user friendly and functional the app, the more popular it would be. The activity proved to be successful as 1,100 plus registrations were received for the session. Dr Shakeel Khoja of the Faculty of Computer Science, said the tech-talk was a promising initiative of its kind and he hoped that Google would hold such informative sessions for the Pakistani youth in the future as well.

The warning was issued by a two-judge SC bench headed by Justice Dost Mohammad Khan, after Law and Justice Commission Secretary Sarwar Khan \u2013 who has been appointed a focal person of an expert group constituted by the court \u2013 said none of the secretaries he twice invited to meetings turned up. The court had taken up a petition moved by Aasim Sajjad Akhtar, through his counsel Abid Hassan Minto, seeking a declaration that the state is bound by the Constitution to provide evicted katchi abadi residents shelter and other amenities. \nSenior officials\u2019 salaries to be attached if lethargy towards katchi abadi order persists\n\nThe petitioners also expressed concern over the manner in which residents of the I-11 katchi abadi were evicted by the Capital Development Authority (CDA), in an operation conducted on July 30 last year. In an order issued on April 20, the SC tasked the CDA and the federal and provincial governments with developing uniform legislation to devise inexpensive, low-cost housing for the destitute and shelterless. Subsequently, Sarwar Khan was appointed coordinator for facilitating and providing secretarial facilities to the working group, and governments were directed to ensure regular budgetary allocation for the smooth functioning of the group. The court ordered the law officers of all the provinces, and the respective finance directors, to attach the salaries of the officers assigned the task of developing the aforementioned uniform policy, in case any default was committed on their part. The court added that, in addition to their salaries being attached, the officers would also be proceeded against for contempt of court due to their lethargic attitude toward deciding a matter that has been pending for the last year. The court regretted that the CDA and the relevant federal and provincial departments were not interested in deciding the matter once and for all, through a proper policy. The court said this was unacceptable, and it would proceed against such a delinquent attitude of the relevant officers. However, it decided to issue a final warning, and directed the coordinator to convene yet another meeting of the relevant provincial secretaries and senior-most CDA officials \u2013 such as the member planning and housing and survey. It would be the responsibility of the coordinator to intimate, even in chambers, if any government official failed to take interest in the meeting of the expert group, the court said. The court ordered that in the next meeting, the expert group will finalise the fundamental features of the policy to provide low-cost housing facilities through legislation, to those who cannot afford modest housing. This should be done keeping in view areas\u2019 environment and soil condition. The policy should also guard the interest of the state by protecting it from land grabbers, the order said. The court has allowed two months for the formulation of this policy. If nothing is developed, the respective chief secretaries and CDA chairman will personally appear before the court on the next hearing date to explain the attitude towards court orders. The court also directed the CDA and government departments to conduct a comprehensive survey of katchi abadis with the assistance of Survey of Pakistan, Google Maps and other sources, and for which surveyors can also sign a memorandum of understanding with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to permanently register the family trees of those living in katchi abadis. This would also help authorities prevent undue dual benefits to the same family. The court also asked the federal and provincial governments to explain why budgetary allocations were not made for the expert group in their respective budgets. The court order will be sent to the principal secretary to the prime minister, the provincial chief secretaries, principal secretaries to all chief ministers, the CDA chairman, the Islamabad mayor, and the secretaries of Cabinet Division, Establishment Division and climate change. Meanwhile, the Aug 26, 2015 stay order restraining the capital administration from demolishing any house in existing katchi abadis will remain in place, the SC said.

In Jhelum, PTI candidate Fawad Chaudhry was outnumbered by PML-N\u2019s Matloob Mehdi with a margin of about 5,000 votes in the unofficial results of 309 of the 314 polling stations. The margin of win in the Vehari by-polls was narrow \u2014 1,056 votes. Polling started at 8pm and continued till 5pm in a largely peaceful way. Besides police, contingents of army and \nRangers were deployed in the two constituencies to prevent any untoward incident. However, independent candidate Mirza Mehboob Rabbani was allegedly tortured by PML-N activists over a trivial issue in Vehari, while Jhelum witnessed a post-polling clash resulting in bullet injuries to two activists of the PTI. Voter turnout remained quite low in Jhelum where at one polling station (Langar) not even a single vote was cast. The number of registered voters there was 1,384. Turnout was around 50 per cent in Vehari where PML-N\u2019s Yousuf Kasilia and PTI\u2019s Ayesha Nazir Jutt had a close contest. The number of registered voters in NA-63 Jhelum was 427,757 and in PP-232 Vehari 191,092. The Vehari seat had fallen vacant after an election tribunal unseated Mr Kasilia for submitting wrong statement of assets. During the 2013 general elections, he had won from the constituency as an independent candidate and later joined the PML-N. His supporters danced to the beat of drum soon after the announcement of unofficial results. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif\u2019s daughter Maryam Nawaz celebrated the win through her Tweet, \u201cDekho, dekho kaun aaya (See, who has come)\u201d. Ayesha Jutt alleged that PML-N activists had forcibly stopped the polling process at some stations and that election results were manipulated, otherwise she was leading with a good margin. Also levelling allegations of pre-poll rigging, she vowed to use all options at her disposal for fighting against the \u201crigging\u201d. The Jhelum seat had fallen vacant after the death of PML-N\u2019s Raja Iqbal Mehdi. For the by-election, his son Matloob Mehdi had been fielded by the party. He was challenged by PTI\u2019s Fawad Hussain, a TV anchor who launched his political career from the platform of the PML-Q, then joined the Musharraf-led All Pakistan Muslim League but later defected to the PPP. Mr Hussain also alleged that rigging had taken place at a couple of polling stations.

It was the party which was going to be a blast of surprises. I had invited my friends to a party. Right above the entrance I had placed a small bucket and attached a rope. The surprise was inside the bucket. As soon as I heard the sounds from outside the house, I knew my \u2018guests\u2019 had arrived. They rang the bell and I opened the door.Fauz, Umar and Bilal jumped with fear because the moment they stepped in, the bucket turned upside down and lizards dropped on their shoulders.

We first darted towards the Dodging Cars but my friends were clueless about the whole \u2018Dodging cars\u2019 process, mechanism, acceleration and rules. I became their driving instructor and explained to them where the accelerator was and how it worked. \u201cWe get it,\u201d Bilal shouted like it was kindergarten stuff. I shrugged my shoulders and sat down in my car. When the whistle blew, the violence began. \u201cDid you get it, Bilal?\u201d I shouted repeatedly as I banged my car full force into his motionless vehicle. I could see his eyes growing wide. Fauz and Umar were so entangled by the mechanisms of their own cars that they forgot to drive, or dodge the other drivers. When the action came to a dizzying end, Omar, Fauz and Bilal were gazing at the cars as if they had just been in a train wreck. But they were crazy enough to plead for round two. I have seen that Dodging Cars literally knocks all sadness out of its passengers. By the time my friends had gotten the hang of things, it was the fifth round.

Just then I saw my father walking towards us with a bag around his shoulder. He unzipped it and out came a brand new cricket bat, wicket and ball. We jumped with delight. We played in the rain till it was dusk and our clothes were dripping with mud. Every moment I spend with my father and my old friends was a party. It took us 90 minutes to get to my house because of the traffic jam arising from the rain and the kicker was that Omar, Bilal and Fauz\u2019s parents had shown up in their respective cars.

{"1281335": {"date": "Updated June 15, 2016", "article": "The Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia is not one pilgrims or foreign tourists normally visit. Set against the Persian Gulf, it is the heart of the kingdom\u2019s oil industry. Unsurprisingly, it is also home to most of its migrant workers whose labour populates this sector.Other than migrant workers, mostly Pakistani, Indian, Sri Lankan or from one or another poor labour-exporting nation, the Eastern Province is also home to the majority of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shia population. Perhaps because of this diverse mix, the province has also been the place where the government has chosen to launch a programme called \u2018Ehna al-Ahl\u2019 or \u2018We are one family\u2019. According to an article in the Saudi Gazette, this programme, which organises performances in the region\u2019s malls and arranges for the distribution of brochures, is meant to enhance national cohesion and denounce extremism and divisions. The programme is supposed to last throughout the month of Ramazan.It can be safely assumed, however, that the Pakistanis labouring in the Eastern Province are not part of the \u2018one family\u2019 whose cohesion and lack of division is a priority for the kingdom. Among them is Mohammad Ilyas who works as the head of budgeting and finance at a multinational steel company. For several months now, Mr Ilyas has been trying to obtain an exit permit that would enable him to visit Pakistan. As some may remember, a confusing directive by the Saudi government several months ago stated that Pakistani workers living in Saudi Arabia would only be permitted to visit Pakistan once every year. A few weeks later, however, the Saudi government said that the directive had been withdrawn and that Pakistani workers could go back home for visits multiple times as they did in previous years.\nThe issue of Pakistani workers trapped in Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern region deserves the urgent attention of both Islamabad and Riyadh.\n\nThe renewed permission to leave more than once seems only to apply to Pakistanis in certain parts of the kingdom. In the Eastern Province, which includes the areas of Jubail and Dammam, however, things are far more complicated. As per the kingdom\u2019s latest requirements, workers must apply for the entry/exit permit through the computerised system known as muqeem. However, when Mohammad Ilyas and others in the Eastern Province use it to apply for the permit, the system gives them an error message and asks them to visit the passport office in Jubail in person. Both Mr Ilyas and his company representative have visited the passport office numerous times. When Mr Ilyas did so, the people at the passport office told him that he was only permitted to visit Pakistan once a year and that if he could not obtain a permit online, he simply could not go home. To add to the humiliation of denied workers like Mr Ilyas, colleagues of different nationalities, including Indians, have no problem obtaining the multiple exit/re-entry permit via the system and can visit home as many times as they wish.Nor is Mohammad Ilyas alone in this predicament. According to the online forum Life in Saudi Arabia, where numerous overseas Pakistani workers share their issues, many other Pakistanis in the Eastern Province are similarly being denied exit permits to go home. Saudi officials at the passport office either tell them that they must try again online or simply state that no permit will be issued at the office itself. In other cases they are told that they have already visited Pakistan more than once this year and are hence not eligible for an exit permit.On May 5, the embassy of Pakistan in Riyadh took note of the problem. The press release posted on the embassy\u2019s website says: \u201cThe embassy of Pakistan, Riyadh is aware of the fact that some of our nationals face difficulty in obtaining multiple exit/re-entry visa from the passport offices of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The embassy is in constant contact with the concerned authorities to resolve the matter.\u201d In a previous communication issued on April 16, the embassy has stated that it had brought up the issue in writing and in person with the Saudi authorities concerned and was trying its level best to handle the situation.It is now June 15 and Mohammad Ilyas (who has lived and worked in Saudi Arabia for the past 10 years) and many other Pakistani workers in the Eastern Province continue to be without exit/re-entry permits and are hence unable to leave the kingdom. It is true that the embassy of Pakistan has many issues on its hands. Some weeks ago, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed that over 2,000 Pakistanis are languishing in Saudi jails on various charges. The Pakistani embassy is the only recourse for all of these accused. Add to this the demands of the upcoming Haj season and the ever larger number of pilgrims that wish to travel to Makkah, and you have a small consular staff beset with large problems.Even so, the issue of Pakistani workers trapped in Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern region is one deserving the urgent attention of both governments. At the Saudi end, the kingdom\u2019s commitment to the principles of justice and fair treatment, particularly in this, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar, means that they should not entrap Pakistani workers in a situation that is akin to enslavement.At the Pakistani end, some honest answers must be demanded on the discrepancy between the \u2018official\u2019 statements given by the Saudi government\u2019s representatives (ones that state that no restriction exists on the multiple exit/re-entry of Pakistani workers) and the reality via which Pakistani workers are being denied exit.It is Ramazan now and soon it will be Eid. Pakistan\u2019s workers \u2014 forced abroad because of the scant sources of employment at home \u2014 should not be permitted to become pawns of a Saudi government that seems to care little about whether or not they can be with their families for the holiday. Workers, it must be remembered, are not slaves chained to their place of employment and must be accorded the very basic right to leave and return.

{"1281385": {"date": "September 04, 2016", "article": "Everyone\u2019s interested in Reham Khan\u2019s business, which might be why the former TV host has tread carefully these past few months. The result? Reham\u2019s regular presence on billboards promoting her talk show Tabdeeli has been quietly replaced by her perennially active Twitter feed and stories about her personal life that graced tabloids in Britain have tapered off. But this month Reham will find herself in the spotlight again, and for very different reasons. She\u2019s one of the producers behind upcoming film Janaan, starring Armeena Rana Khan, Bilal Ashraf and Ali Rehman Khan, and is reinventing herself as a devoted patron of the arts. \u201cIn the Pakistani entertainment industry it\u2019s very, very difficult to get your foot in the door if you don\u2019t have a network in Karachi or Lahore or in the film circle,\u201d says Reham during our chat. \u201cSo I try to facilitate anyone under 30 if they want to improve their skills. I tend to mentor young people in the creative arts anyway, because I did that for the BBC for five years.\u201dIn a sense, Reham\u2019s sympathy for young talent others might deem the underdog is congruent with her recent brush with fame and the media. Both during and after her brief 2015 marriage to PTI Chairman Imran Khan, Reham was dismissed as, at best, \u201ca weather girl,\u201d and at worst, a threat to her spouse\u2019s political future.\nReham Khan is recasting herself as patron of the arts and the youth. She opens up about Pakistani cinema, dealing with abuse ... and love.\n\nSo why has she decided to plunge back into public life, that too through a medium with which she has little experience? In this candid exchange, Reham minces no words as she talks about present-day Pakistani cinema, being a role model \u2013 and love.What prompted you to get involved with producing Janaan, a film that focuses on Pakhtun culture?Reham Khan: Janaan is very much a romantic comedy. It\u2019s light, fluffy and doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything serious. It\u2019s a contemporary film, a story from our own families, such as what happens when a modern Pakhtun wants to marry a Punjabi. But we have addressed our genuine problems as well, such as the Punjabi-Pakhtun rift. I\u2019m Swati. [In film], I think we should promote communities that we know and understand and that haven\u2019t been promoted. The Pakhtun voice has disappeared. The piecemeal offering in dramas is a stereotypical character, with the Chitrali topi atop the head, weapon in hand. I felt very strongly that this is not the Pakhtun culture I know and love.How is Janaan different from other, recently released Pakistani films?RK: One of the things my family found very objectionable [in recent films] \u2013 mind you, we\u2019re from abroad \u2013 was language that was objectionable for family viewing. Two films we watched featured open swearing in Urdu and English and then innuendos, which made it very uncomfortable for us. Not just because they were sexual innuendos, in a very cheap way, but because they contained a lot of misogynistic messages.For me, film is a responsibility. For example, if we\u2019re teaching people that they can cheat on their wives in Bangkok... Although you might have a moral at the end of the story, you\u2019ll have people actually pick up these messages from films.\n\u201cI\u2019m a film buff. I don\u2019t watch much TV, but I watch a lot of films in the cinema and it frustrated me to go and see poorly made films coming out of Pakistan.\u201d\n\nApart from cliches about Pakhtun culture, what other stereotypes does the film break?RK: Well, in Janaan the protagonists are all women. So the chunkier, meatier role is leading lady Armeena\u2019s. She is the one who precipitates things, she is the catalyst in the film. Likewise, the dadi, the phupi, the second leading ladies in the subplot, they\u2019re all very strong characters.Who financed Janaan?RK: Contrary to what has been said about the film, it was the finance that we struggled with. Investors feel film is a very risky venture, and it is, but somebody has to do it. See, I\u2019ve taken a major risk by giving the film my name since I have given these boys a lot of independence. It\u2019s important that they learn from their mistakes and they learn to work independently. Finance was a big issue.In the end we didn\u2019t get financed from Pakistan, we got better finances from a British-Asian route, because they take risks more than Pakistanis. Apart from finances, what was the most difficult aspect of making Janaan?\n\n\n\nRK: We faced a lot of problems. Children here have done an MA or BA but they can\u2019t write a decent email or CV. I used to work for news channels and they go for cheap labour \u2013 but a cameraman paid 8,000 rupees will only do 8,000 rupees worth of work. If you don\u2019t spend on skilled labour, your own quality [of work] will suffer. The government has to support these projects. If it supports [films] then the corporates will also support them. Initially, the government should support the industry through tax exemptions. Of course it\u2019s a big risk but there needs to be some sort of [financial] attraction to come into this. PTV has lots of space which should be used. There is a PTV Academy, which is empty. It\u2019s a big, huge resource which is empty.You\u2019re a journalist by profession, why did you decide to go into film?RK: Personally, my daily routine is journalism.But people don\u2019t read books anymore, people don\u2019t even listen to the local mullah anymore, the message that you want to convey will be conveyed through the media. And of course, the bigger the medium, the bigger the message, the more emphatic the message.When you walk into the cinema you have to switch your phones off, you get involved with the big screen, you cry with the film, you laugh with the film. It actually drives the message home far stronger than when you quickly see it on your phone. If you look at things in international terms, a lot of the way we think is because of Hollywood, [or] because of Bollywood.So these conversations are very important.And I have always been fascinated by films. I\u2019m a film buff. I don\u2019t watch much TV, but I watch a lot of films in the cinema and I think in Pakistan there has been a lack of this, which just annoyed me. It frustrated me to go and see poorly-made films coming out of Pakistan. Is that also why your own show went off the air? Was it not able to maintain the standards that you wanted?RK: I\u2019ve always been very careful and with journalism it\u2019s not a good idea to take a break. But of course, I got married [to a politician] and I couldn\u2019t work on TV. When I restarted I really wanted to bring that change.But now nobody watches TV like that. So the young people, or people like me who pretend to be young, watch everything online. Traditional news channels really limit me.How have you dealt with the ugliness and the accusations that were leveled at you during your marriage and after your divorce? Do you have any advice for young women in the media who might experience the same?\n\n\n\nRK: I do what I do because I have two children who look up to me. So if I pick up a cigarette, I\u2019m their role model. They don\u2019t have a father, they don\u2019t have much of an extended-family support network, so whatever I do, they will inevitably pick it up. The same goes for the women who are looking up to me, whether they\u2019re my daughters or other young women who I know are seeking advice. That\u2019s why I came back because I thought, no, this is not on, you can\u2019t bully a woman, it\u2019s not a woman\u2019s fault she\u2019s divorced. Nine out of 10 times it\u2019s blamed on the woman in our culture and if she\u2019s in the media or twice-divorced, God forbid!I say this to girls in person, I say this in interviews, and you can write this down: work hard, put your head down, stay out of politics. I\u2019m rubbish at politics. [Of course,] it\u2019s harder for a younger girl. I come from a privileged background so I know I can sort this person out.But this needs to change. I\u2019ve had to tell boys working for me to keep a four-pace distance from female co-workers. If you\u2019re in an authoritative position and a younger girl is coming to work, try to be supportive. [Our problem is] we have no support for other female colleagues, we actually back stab them. Janaan is ultimately a film about love. Why were you so enthusiastic about this film after everything you\u2019ve been through with your marriage? What\u2019s your own idea of love?RK: I\u2019m a perfectionist. For me, love is very different from how people think about love in our day and age and particularly in Pakistani culture. For us, love is generally superficial. You know, you see the girl, the girl\u2019s good looking and you think \u2018oh I\u2019m in love with this girl\u2019. For me, it\u2019s not that. Love, for me \u2013 and I think maybe it\u2019s nonexistent, maybe in real life it\u2019s nonexistent \u2013 is the Pakhtun love \u2013 without any bars, go the long haul. It\u2019s giving your life, and sacrificing, whatever it takes. So I don\u2019t believe in this love where people will say, \u2018oh I love my husband but I have my separate life\u2019, I don\u2019t get that. If you want a separate life then you might as well be single, I\u2019d be as brutal as that. I feel like love is about complete commitment, complete fidelity. I must say, it seems like in Pakistan it has become acceptable that fidelity is not expected and I don\u2019t mean only physically. If you can\u2019t confide in someone or keep them as your confidante then what is the point of keeping them in an obviously very intimate relationship. So I\u2019m quite an idealist and perfectionist in those areas. A lot of people criticise me for doing this and that but I don\u2019t think it goes against feminism to give so much and also to want your husband to be successful. I don\u2019t see a clash in that. I think if you can support your husband, or the husband can support the wife, then there\u2019s nothing wrong in that.I think both should do it and it shouldn\u2019t be one-sided but there\u2019s nothing wrong with being devoted to whatever your partner is doing. In Pakistan, that is sometimes seen as negative.Published in Dawn, Sunday Magazine, September 4th, 2016\n", "author": "Hamna Zubair", "title": "FirstPerson: Reinventing Reham"}}

The teaching and non-teaching staff gathered outside the university\u2019s administration block carrying placards and banners in their hands. They also shouted slogans against the Sindh government and demanded that it fulfil the promise of issuing the Rs350 million grant for KU for 2015-16, keeping in view the university\u2019s capacity and expenditures.

They protested against the government\u2019s political interference in the autonomy of public-sector universities. The universities also demanded financial assistance to those universities facing financial crises. Kuts president Dr Shakeel Farooqi, who is also the general secretary of Fapuasa, said that due to lack of funds, the university had not been getting their due rights including medical allowance, leave encashment and increment in the salary as per the rules. They had asked the university\u2019s administration to resolve their issues but there has been no outcome yet. KU is bearing a loss of Rs800 million every year on account of salaries because the government only releases salaries for eight months, while the university administration manages the remaining expenditures through tuition fees, he added. Unfortunately, salaries have not been paid since the last two months, he said. Dr Farooqi showed concern that after the 18th amendment the Sindh government failed to protect the rights of university employees.

Stedman\u2019s bestselling novel, this unapologetically weepy, handsomely staged melodrama revolves around an almost superhumanly restrained protagonist, lighthouse keeper and traumatised World War I veteran, Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender).But counterbalancing his character\u2019s chiseled stoicism is a willingness to go for broke \u2014 in the form of garment-rending scenes of loss and separation, and lots of tear-streaked close-ups \u2014 that indicate where the movie\u2019s temperamental heart really lies.As The Light Between Oceans opens, Tom has just fetched up in a coastal Australian town in order to replace the light keeper who\u2019s convalescing, a prologue eerily reminiscent of The Shining, with its intimations of death and madness. But where the tale could easily accommodate the moody conventions of gothic horror, Stedman and Cianfrance instead embrace its fable-like lyricism and dewy-eyed tragedy: in time, Tom takes Isabel (Alicia Vikander) \u2014 a comely, refreshingly direct local girl \u2014 as his wife, and they repair to his little island for an enchanted honeymoon period.But sadness soon descends, when they\u2019re unable to start a biological family. Then, when circumstances conspire to bring a baby into their lives, The Light Between Oceans becomes a fraught, occasionally manipulative conundrum that the author and film-maker desperately try to portray as a genuine moral quandary, when any clear-thinking person can discern folly and selfishness on one hand and the clear, correct path on the other.Cianfrance knows his way around domestic drama \u2014 he wrote and directed the shattering marriage-drama Blue Valentine, with Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. But he\u2019s hemmed in by material that\u2019s not only dubiously equivocating but structurally ungainly, especially when another love story emerges to compete with the idealised portrait of Tom and Isabel\u2019s marital devotion.That second tale is embodied by Rachel Weisz in a performance that\u2019s as honest and touching as Vikander\u2019s is keen{"1281005": {"date": "Updated August 31, 2016", "article": "DHAKA: A wealthy tycoon who was a chief financier for Bangladesh\u2019s largest Islamist party could be executed in days after losing his final appeal on Tuesday against a death sentence from a controversial war crimes tribunal.The Supreme Court rejected Mir Quasem Ali\u2019s last attempt to overturn the death penalty handed down two years ago by the domestic tribunal for murders committed during Bangladesh\u2019s 1971 independence conflict. \u201cNow he has a chance to seek presidential clemency. Or else the verdict could be executed anytime whenever the state wants,\u201d Attorney General Mahbubey Alam told reporters.Five opposition leaders including four leading Islamists have already been executed for war crimes since 2013. They were all hanged just days after their appeals were rejected by the Supreme Court.Their families said they had refused to seek a presidential pardon as they did not want to legitimise the whole trials process.Ali, who became a shipping and real estate tycoon, was convicted in November 2014 of a series of crimes during Bangladesh\u2019s war of independence from Pakistan, including the abduction and murder of a young independence fighter.Tuesday\u2019s decision is considered a major blow for the Jamaat-i-Islami party, which the 63-year-old Ali had helped revive by setting up charities, businesses and trusts linked to it after it was allowed to operate in the late 1970s.His son Mir Ahmed Bin Quasem, who was part of his legal defence team, was allegedly abducted by security forces earlier in August, which critics say was an attempt to sow fear and prevent protests against the imminent execution.Security was tight in Dhaka on Tuesday, even though the party has in recent months eschewed violent protests in reaction to war crimes verdicts and there was no immediate sign of unrest.The war crimes tribunal set up by the government has divided the country, with supporters of Jamaat and the main opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) branding them a sham aimed at eliminating their leaders.The executions and convictions of Jamaat officials plunged Bangladesh into one of its worst crises in 2013 when tens of thousands of Islamist activists clashed with police in protests that left some 500 people dead.The Islamist party, which is banned from contesting elections, called a nationwide strike on Wednesday, calling the charges against Ali \u201cfalse\u201d and \u201cbaseless\u201d and accusing the government of exacting \u201cpolitical vengeance\u201d.TV station shutBefore he was arrested in 2012 on 14 war crimes charges, Ali headed the Diganta Media Corporation, which owns a pro-Jamaat daily and a television station that was shut down in 2013 for stoking religious tensions.Defence lawyers have said the charges against him were baseless. \u201cMir Quasem Ali wasn\u2019t directly involved in war crimes. False witnesses were provided to frame charges against him. The future generation and law experts will scrutinise the verdict whether it was justified,\u201d said Khandker Mahbub Hossain.The court ruling comes a day after a visit to Dhaka by US Secretary of State John Kerry who said the best way to combat extremism was \u201cto live up to the core values of democracy\u201d.Rights groups have criticised the war crimes trials, saying they fall short of international standards and lack any foreign oversight.A group of United Nations human rights experts last week urged Bangladesh to annul Ali\u2019s death sentence and to retry him in compliance with international standards. \u201cInternational law, accepted as binding by Bangladesh, provides that capital punishment may only be imposed following trials that comply with the most stringent requirements of fair trial and due process, or could otherwise be considered an arbitrary execution,\u201d they cautioned.Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina\u2019s government has defended the trials, saying they are needed to heal the wounds of the conflict, which it says left three million people dead.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Bangladesh upholds Islamist tycoon\u2019s death sentence"}}

This is going to be the fourth change of management that the utility has undergone since its privatisation more than a decade ago, and the third change of ownership. The journey the utility has made along the way has been marked with severe crises and occasional confrontations with the management of Pepco and the water and power ministry, and drawn-out wrangling with the finance ministry, as well as with entities belonging to the Sindh government over the settlement of outstanding dues. It has been used as an example of the pitfalls of privatisation in the power sector on some occasions, and as an avatar of its promise on others. The present management deserves credit for bringing the company into profitability after many years of accumulating losses, and investing in the upgrade of its infrastructure. But along the way, a few crucial lessons have also been learned which should play an important role in structuring the sale and the handing over of the enterprise whenever the time comes.Chief amongst these lessons is the fact that being a monopoly power utility serving the country\u2019s largest city, there is a strong and abiding public interest in how it is run. This goes far beyond the recovery-based load-shedding regime that the present management inaugurated a few years ago. There is the matter of the power purchase agreement with the federal government, gas allocations, fuel adjustment surcharges and the roster of items to be considered as passed through in the tariff. In each case, strong public interest is touched upon and for this reason it is crucial that the transaction, if and when it occurs, be as transparent as possible with all opportunities to solicit stakeholder input. The forthcoming determination of a multi-year tariff for K-Electric provides a good opportunity for this. Nepra should ensure that the hearing on the tariff is conducted in Karachi and advertised well in advance.There is a tendency in Pakistan these days to view Chinese investors through a national security lens and see them as deserving of special treatment. This perception should be meticulously kept away from any K-Electric deal, which is not part of CPEC, nor does it merit any special treatment. This is the time for the power regulator to step forward and do its job in safeguarding the public interest, through strong stakeholder input. The multi-year tariff is only part of this obligation. We need to know more about the investment scheme of the new investor, should there be one, as well as the plans it has to reduce distribution losses, even as we ensure that it does not turn its back on the poorer neighbourhoods of the city.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Chinese interest in K-Electric"}}

Mr Burney informed the audience that the World of Google publishing has users, advertisers and publishers and AdSense facilitates publishers earn money in a seamless manner. Anything between 100 and 50,000 dollars could be generated monthly, he added. An introduction to the two monetization products \u2014 Google AdSense and Google AdMob \u2014 followed. The audience was informed that AdSense had more than two million members and AdWords had one million plus members. Through AdSense you can make money, if you\u2019re a YouTube blogger, publisher etc. and only 20 per cent publishers are brought on board by Google as they are stringent about selecting the best, according to the experts. Basically AdSense connects advertisers to users so that users can make money. Leading media organizations like Dawn and Jang are working with Google in this domain. Placing of advertisements on various web content is how bloggers and publishers earn good money. The more traffic on your site, the more revenue you earn.

On the other hand, district officer labour Saeed Dhillon, in a statement, claimed the minimum wage notification had been implemented in the district and he had issued challans to more than a dozen brick kiln owners for not paying workers Rs1,036 per 1,000 bricks. The violators were taken to the court while action was still going on against others. At the hunger strike camp, Muhammad Shabbir and others again blamed the district officer labour for putting pressure on them to accept the wages being paid by the kiln owners. They warned that if any mishap occurred during the hunger strike, Mr Dhillon and district administration would be held responsible. They had earlier alleged that the district labour officer  was supporting the kiln owners. \nLabour officer says minimum wage order being implemented\n\nDLO Saeed Dhillon refuted the allegations against him that he was supporting the brick kiln owners and not taking action against them for violating the minimum wage notification. He said he could not go beyond his authority under the law but he was making all efforts to resolve this issue. He claimed Section 144 CrPC had been imposed for violators. Mr Dhilon further said the representatives of owners had requested the district administration for giving them time for implementation till December; however, the DCO had denied their request and asked them to implement the notification without delay. He said the owners were being persuaded to resolve the issue and added the hunger strike of the workers had no legal grounds in the existing circumstances. Meanwhile, an emergent meeting of District Brick Kiln Owners Association was also held in which the speakers, \nincluding its president Sheikh Amer Fayaz, Ikram Hafeez, Muhammad Ibrahim, Muhammad Yasin and Zeshan Randhawa, said the so-called labour leaders were blackmailing the kiln owners for their vested interests. They claimed kiln owners of Toba were paying the highest wages to their workers in the whole Faisalabad division. They claimed that those holding the hunger strike were not the kiln workers.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "The Newspaper's Correspondent", "title": "Brick kiln workers strike continues"}}

In his budget speech, the tehsil nazim said the devastating flash floods of the last year had left the infrastructure of roads, water supply and irrigation damaged heavily due to which whole of the budget was diverted to rehabilitation of the battered infrastructures.

{"1281195": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "MOSCOW: As in life, so in death: Islam Karimov\u2019s regime was one of the world\u2019s most secretive and opaque for a quarter of a century, and now his apparent demise is equally shrouded in mystery. Uzbekistan\u2019s president, a dictator who was ruthless with his opponents and even locked away his own daughter, is rumoured to have died on Monday, though there has been no official confirmation.On Tuesday, state television ran segments about fruit, vegetables and the upcoming Independence Day celebrations, without mentioning a word about the president\u2019s health.The president\u2019s younger daughter, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva, confirmed rumours of her father\u2019s ill-health on Instagram on Monday, claiming he was in a stable condition in hospital after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage. The Russia-based Fergana news agency, which first broke news of Karimov\u2019s deterioration, announced on Monday evening that the dictator had died that afternoon.On Wednesday, according to an AFP report, she said in an Instagram message that her father was recovering from a brain haemorrhage and thanked well-wishers for their support, saying this was helping her father\u2019s recovery.Daniil Kislov, who runs Fergana, told The Guardian on Tuesday he was \u201c99 per cent sure\u201d that Karimov had died. Other Uzbekistan watchers agreed the leader was dead or at least in such a condition that he would never be able to rule the country again, though details were scarce.Steve Swerdlow, a Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, who has spent many years working on Uzbek cases, said: \u201cWe have no idea what day the initial incident actually happened. Some have said it was Thursday, some said it was Saturday. It\u2019s just like the Karimov regime to be so cowardly and so opaque that they can\u2019t even give us the concrete information. Even in death, Karimov is a wily fox.\u201dAssuming that Karimov is dead, the question of succession now looms large. When the longstanding dictator in neighbouring Turkmenistan died a decade ago, he was swiftly replaced by his former minister of health and dentist, who went about dismantling his predecessor\u2019s personality cult and building his own.Many analysts suspect a plan must have been in place in Uzbekistan given Karimov\u2019s increasing frailness over recent years, but whether or not it is adhered to is another matter.The country is one of the most closed and secretive in the world.Karimov rarely travelled abroad and almost never gave interviews. Few outsiders have insight into the power struggles at play behind closed doors, and diplomats and analysts are waiting to see whether the transition will be smooth or bumpy.Whatever happens, it will be unchartered territory. The country has no experience of living without Karimov, who was the last Soviet party boss when Uzbekistan was still part of the USSR, and has governed since independence in 1991. Uzbeks were due to mark 25 years of independence on Thursday, but the local BBC service reported that the celebrations had been cancelled.Kislov said he had received information from his sources that all key officials had their mobile telephones blocked on Tuesday, possibly to prevent them from organising or discussing potential plots.\u201cWe really don\u2019t know very much. Maybe there was a plan put in place before. Maybe there is a battle going on now. Maybe there are negotiations. There is no information,\u201d he said.Uzbekistan borders Afghanistan and has been seen as strategically vital by both Russia and the west, who were willing to turn a blind eye to Karimov\u2019s human rights abuses in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in return for access to Uzbekistan\u2019s airbases. In 2004 Britain sacked its ambassador to the country, Craig Murray, for speaking out over rights abuses.The next year, Karimov\u2019s security forces gunned down hundreds of unarmed protesters in the town of Andijan , a massacre condemned by international rights groups but never properly investigated.\u201cIt\u2019s the bloodiest event outside of an armed conflict on the territory of the former Soviet Union,\u201d said Swerdlow. \u201cThat day defines Karimov more than anything else. The fact he leaves this world not having to answer for any of that is very sad for the victims.\u201dKarimov has been accused of all manner of rights abuses and torture, and in recent years attention has also focused on his family. Nothing is known about the current whereabouts of his older daughter, Gulnara Karimova. For a long time she was considered a potential successor to her father, and was a highly public figure, launching a fashion brand and a music career under the name Googoosha. She even released a bizarre love duet with G\u00e9rard Depardieu.In 2014 Gulnara\u2019s son, Islam Karimov Jr, who was studying at Oxford Brookes University, told The Guardian he feared for his mother\u2019s life, and revealed an extraordinary feud brewing in the first family. He explained how he and his mother had been kept from visiting his grandfather, the president, by armed guards, and that when they finally did get an audience, there was an almighty showdown involving the president, his wife, and their daughter. Shortly after, Gulnara was placed under house arrest, and nothing is known of her whereabouts since, or even whether she is still alive.\u201cThere are plenty of rumours but no solid facts about Gulnara for two years already,\u201d said Kislov.Details may become clear later in the week, when it will be difficult for the authorities not to mention and explain Karimov\u2019s absence if celebrations go ahead. Gulnara is believed to be out of the running for successor, with most analysts agreeing that the prime minister and the head of the security services are the main centres of power.Deidre Tynan, Central Asia project director at International Crisis Group, said: \u201cIf there is disagreement or conflict between different players, they will try to keep it behind closed doors.

The warning was issued by a two-judge SC bench headed by Justice Dost Mohammad Khan, after Law and Justice Commission Secretary Sarwar Khan \u2013 who has been appointed a focal person of an expert group constituted by the court \u2013 said none of the secretaries he twice invited to meetings turned up. The court had taken up a petition moved by Aasim Sajjad Akhtar, through his counsel Abid Hassan Minto, seeking a declaration that the state is bound by the Constitution to provide evicted katchi abadi residents shelter and other amenities. \nSenior officials\u2019 salaries to be attached if lethargy towards katchi abadi order persists\n\nThe petitioners also expressed concern over the manner in which residents of the I-11 katchi abadi were evicted by the Capital Development Authority (CDA), in an operation conducted on July 30 last year. In an order issued on April 20, the SC tasked the CDA and the federal and provincial governments with developing uniform legislation to devise inexpensive, low-cost housing for the destitute and shelterless. Subsequently, Sarwar Khan was appointed coordinator for facilitating and providing secretarial facilities to the working group, and governments were directed to ensure regular budgetary allocation for the smooth functioning of the group. The court ordered the law officers of all the provinces, and the respective finance directors, to attach the salaries of the officers assigned the task of developing the aforementioned uniform policy, in case any default was committed on their part. The court added that, in addition to their salaries being attached, the officers would also be proceeded against for contempt of court due to their lethargic attitude toward deciding a matter that has been pending for the last year. The court regretted that the CDA and the relevant federal and provincial departments were not interested in deciding the matter once and for all, through a proper policy. The court said this was unacceptable, and it would proceed against such a delinquent attitude of the relevant officers. However, it decided to issue a final warning, and directed the coordinator to convene yet another meeting of the relevant provincial secretaries and senior-most CDA officials \u2013 such as the member planning and housing and survey. It would be the responsibility of the coordinator to intimate, even in chambers, if any government official failed to take interest in the meeting of the expert group, the court said. The court ordered that in the next meeting, the expert group will finalise the fundamental features of the policy to provide low-cost housing facilities through legislation, to those who cannot afford modest housing. This should be done keeping in view areas\u2019 environment and soil condition. The policy should also guard the interest of the state by protecting it from land grabbers, the order said. The court has allowed two months for the formulation of this policy. If nothing is developed, the respective chief secretaries and CDA chairman will personally appear before the court on the next hearing date to explain the attitude towards court orders. The court also directed the CDA and government departments to conduct a comprehensive survey of katchi abadis with the assistance of Survey of Pakistan, Google Maps and other sources, and for which surveyors can also sign a memorandum of understanding with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to permanently register the family trees of those living in katchi abadis. This would also help authorities prevent undue dual benefits to the same family.

Controversies over doping overshadowed the build-up to this year\u2019s Rio Olympics and flared anew as U.S. and Australian competitors branded their Russian and Chinese rivals drug cheats. In the latest move, the IOC disqualified Russian bronze-medalist weightlifter Nadezda Evstyukhina, silver-medalist weightlifter Marina Shainova, and Tatyana Firova, who finished second with teammates in the 4x400m track event. The Russian Federation team was also disqualified from the women\u2019s 4x400m relay. All the sanctioned athletes were ordered to return any medals, pins or diplomas they had won in Beijing. Bronze-medal-winning weightlifter Tigran Martirosyan of Armenia and fellow weightlifters Alexa\u00adndru Dudoglo of Moldova and Intigam Zairov of Azerbaijan were also disqualified, the IOC said in a statement. It called on sports federations to modify the results of the Beijing Games that were affected and consider what other steps they found appropriate.

Uzbekistan\u2019s president, a dictator who was ruthless with his opponents and even locked away his own daughter, is rumoured to have died on Monday, though there has been no official confirmation.On Tuesday, state television ran segments about fruit, vegetables and the upcoming Independence Day celebrations, without mentioning a word about the president\u2019s health.The president\u2019s younger daughter, Lola Karimova-Tillyaeva, confirmed rumours of her father\u2019s ill-health on Instagram on Monday, claiming he was in a stable condition in hospital after suffering a cerebral haemorrhage. The Russia-based Fergana news agency, which first broke news of Karimov\u2019s deterioration, announced on Monday evening that the dictator had died that afternoon.On Wednesday, according to an AFP report, she said in an Instagram message that her father was recovering from a brain haemorrhage and thanked well-wishers for their support, saying this was helping her father\u2019s recovery.Daniil Kislov, who runs Fergana, told The Guardian on Tuesday he was \u201c99 per cent sure\u201d that Karimov had died. Other Uzbekistan watchers agreed the leader was dead or at least in such a condition that he would never be able to rule the country again, though details were scarce.Steve Swerdlow, a Central Asia researcher at Human Rights Watch, who has spent many years working on Uzbek cases, said: \u201cWe have no idea what day the initial incident actually happened. Some have said it was Thursday, some said it was Saturday. It\u2019s just like the Karimov regime to be so cowardly and so opaque that they can\u2019t even give us the concrete information. Even in death, Karimov is a wily fox.\u201dAssuming that Karimov is dead, the question of succession now looms large. When the longstanding dictator in neighbouring Turkmenistan died a decade ago, he was swiftly replaced by his former minister of health and dentist, who went about dismantling his predecessor\u2019s personality cult and building his own.Many analysts suspect a plan must have been in place in Uzbekistan given Karimov\u2019s increasing frailness over recent years, but whether or not it is adhered to is another matter.The country is one of the most closed and secretive in the world.Karimov rarely travelled abroad and almost never gave interviews. Few outsiders have insight into the power struggles at play behind closed doors, and diplomats and analysts are waiting to see whether the transition will be smooth or bumpy.Whatever happens, it will be unchartered territory. The country has no experience of living without Karimov, who was the last Soviet party boss when Uzbekistan was still part of the USSR, and has governed since independence in 1991. Uzbeks were due to mark 25 years of independence on Thursday, but the local BBC service reported that the celebrations had been cancelled.Kislov said he had received information from his sources that all key officials had their mobile telephones blocked on Tuesday, possibly to prevent them from organising or discussing potential plots.\u201cWe really don\u2019t know very much. Maybe there was a plan put in place before. Maybe there is a battle going on now. Maybe there are negotiations. There is no information,\u201d he said.Uzbekistan borders Afghanistan and has been seen as strategically vital by both Russia and the west, who were willing to turn a blind eye to Karimov\u2019s human rights abuses in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in return for access to Uzbekistan\u2019s airbases. In 2004 Britain sacked its ambassador to the country, Craig Murray, for speaking out over rights abuses.The next year, Karimov\u2019s security forces gunned down hundreds of unarmed protesters in the town of Andijan , a massacre condemned by international rights groups but never properly investigated.\u201cIt\u2019s the bloodiest event outside of an armed conflict on the territory of the former Soviet Union,\u201d said Swerdlow. \u201cThat day defines Karimov more than anything else. The fact he leaves this world not having to answer for any of that is very sad for the victims.\u201dKarimov has been accused of all manner of rights abuses and torture, and in recent years attention has also focused on his family. Nothing is known about the current whereabouts of his older daughter, Gulnara Karimova. For a long time she was considered a potential successor to her father, and was a highly public figure, launching a fashion brand and a music career under the name Googoosha. She even released a bizarre love duet with G\u00e9rard Depardieu.In 2014 Gulnara\u2019s son, Islam Karimov Jr, who was studying at Oxford Brookes University, told The Guardian he feared for his mother\u2019s life, and revealed an extraordinary feud brewing in the first family. He explained how he and his mother had been kept from visiting his grandfather, the president, by armed guards, and that when they finally did get an audience, there was an almighty showdown involving the president, his wife, and their daughter. Shortly after, Gulnara was placed under house arrest, and nothing is known of her whereabouts since, or even whether she is still alive.\u201cThere are plenty of rumours but no solid facts about Gulnara for two years already,\u201d said Kislov.Details may become clear later in the week, when it will be difficult for the authorities not to mention and explain Karimov\u2019s absence if celebrations go ahead. Gulnara is believed to be out of the running for successor, with most analysts agreeing that the prime minister and the head of the security services are the main centres of power.Deidre Tynan, Central Asia project director at International Crisis Group, said: \u201cIf there is disagreement or conflict between different players, they will try to keep it behind closed doors. The risks multiply if they are not able to put on a public front of unity.\u201dBy arrangement with The GuardianPublished in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Shaun Walker", "title": "Rumours of Uzbek  president\u2019s death raise questions over succession"}}

JetBlue Flight 386 landed in the central Cuban city of Santa Clara a little before 11am, about an hour after leaving Fort Lauderdale in south-eastern Florida with 150 passengers on board. The first two passengers off the plane carried US and Cuban flags as they descended the stairs onto the tarmac, where they symbolically exchanged the banners in a sign of friendship. The flight was the first of 110 expected daily flights connecting US cities to airports in the Communist-run island, many of them in or near tourism hotspots. Regular air service was severed during the Cold War, and charter flights have been the only air links since. US Secretary of State John Kerry hailed the development. \u201cThe 1st US commercial flight to #Cuba since 1961, just over a year after raising the flag at US Embassy Havana.

The plane was sent off with a water cannon salute, an aviation tradition in which aircraft pass under arcs of water before flying to their destinations for the first time. Mark Gale, director of operations for the airport, said it was one of the \u201cgreat moments in history\u201d, likening it to the moon landing or the fall of the Berlin Wall.

Her elder brother, Nauman, was already awake and she could hear him pack his school bag. Outside, the sun was already glaring down on the tall green trees and the grass rustling in the air on the mountain slopes. She rushed to the bathroom, a tiny space just outside her house with a pit and a tap. She washed her face, came back in, zipped up her school bag and ran to school. She was wearing a bright red shalwar kameez, a dress she had slept in.Even at the tender age of around 14, Ambreen knew what part of her clothing she could not be careless about \u2014 a face-covering niqab that left a small space for her eyes to peer out. The stony path from her home to the paved road went steeply up the mountain. With the ease of someone who has been walking up and down that path for years, she hopped and skipped and ran all the way. Nauman was leading her as the two went past the trees bearing blood-red pomegranate blossoms and parrot-green walnut fruits. Also read: Of law and lore \u2014 Criminalising violence against womenThe government school in her village, Makol, is tucked away, almost invisibly, at the end of a narrow path covered by thick trees. A small peak, jutting out of a mountain, obscures its front gate. Most teachers at the school \u2013 including the principal \u2013 are men, and girls and boys study in the same classrooms. Girls wear niqab so that the men and the boys cannot see their faces.  When Ambreen returned home that day, her mother, Shamim Akhtar, was livid. Why did she not change her bright red clothes before going to school where there were so many men around, she asked her daughter. Ambreen tried to argue that she did not have time to change. Shamim would not hear it. \u201cYou are not going to school again,\u201d she told Ambreen. Shamim took her books away from her and confined her to the house. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tAmbreen\u2019s brother Nauman looks through his notebook  at his house in Makol |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nFarmaan Ali, a teacher at the school, remembers Ambreen as an intelligent girl, a bright student. She could be naughty and easily distracted because she was so young, but she was smart and curious and a good daughter to her mother, he says. After classes, he had often seen her carrying large water containers home for her mother\u2019s cooking and washing. Her obedience, however, did not stop Ambreen from resisting her confinement. She kept protesting. She wanted to go back to her studies. She would often pick up her notebooks and start scribbling in them or she took her brother\u2019s notebook and copied his lessons word for word. She was restless and often received beatings from her mother for talking back and asking to go back to her school. After her protests became too frequent to ignore, Shamim allowed her to go to a nearby madrasa for daily Quran lessons. Also read: Why people get killed over blasphemy in Pakistan?All that happened in 2015. Exactly a year after she had been banished indoors, Ambreen walked back to school. She was careful to keep well behind her brother so as to make sure he did not see her. She was more worried about her mother. Sooner or later, Shamim would find out that Ambreen was missing from home. She quietly walked into her old classroom. It had changed. Other children had moved into it.\n\u201cThe entire Makol came to see the vans but Ambreen\u2019s mother did not,\u201d says Mustafa.\nAfter her arrival at school, a cousin of hers, who also studied there, went to the teacher Ali and asked him not to give Ambreen any books. She is not supposed to be in school, the girl told the teacher. Ali discussed the matter with the principal, Khaliquz Zaman, and they decided to summon Ambreen\u2019s brother, Nauman. They sent her back home with him. An angry Shamim gave Ambreen a serious thrashing but soon everything went back to business as usual. Ambreen helped her mother clean the house before everyone went to bed. Lying in his cot, Nauman could hear Ambreen sob. That was April 29, 2016 \u2014 a moonlit night. Everything outside seemed to be bathed in a heavenly glow. By 11 pm, Shamim and Nauman fell fast asleep. Between midnight and 2 am, some men came in and took Ambreen away. Whether or not her mother knew is not clear. \n \n(function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; \n\t\t\t\t\tjs = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/all.js#xfbml=1\"; \n\t\t\t\t\tfjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs); }(document, \"script\", \"facebook-jssdk\"));\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMubashir Zaidi, Zarrar Khuhro and Alia Chughtai talk to Annie Ali Khan about 'Pakistan's Missing Daughters' on Zara Hat Kay, Dawn News\n\n\n\nZarnab Gul lives on a hilltop in Makol. It was very early that morning when he heard screams. He opened the window of his room and looked out. He saw a big blaze below \u2014 at a place where a dusty shoulder jutted out of the village\u2019s sole paved link with other villages and towns. Such shoulders are common on roads passing through hilly areas and are meant to provide parking space for broken-down vehicles or for travellers to wait for a bus. Gul called his wife and they went to their rooftop to see what was burning along the road outside. They could not make out anything. He shouted loudly to see if whoever was screaming would answer. He heard back nothing but screams. Gul eventually went down to the road. He saw a van on fire. The flames were leaping towards another van parked nearby. Gul knew the owner of the second van \u2013 a twenty-five-year old local driver Ghulam Mustafa. He dialled Mustafa\u2019s cell phone number and asked him to come over. By the time Mustafa reached the spot, the fire had died out but his vehicle was all burnt down.  Also read: The perils of Pakistani migrants heading to EuropeGul and Mustafa went closer to the vans to see their condition. Both froze with horror when they saw that there was a person sitting inside the first van \u2014 burnt to a cinder. The arms and legs of the body, relatively recognisable, suggested it was a girl. The two also spotted a school bag inside the van. \u201cI was surprised that the bag was still intact,\u201d says Mustafa. \u201cNothing could have survived that blaze.\u201d It was dawn by then. Ali, the school teacher, heard an announcement from a local mosque about a dead body lying in a van on the roadside. He walked down the hill from his house and saw a crowd moving in the direction of the van. When he reached the place where the van was parked, he saw the singed body of a young girl tied to a seat. There were notebooks inside a school bag tucked in her hands. Those belonged to Nauman, Ambreen\u2019s brother. The girl in the van, according to her autopsy report, was strangled before she was set on fire. Her hands and legs were also tied with some plastic material to ensure that she did not move out of the van. When the police arrived, they concluded from the notebooks that the dead girl was Ambreen.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe interior of the burnt van |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nWhile everyone rushed to the spot where the body was found, Shamim stayed at home even though she lived only a short walk away. \u201cThe entire Makol came to see the vans but Ambreen\u2019s mother did not,\u201d says Mustafa.Shamim says she did not notice anything unusual when she woke up that morning, except that the door of her single-room house was open. She went out to the bathroom, washed herself, offered her prayers and went back to sleep. She says she heard announcements about the burnt body of a young girl but she did not pay attention. When Nauman was leaving for school at around 7:30 am, Shamim asked him to wake Ambreen. That is when, she claims, they realised that she was missing. Shamim ran out of the house and checked in the bathroom and the thickets close by but Ambreen was nowhere to be found. She went to the neighbours and asked them about her daughter but no one had seen her that morning.Her statement triggers some troubling questions. She was sleeping right next to her daughter in a small room. How could she not know if someone came in and took the girl away? Why did she not notice Ambreen\u2019s absence before her son told her about it?Also read: What it means to be free in PakistanThe police detained Shamim and Nauman and took them to the police station. They were both beaten up. Shamim was slapped and the soles of her feet were struck hard with sticks. \u201cYou can beat me as much as you want,\u201d she cried, \u201cbut I have not killed my daughter. Why would I kill my own flesh and blood?\u201d She was released, along with Nauman, for lack of evidence.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIllustration by Samya Arif\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nShamim\u2019s husband, Riasat Khan \u2013 a small, gaunt old man with a shrunken, bearded face \u2013 is a labourer working in a ship-breaking yard in Gadani, Balochistan. He stays at his workplace, hundreds of kilometres away from Makol, for most part of the year. He was at work when his daughter\u2019s body was found. He reached home a couple of days after Ambreen had died. He says he has no clue what happened to her.   Shamim, younger than her husband and also more articulate and worldly-wise than him, does not like to talk much about her daughter. Instead, she mourns the death of her eldest born, a boy named Waseem, who had died of an unknown cause a few years ago. He was fine one day and then the next day he was bleeding from the mouth, she says. Within hours he was dead.  Shamim has a photo of Waseem. He seems to be in his early teens at the time the photograph was taken. She has no photograph of Ambreen that can enable an interested outsider to know what she looked like. \nThere is a notebook in his hands. Ambreen used to scribble and doodle in it. He is also drawing something \u2014 a mishmash of lines and spirals, like the mystery surrounding his sister\u2019s death.\nIn the sparse room where Ambreen\u2019s family lives, there is almost nothing that suggests that the girl even existed. A small stove next to a low wooden shelf in a corner of the living room-cum-bedroom marks the kitchen area where a few tin containers carrying cooking oil and some spices are lined neatly. Next to them are pots and pans and a couple of trunks with clothes in them. The bright red dress Ambreen wore to school last year could be in one of those trunks, but there is no way of knowing that. Next to the trunks, charpoys are lined against a long wall facing the only opening in the room: its door. Ambreen used to sleep on one of those cots. As Nauman starts talking about Ambreen, his mother looks at him. He is sitting on a charpoy right opposite the door. There is a notebook in his hands. Ambreen used to scribble and doodle in it. He is also drawing something \u2014 a mishmash of lines and spirals, like the mystery surrounding his sister\u2019s death. Makol, located about 10 kilometres from the military\u2019s premier training facilities in Abbottabad district, is a typical settlement in the mountains: houses are scattered, separated by small hills, pathways and tree-lined courtyards. It consists of a few hundred houses. Most of them are built with bricks and mortar and have concrete roofs but a few are mud huts with thatched ceilings \u2013 like the one Ambreen\u2019s family has. In this village lives a rich man: Muhammad Pervaiz. His family owns vast tracts of land and many houses here. He is also the elected chairman of a union council of which Makol is a part, along with a few other villages.Last year, Pervaiz\u2019s young daughter Saima disappeared from home, allegedly with a man she wanted to marry. Her parents looked for her everywhere they could but did not find a clue of her whereabouts. There were rumours in Makol that Ambreen knew where Saima was. She reportedly was the human link through which Saima communicated with the man she loved.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe house of Muhammad Pervaiz, Saima\u2019s father, in Makol |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPervaiz is known to be unhappy about Ambreen\u2019s role in his daughter\u2019s disappearance. He is reported to have convened a council of the elders of the area in his home some time in 2015 where it was allegedly decided to punish Ambreen. It was not a jirga, a tribal judicial council, in the exact tribal sense because those living in Makol are not bound by any tribal affinity (they all come from different castes and working groups) and it had no legal and political legitimacy as the jirgas have in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas. It is still reported to have the sanction of the rich and the influential in and around Makol. Shamim alleges it was Pervaiz who came to her house along with some other men on the night Ambreen disappeared. He took her away to question her about Saima\u2019s disappearance, Shamim says, but she does not have any evidence to substantiate her allegation. Others in the village speculate that she knew all along that Pervaiz was out to get her daughter. That is why she took Ambreen out of school soon after Saima had disappeared and the jirga had taken place, they say. \nSomething she has noticed in many similar cases: That a woman who leads a life of moral laxity always ends up dying in ignominy.\nPervaiz\u2019s wife, Rubina, a housewife reluctant to speak to an outsider, swears by her husband\u2019s innocence. \u201cHe was at home with me on the night of Ambreen\u2019s murder,\u201d she says. She also denies the allegations that the punishment for Ambreen was approved at a jirga held inside her home. \u201cThat was not a jirga. After Saima went missing, a few elders from the community talked to each other inside a closed room. There was no discussion on the subject ever afterwards,\u201d she says. Also read: Why divorce is close to impossible for Christians in PakistanRumours continue to swirl around the case. One of them joins Pervaiz and Shamim as secret lovers who killed Ambreen after she had come to know about them. According to another rumour, Shamim could have killed both Waseem and Ambreen for some unknowable reason.  Many weeks after Ambreen\u2019s murder, Safeer Ahmed, a junior court official in Abbottabad, a few kilometres to the north-west of Makol, insists that Shamim was \u201cinvolved\u201d in some kind of a \u201cracket\u201d and that is why she had her own \u201cdaughter killed to cover up her crime\u201d. Makol is a small place where everyone knows everyone, he says. \u201cIt is not a city. How can the mother not know the person who took her daughter away? There is some great secret here.\u201d\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tWomen clad in burqas walk along a road near Dewal Sharif | Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPervaiz and around 10 others \u2013 including the owner of the van in which the body was found \u2013 were arrested in early May 2016 and are in jail pending a trial. The police are yet to release a complete forensic audit of the crime scene. A judicial inquiry into Ambreen\u2019s death, ordered by the provincial government, is also going on. Whoever killed Ambreen was both meticulous and methodical. According to police investigations and statements of witnesses who discovered her body, the killers had cut off electricity to the nearby street light and damaged the water pipeline passing through the place so that water to extinguish the fire could not be secured easily. Ambreen was dumped on a seat right above the van\u2019s gas tank. When the fire started, she did not burn slowly. The fireball cause by the gas roasted her body instantly. Her teacher, Ali, remembers how many in the crowd that April morning took photos and made videos of the crime scene. Those grainy and terrifying images and the recent renaming of the local school after her are the only signs that Ambreen did once exist. Even her grave in Makol graveyard remains unmarked: a small mound of dried earth with a shapeless piece of rock placed where a tombstone should have been.\n\n\n\nDewal Sharif is like Makol in many ways. Both are located in the same mountain valley that links the tourist resort of Murree in the south to Abbottabad in the north-west through scattered settlements nestled amid forest-covered ravines and snow-capped peaks. But Dewal Sharif is much bigger and, with its own commercial areas and multiple road links with the rest of the country, is more economically developed than Makol. And there are more private schools in Dewal Sharif than there are shops in Makol. Maria Sadaqat, a tall 19-year-old girl, was both a beneficiary and a contributor to this sprawling private education system. Her death on June 1, 2016 is also linked to it \u2014 albeit indirectly. Also read: Enforced disappearances: The plight of Kashmir's 'half widows'Many in this town of more than 10,000 people agree that Maria was a bright girl. Even when she was studying at a local school, she taught other students in her class. By the time she reached the second year of college, there was competition among the owners of private schools to hire her as a teacher. The head teacher at Al Abbas School \u2013 where Maria had done her primary and secondary schooling \u2013 was certain that she was going to teach at his school. Shaukat Abbasi, proprietor of the Suffa School of Modern Studies, believed she would join his institution. He was, after all, a close friend of Maria\u2019s father Sadaqat Abbasi. Sadaqat and Shaukat had become friends some years ago. The former was working as a driver then and the latter as a Grade-17 government officer. They, respectively, came from the relatively poor lower part of Dewal Sharif town and its better off upper part. It was originally a case of a small man trying to be seen as being close to a big man; a way of gaining some social and financial traction in a highly hierarchical society. Then Shaukat gave Sadaqat some money to set up his own chicken coop. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe main road of Dewal Sharif  |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nPerhaps to return his favour, Sadaqat decided that Maria would teach at Shaukat\u2019s school after she passed her intermediate exam. All her younger siblings \u2013 five sisters and a brother \u2013 were also to attend the same school as students. Her colleagues at the school liked Maria but they thought she was a little odd for a girl of her age. Firstly, she was a couple of inches taller than most women around her and then she did not wear any make-up other than an occasional application of kohl to her eyes. The teachers felt \u201cembarrassed standing next to her\u201d, a member of her family recalls. She had one foible though \u2014 she liked spending money on buying watches. One of her watches had a small dial with a long thin leather strap. She wore it on most workdays. The other one looked like a gold bracelet that she paired with pearl earrings. Recently, she had started wearing a delicate gold nose ring that her grandmother had bought for her. These distinctions apart, she wore a black abaya, as did all other teachers working with her, while walking to and from the school. It had a sprinkling of black shiny objects on the shoulders and across the front. And like most teenage girls, she loved bags. Her shoulder bag was made of imitation fur and leather \u2014 a popular design sold everywhere in Murree\u2019s bazaars.Maria was friendly and confident and had the talent for putting people at ease with her conversation. Her friends and family say she always had a story or two to tell. She was obviously an object of envy among her peers. Her father was very proud of her. Maria had brought him prestige in the community and additional cash to his family kitty. Some months after Maria started teaching at Shaukat\u2019s school, Sadaqat developed business problems with her boss. Accounts differ. Sadaqat says Shaukat was his business partner \u2014 they shared profit and loss. When the business was doing well, Shaukat was receiving his share of the profit but when sales and profits were badly hit, he started asking for his money back. Shaukat says he had given the money to Sadaqat as a loan. At first Shaukat did not press his demands much. Sadaqat, in the meanwhile, went to Saudi Arabia on a work visa as a labourer. It was then that the environment started changing for Maria at the school. Rumours began circulating that Shaukat had sent a marriage proposal to Maria for his son \u2014 an already married man with a child who also taught at another private school. Others suggested that Maria and Shaukat\u2019s son were having a secret affair. To avoid the scandal to blow up in her face, she quit her job. Her siblings were also transferred to a different school. [Also read: The evolution of honour killing]17The relationship between Sadaqat and Shaukat was steadily souring all this while, especially after Sadaqat came back from Saudi Arabia, abandoning his contract halfway. Almost penniless, he started a vehicle repair shop in the market area in lower Dewal, where Shaukat appeared regularly, demanding his money back in full view of other people. The two often exchanged hot words. One day in May this year, the two men almost came to blows. But Shaukat backed off, sensing that the much younger and fitter Sadaqat would outdo him easily in a fist fight. Sadaqat, though, believed the quarrel was not over. The next day, he left Dewal to attend a funeral in the nearby town of Phagwari. All the elders of his family and five of his children went with him. Maria was left at home to take care of her special-needs sister, six-year-old Habiba. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe area in front of Maria\u2019s house where she was thrown off a slope after being burnt |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAt 11:45 am that day, Shaukat \u2013 along with four or five other people \u2013 arrived at Maria\u2019s house, a small three-room stand-alone house on a hillock. He called her outside. As soon as Maria opened the gate, the men slapped her and pulled her to a clearing where some goats were tied. They ripped her clothes and beat her in turns, making a circle around her. \u201cYou are stalking my son. Today, I will set you on fire,\u201d Shaukat said to her. The men forced her to the ground. Shaukat took out a plastic container, threw kerosene oil on Maria and set her ablaze. She screamed for help but no one came to her rescue. The men then threw her down a nearby mountain slope. She landed on a path, many feet below. This is how the events of the day transpired, according to the statement that Maria gave to the police from a hospital bed and the accounts of her family. Her neighbour\u2019s son, a 12-year-old, was playing on the rooftop of his house when he heard someone screaming. He rushed to Maria\u2019s house where the screams were coming from. He found her lying on the path, still in flames with her clothes ripped at many places. He called his sister. She gave Maria water to drink and called Sadaqat, who came back home and took Maria to a government hospital in Phagwari.    Also read: Republic of fearThe hospital did not have any facilities to treat burn victims. He eventually shifted her to Pakistan Institute of Medical Sciences (Pims) in Islamabad for treatment. Maria lay there in a bed, fully conscious for 36 hours. She recorded her statement \u2013 an audio and a video \u2013 describing her attackers in detail. On her last day in the hospital, an uncle roughly the same age and with the same white beard as Shaukat, came to see her. She screamed in terror. \u201cMaster Shaukat is here to burn me,\u201d she cried. \u201cBaba, throw him out.\u201dShe died the same day. Seen in her pictures, Maria looks like a younger version of her grandmother, Subeda \u2014 same height, same straight nose, same high cheekbones and same curious brown eyes. Subeda wants the courts to give Shaukat the same punishment he has inflicted on her granddaughter \u2014 death by fire. Maria\u2019s father has the same demand. Sadaqat and his family, however, seem more sad than angry. \u201cFor me, she was a son,\u201d he says. \u201cAll my children are very bright but Maria was exceptionally intelligent.\u201d While the financial dispute between Sadaqat and Shaukat is well known in Dewal Sharif and rumours about the latter\u2019s desire to make Maria his daughter-in-law are widespread, few men outside Maria\u2019s family believe that he killed her. Many of them are willing to vouchsafe for Shaukat\u2019s good character; others remember him as one of the best and the most respected educationists in the area. After the police arrested him and put him behind bars, there were, indeed, public marches in Dewal Sharif in his favour. Many female teachers and students also participated in those. \n\u201cShe is already dead and she has also named me, but as a human being I feel sad over her death,\u201d he says calmly\nMembers of Maria\u2019s family allege that Shaukat was enraged because she had refused to become the second wife of his son. \u201cHe kept threatening her,\u201d says Maria\u2019s aunt Sobia. \u201cIf you don\u2019t marry my son then I will make sure you marry no one else,\u201d she quotes Shaukat as telling her niece.I manage to sneak inside Rawalpindi\u2019s Adiala Jail on June 28, 2016, to have a meeting with Shaukat. We talk in a room full of people where the prisoners stand on one side in a cage-like iron structure and their visitors on the other side, both groups trying to have a conversation through tiny holes in steel sheets separating them.  \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMaria (centre) with her sisters |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nHe looks older than he did in a video of him available online. He also appears withdrawn. He acknowledges his verbal squabble with Sadaqat and also claims that he backed off that day in May in the market so that he could avoid getting hurt. But he denies even being in Dewal Sharif the day Maria was burnt. \u201cI had gone to a village 45 kilometres from Dewal to enquire about an ailing friend.\u201d Shaukat says he came to know about the incident through a phone call. \u201cThen I heard Maria\u2019s father had nominated me and my neighbour for the crime. We ran away initially but surrendered a few days later.\u201d He insists that he never saw Maria after she had left his school. \u201cShe has given her pre-death statement under dictation from her father,\u201d says Shaukat.  Maria\u2019s family members say they kept asking Shaukat to come forward and clear his name while the girl was still alive. He did not do that. \u201cThe media was baying for blood. How could I risk my life by going there?\u201d he responds. Shaukat also denies that he ever asked for Maria\u2019s hand for his son. \u201cI swear I never talked about marrying the two,\u201d he says. As I start to leave, he stops me. \u201cShe is already dead and she has also named me, but as a human being I feel sad over her death,\u201d he says calmly, showing no outward signs of agitation, anger or animosity. \u201cI really feel sorry for her,\u201d he adds. In his online video, apparently made when he was being investigated by the police, he makes a passionate plea about his innocence. \u201cI have a grown-up daughter of my own. Those who have grown-up daughters of their own don\u2019t eye other people\u2019s daughters.\u201d Given Maria\u2019s last statement and the media\u2019s coverage of the incident, it looked unlikely that Shaukat would be released from jail any time soon. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMaria\u2019s personal belongings |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe police investigations, however, soon absolved him of the accusations. A few weeks ago, a committee formed by Punjab Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif to investigate Maria\u2019s death declared that she had \u201ccommitted suicide and was not murdered.\u201d  According to a report published in daily Dawn on July 2, 2016, the \u201ccommittee headed by Deputy Inspector General (DIG) Abubakar Khuda Dad Khan, Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP) Khuda Bux Cheema and Deputy Superintendent of Police (DSP) Ghasud Deen analysed forensic data, obtained polygraph tests, mobile phone records, fingerprints, medical reports, talked to doctors and conducted interviews in order to ascertain the cause of death.\u201d The officers recommended releasing Shaukat and two of his alleged accomplices.They were released on bail soon afterwards.   The police are also said to have leaked Maria\u2019s cell phone data. It showed she was exchanging amorous messages quite regularly with Shaukat\u2019s son. Asma Jahangir, the renowned human rights lawyer and activist, visited Maria\u2019s home as part of a three-member fact-finding mission sent by the Supreme Court Bar Association soon after the incident of her burning. Jahangir has seen her autopsy report and spoken to her family. She has also met Maria\u2019s neighbours who were the first ones to hear her screams. She says she found Dewal Sharif divided along gender lines over Maria\u2019s death. The women were \u201cin full sympathy with the victim whereas the men were either justifying [the] crime or denying it totally,\u201d says the mission led by Jahangir in its recently released report. \u201cThere was a concerted effort to paint the occurrence as a suicide rather than murder,\u201d it adds. \u201cIt was obviously not a suicide. It was murder,\u201d Jahangir says in her office in Lahore. \nThey are straightforward murders, disguised as honour killings to escape punishment\nShe cites Maria\u2019s postmortem report to say that her hands, feet and head were unburnt. This, she says, suggests that more than one person held her down to the ground while she was being set ablaze. The fact-finding mission report quotes one Ejab Abbasi, chairman of union council Dewal Sharif, as saying that he met Maria in hospital twice to probe her thoroughly. \u201cThe victim was absolutely certain and remained consistent about her version of the incident,\u201d he is reported to have told the members of the mission.  Jahangir says she also tried to meet Shaukat\u2019s family but they were unable to meet the mission for unspecified reasons. She clarifies that it was not her mandate to find out who had killed Maria. \u201cMy mission was to ensure that the investigation was carried out independently. There was obviously a lot of prejudice against the girl. I wanted to ensure that the rumours did not sidetrack legal proceedings.\u201d The fact-finding mission initially \u201cwas quite satisfied with the inquiry\u201d but its members were \u201cshocked to know that the investigation had declared the main accused as being innocent\u201d. They also point out that a magistrate hearing the case did not accept the police recommendation to release the accused \u201cand yet bail was granted\u201d to him. The report lists developments that might have had some negative impact on the investigation. \u201cThere was a campaign of character assassination of the victim and her family and \u2026 there were credible reports that the family members were being threatened and induced to accept some reward for their silence.\u201d  Jahangir points to a widespread public perception, especially among men, in Dewal Sharif \u2014 something she has noticed in many similar cases: That a woman who leads a life of moral laxity always ends up dying in ignominy. \n\n\n\nHe passed through her street every day. She waited for him half-hidden behind a half-open door. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you look my way? Why don\u2019t you talk to me?\u201d she gathered the courage to ask him one day. \u201cI have nothing to offer,\u201d he replied. \u201cI want nothing,\u201d she said. Muqaddas Bibi was a young girl with a soft face. \u201cShe was the daughter of a potter but she looked like she belonged to a family of Rajputs,\u201d the boy\u2019s mother says. Taufiq Ahmed is a handsome young man with a thick mustache and thick wavy black hair, oiled and slicked back stylishly. One of his legs is shorter than the other but that is barely noticeable. He works as a tailor. The two lived in the same Buttranwali village, a nondescript settlement a little off the road that connects Gujranwala with Sialkot \u2014 nestled amid green fields being steadily taken over by ramshackle housing and brick kilns. They came from two different castes and their financial status varied. Though the girl\u2019s family was poor a couple of generations ago, they have been doing well of late and are regarded well off by the village\u2019s standards. Ahmed comes from a family of carpenters which struggles to make ends meet even when some of its members have branched into other professions. They had no chance of having an arranged marriage.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaufiq Ahmed |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThree years ago, the two ran away and got married in a court.At first Ahmed\u2019s family was hesitant to accept Muqaddas into its fold but she took to her married life wholeheartedly. \u201cShe made rotis every day for the family, washed clothes and was always helping everyone,\u201d says Ahmed\u2019s mother. Everyone in the family and the neighbourhood soon started liking Muqaddas. An elderly woman living next door to her would come to her complaining of headache and Muqaddas would apply oil to her hair to massage and soothe her. Ahmed lives in a small single-storey home made of red bricks, unplastered and unpainted. It is hard to distinguish from other houses in the village. His entire family has one room to sleep in \u2014 a simple structure with bare walls, save for a couple of framed images of the Kaaba. Ahmed works from 7 am to 11 pm in one corner of the house, making about fifteen thousand rupees a month by stitching clothes. Muqaddas would serve him tea every few hours. \n \u201cOnce women become independent, they also get a mind of their own and want to marry of their own choice. This is seen as a major contravention of family boundaries.\u201d\nAbout a year ago, they had a daughter. A few months after her birth, Muqaddas became pregnant again. She was happy about her second child. The delivery was still two months away but she made new clothes for herself to wear after she had given birth. One day this June, she felt ill and Ahmed\u2019s mother offered to take her to a hospital. They were to take a bus to Gujranwala, slightly more than 10 kilometres away. While Muqaddas and her mother-in-law were waiting at a bus stop, her mother arrived there and grabbed Muqaddas by the hair and the neck. \u201cIt all happened so fast,\u201d says Ahmed\u2019s mother, \u201cthat I did not know what to do.\u201d Before anyone could come to their help, Muqaddas\u2019 mother had dragged her daughter into her house and closed the door from inside.As a crowd gathered outside, the mother screamed at the daughter. \u201cWhy did you marry a cripple?\u201d Other members of the family were also present inside the house and they are known to have beaten up one of Muqaddas\u2019 sister-in-law for trying to help her. Within minutes, the mother took out a knife and slit the daughter\u2019s throat. As Muqaddas lay dying, people waiting outside tried to enter the house but could not. \u201cThey must have planned for a long time,\u201d says a visibly angry Ahmed. \u201cOur women seldom leave the house. They have been waiting for a chance all this time to grab her.\u201d \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMuqaddas Bibi\u2019s husband Taufiq Ahmed with his daughter and mother |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe old woman who liked Muqaddas for oiling her hair curses the girl\u2019s mother. \u201cThe whole neighbourhood is in shock,\u201d she says crying. \u201cThis is not about honour. Once the girl had become a mother, the question of honour died there and then.\u201d Ahmed\u2019s mother now looks after his daughter. \u201cWhat will this little girl think when she grows up?\u201d she asks before she starts crying. \u201cI am going to take good care of our child,\u201d Ahmed says, lifting his daughter in his arms.Muqaddas is buried in a grave behind a wall forming the village\u2019s boundary. There is an empty bottle of camphor and fresh flowers lying on the grave. Back at his home, Ahmed takes out an album carrying the photos of the couple. In one photo, a heart pierced by an arrow overlaps them as they pose for the camera. \u201cI want to ask the world, if love is forbidden then why did God give us a heart,\u201d he says. \u201cIf these people call themselves believers, do they not believe that couples are made in heaven?\u201d\n\n\n\nThe months of May and June this year have been the cruelest. Violence against women has been rampant during this period. In May alone, the national media reported at least five cases in which women were murdered \u2014 in most instances by their close relatives. Zeenat Bibi\u2019s killing stands out among all these cases for multiple reasons. An 18-year-old girl living in a working class neighbourhood in southern Lahore, she was burnt to death on June 8 by her mother, Parveen Rafiq. This is the first known incident this year of a girl torched to death by her own family. Zeenat also did not belong to a village where some supposedly primitive anti-women social code operated. She lived and was killed in the second biggest city in the country where tribal concepts of male honour look distinctly unfeasible to follow. And she was killed by her mother \u2014 not by her brother or father though they may have a role in it. Yet the cause of her death is what it has always been in such cases: \u201cbringing shame to the family,\u201d as her mother put it, according to a report published by daily Dawn. Parveen, who confessed to her crime and is undergoing trial, set Zeenat on fire more than a week after the girl had reportedly eloped with one Hassan Khan. The two had married in court. \u201cHassan had agreed to let his wife return [to her parents\u2019 home] after her family promised ... to organise a traditional wedding reception for the couple,\u201d the newspaper reports.  Less than a week before the girl was murdered, the neighbours had seen her brother carrying home a jerrycan of petrol. The fire that killed Zeenat was so big that it was extinguished only with help from the official rescue service. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tTaufiq Ahmed shows a dress belonging to his wife |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nAmmar Majeed, who works at Jahangir\u2019s law firm, AGHS Associates, as a media officer, has been visiting homes from where violence against women is reported. He has seen cases similar to that of Zeenat\u2019s. In his reckoning, these \u201care crimes of ego\u201d that \u201chave nothing to do with honour.\u201d A mother, upset that her daughter did not listen to her before deciding who to marry, resorts to killing not in order to redeem her honour but to satisfy her pride.  From experience, Majeed knows that such pandering to the self often has a destructive outcome. He once asked a boy why he had killed his sister. \u201cBecause it was satisfying,\u201d is the answer he got. Khawar Mumtaz, a veteran of the women\u2019s rights movement in Pakistan, has worked in different capacities over the last three and a half decades \u2014 first as a member of the Women\u2019s Action Forum (WAF), then as a founding member and head of the Aurat Foundation, a Lahore-based lobbying and research group on women\u2019s rights, and recently as the chairperson of the National Commission on the Status of Women. \u201cMost cases of violence against women in the 1980s were reported from tribal areas in Sindh and Balochistan,\u201d she says. The situation has only worsened over the years as similar cases are being reported from everywhere in the country. One reason, according to Mumtaz, is that the economic, social and political environment is changing in Pakistan. \u201cWomen are doing much better economically, politically and socially as compared to the past,\u201d she says. \u201cWomen are marrying late. More and more women are working.\u201d This, she says, is one of the major factors in the backlash against them. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe graveyard in Butranwali, Punjab where Muqaddas Bibi is buried | Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nMumtaz points to \u201ca total disjuncture\u201d between how the society is moving ahead and how social structures and social roles are still playing out in the same old ways. She gives an example: \u201cOnce women become independent, they also get a mind of their own and want to marry of their own choice. This is seen as a major contravention of family boundaries.\u201d That explains why it has become acceptable that a woman can work to provide for her family but it is still not acceptable if she exercises choice in marriage. \u201cViolence then is likely. It is part of a control mechanism.\u201dShahnaz Rouse, a professor of sociology at the Sarah Lawrence College in the United States, has also written about social and political changes that have led to an increase in violence against women in Pakistan. In her book, Shifting Body Politics: Gender, Nation, State in Pakistan, she sees the crucial shift in attitudes towards women having resulted from the militarisation and progressively increasing masculinisation of society itself since the military regime of General Ziaul Haq. Freely available arms and ammunition and Pakistan\u2019s status as a frontline state during the war in Afghanistan and the drug trade are some of the contributing factors to the social changes she highlights. \u201cThe militarisation of the state and civil society [is] a result of the international/global politics of the last two decades, combined with the collapse of the liberalisation policies of regimes following Zia \u2026 the continued reliance by all three [regimes] on \u201cIslamic\u201d ideology as constructed by increasingly militant and conservative religious groups for \u201cstrategic\u201d and/or ideological purposes, have resulted in an alarming masculinisation of public space.\u201d \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA photo taken in Asma Jahangir's office in Lahore | Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe Other Side of Silence: Voices from the Partition of India by Urvashi Butalia goes another step backwards. Her book deals with one of the most brutal manifestations of the notion of shame and honour being linked to women and their bodies on a mass scale. Women were humiliated by being paraded naked in the streets or forced to abandon their religion and marry their rapists, never to see their families again during the cataclysmic events of 1947. Thousands of them died willingly at the hands of their own men to avoid bringing shame and dishonour to their families.  \u201cThey are straightforward murders, disguised as honour killings to escape punishment,\u201d Butalia said in an interview about some recent incidents of violence against women in India.  The word honour invariably appears in news reports covering violence against women. Maqsooda Solangi, who has been working for the Aurat Foundation for six years, believes that many crimes are seen as honour killings because the media portrays them as such. \u201cNews contents are spiced up,\u201d she says.  The situation is particularly bad at relatively small Punjab-based Urdu language newspapers. Whenever an honour crime occurs, it is covered in a way that focuses on the love marriage aspect of it, Solangi says. She adds that the coverage of crimes against women in local-language newspapers in Sindh is not as salacious as it is in Punjab.  It was during Zia\u2019s era that honour killing first entered the lexicon of the news media and human rights activists, Mumtaz says. It has its origin in a 1979 judgement by the Peshawar High Court that declared that Islamic concepts of qisas (retribution) and diyat (compensation) must be taken into account before deciding any cases involving the death penalty. Awarding capital punishment without any provision for forgiveness is un-Islamic, the court ruled. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tGraffiti  against domestic violence along a road in Abbottabad |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nIn politics, this put Zia\u2019s self-professed Islamist regime in an uncomfortable position as far as hanging \u2013 without provision for forgiveness \u2013 of deposed prime minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was concerned. The verdict also raised alarm among women\u2019s rights activists. It will lead to impunity for those men who kill their women because they can benefit from forgiveness \u2013 which in such cases is the prerogative of their own next of kin \u2013 is how the activists looked at the possible impacts of the law. They were proved right. The next decades saw a spike in crimes against women but most of them did not lead to conviction and punishment. The accused, the police, the prosecutors and even the judges used family honour as an excuse to condone such crimes as crimes of passion,  committed on the spur of the moment by someone incensed by the injury to his or her own honour. This led activists to demand that the state and the courts treat murders in the name of honour as a separate category of crimes in which forgiveness, qisas and diyat did not apply. As a term, \u201chonour killing\u201d thus became a part of everyday language. In March 2015, after multiple failed efforts to reform the law, the Senate, the upper house of the parliament, finally approved a piece of legislation the activists have been asking for all along: honour killing became a crime against the state; the parties to it could not reach an out-of-court settlement in such cases. Women\u2019s murders became \u201cnon-compoundable\u201d \u2014 provided that the prosecution was able to prove that those were honour killings. Tabled by Senator Sughra Imam in 2014, the legislation, however, lapsed because it could not win approval from the National Assembly, the lower house of the parliament, mainly due to opposition from the religious political parties.\n\u201cEvery murder should be seen as a crime against the state, not a matter between two individuals that they can resolve mutually,\u201d\nJahangir believes the focus by activists on the term honour killing has hardly been helpful. Lawyers now spend all their energy and time on proving the crime to be an honour killing, she says. If they can\u2019t do that, she says, the parties to a case can still go and affect a compromise no matter how gruesome the murder.Additionally, qisas and diyat, as Islamic instruments to settle murder disputes, still stay on the statute books. The legal heirs of a victim also have the right to drop the charges at any point during the proceedings. Jahangir blames non-governmental organisations (NGOs) for this state of affairs. \u201cIf they can write in English, they think they can also draft laws,\u201d she says. Their advocacy has only added multiple layers of litigation that women face in courts, she says. Any benefit that could have come about in terms of stricter penalties for honour killing has been apparently cancelled out by these additional legal complexities, Jahangir adds. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tA view of the bazaar in Murree | Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nMany in the NGOs seem to recognise these problems. A report commissioned by a group of women\u2019s rights organisations and development foundations in 2015 attributes major hurdles in justice for women to a number of legal and judicial problems. There are hardly any female judges; availability of a lawyer is as low as 2.5 per 100,000 people and there are not enough female police officers, says the report entitled The Laws of Honour Killing and Rape in Pakistan: Current Status and Future Prospects. The report cites surveys conducted by local human rights organisations that reveal a general lack of faith in the judiciary and very low levels of contact with the courts, especially among women. Most importantly, it points out that the reformed laws have changed nothing on the ground. The lack of sympathy encountered by survivors of rape and other forms of violence against women and the tendency among the police officers to encourage out-of-court settlements seem to have survived despite changes in the law, it says. Nafisa Shah, a long-time campaigner for women\u2019s rights and a member of the National Assembly affiliated to the Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP), readily agrees that the criminal justice system needs reforms. In an interview at her residence inside the parliamentary lodges in Islamabad, she argues that the recent cases of women\u2019s murders are far more complex than they are made out to be. In the past, she explains, the manner of killing women was different. \u201cMost murders were spontaneous acts committed with such weapons as axes or clubs and they usually happened in rural areas,\u201d she says. \u201cNow there seems to be premeditation in these killings.\u201d The existing laws, she says, do not define honour killing in such a way as to cover cold-blooded murders. Shah is soon to publish a book, Honour Unmasked, which contains the results of her own field research on the subject. \n\u201cPatriarchy is violent against women. It is particularly violent against fearless women.\u201d\nShah, as well as Jahangir and Mumtaz, agree that distinguishing one type of crime from the other \u2013 as has been the case with honour killing \u2013 has created more problems than it has solved. Ideally, all three say, all crimes should be treated alike \u2013 investigated, prosecuted and adjudicated in the same manner regardless of the gender, caste, creed, ethnicity and the social status of both the perpetrators and the victims. \u201cEvery murder should be seen as a crime against the state, not a matter between two individuals that they can resolve mutually,\u201d says Mumtaz. Fauzia Azeem was a small-town girl from Punjab\u2019s southern backwaters of district Dera Ghazi Khan. Her father, Muhammad Azeem, was a tenant farmer in his native village of Shah Saddar Deen on the Indus Highway. Fauzia was married off at an early age \u2014 she later said she was less than eighteen at the time. She got a divorce after giving birth to a son. Next, she worked as a salesgirl and as a bus hostess in Multan. In 2013, she made her first media appearance, as a contestant for Pakistan Idol, a music show aired on television \u2014 not as Fauzia Azeem but as Qandeel Baloch. She was rejected in the auditions. She then chose social media platforms to post videos that, her critics said, were bold to the extent of being provocative by Pakistani standards. She dallied online with sports stars, politicians and, finally, with a mullah. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tIllustration by Samya Arif\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nQandeel Baloch developed a mass fan following. Her videos were liked and shared by over 700,000 followers on Facebook and by more than 40,000 people on Twitter. One the night of July 15, 2016, her younger brother, Waseem, and cousin, Haq Nawaz, killed her (exact details of her murder are yet to be fully known). Their reason in a confessional statement: she was bringing dishonour to the family. In the First Information Report her father registered with the police in Multan -- where she was found murdered in her rented house -- he gave multiple motives: \u201cWaseem \u2026 used to stop Fauzia from working in showbiz \u2026 my son Waseem has killed my daughter Qandeel Baloch in the name of honour \u2026 he has done this for money\u2026Waseem has killed Qandeel Baloch on the instigation of my other son Muhammad Aslam Shaheen who is a subedar in the army.\u201d A week after her murder, The Second Floor (T2F), a meeting place for discussions on political, social and cultural issues, organised a panel discussion. Titled Bold Women, Bad Women: How to talk about Qandeel Baloch, the discussion moved from looking at her private and public life, her views on sexuality, independence and feminism and public reactions to her online activities, to the issue of violence against women in general and honour killing in particular. \n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe vehicle in which Ambreen was burnt |  Annie Ali Khan\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nDr Nosheen Ali, who taught sociology at the New York University recently, said at the discussion that a limiting framework of morality divided women into good and bad. We need to ask who has created this divide, she said. \u201cHow is it enforced and who does this benefit?\u201d These questions, she said, take us from \u201ca framework of morality to a framework of patriarchy.\u201d She, then, observed: \u201cPatriarchy is violent against women. It is particularly violent against fearless women.\u201dAbira Ashfaq, a Karachi-based lawyer and another panelist at the discussion, agreed with Nosheen Ali but she added that all murders should be treated just like honour killings are so that people who are killed in the name of ideology or religion also get the justice they deserve. She gave the example of the murder of Zafar Loond, a leftist Seraiki activist living and working in Kot Addu town, less than 100 kilometres from where Qandeel Baloch was killed.He was shot dead outside his house only a day before her murder. It is not clear who killed him. What is known is that, fearing opposition from religious activists, his family did not bury him in his ancestral town of Shadan Loond, which, like Qandeel Baloch\u2019s ancestral village, is also in district Dera Ghazi Khan. There were allegations that he was an Ahmadi.   Loond\u2019s funeral prayers were offered in Dera Ghazi Khan city where he was buried in an unmarked grave.\nAn earlier version of this article was published in the Herald's August 2016 issue.

The warning was issued by a two-judge SC bench headed by Justice Dost Mohammad Khan, after Law and Justice Commission Secretary Sarwar Khan \u2013 who has been appointed a focal person of an expert group constituted by the court \u2013 said none of the secretaries he twice invited to meetings turned up. The court had taken up a petition moved by Aasim Sajjad Akhtar, through his counsel Abid Hassan Minto, seeking a declaration that the state is bound by the Constitution to provide evicted katchi abadi residents shelter and other amenities. \nSenior officials\u2019 salaries to be attached if lethargy towards katchi abadi order persists\n\nThe petitioners also expressed concern over the manner in which residents of the I-11 katchi abadi were evicted by the Capital Development Authority (CDA), in an operation conducted on July 30 last year. In an order issued on April 20, the SC tasked the CDA and the federal and provincial governments with developing uniform legislation to devise inexpensive, low-cost housing for the destitute and shelterless. Subsequently, Sarwar Khan was appointed coordinator for facilitating and providing secretarial facilities to the working group, and governments were directed to ensure regular budgetary allocation for the smooth functioning of the group. The court ordered the law officers of all the provinces, and the respective finance directors, to attach the salaries of the officers assigned the task of developing the aforementioned uniform policy, in case any default was committed on their part. The court added that, in addition to their salaries being attached, the officers would also be proceeded against for contempt of court due to their lethargic attitude toward deciding a matter that has been pending for the last year. The court regretted that the CDA and the relevant federal and provincial departments were not interested in deciding the matter once and for all, through a proper policy. The court said this was unacceptable, and it would proceed against such a delinquent attitude of the relevant officers. However, it decided to issue a final warning, and directed the coordinator to convene yet another meeting of the relevant provincial secretaries and senior-most CDA officials \u2013 such as the member planning and housing and survey. It would be the responsibility of the coordinator to intimate, even in chambers, if any government official failed to take interest in the meeting of the expert group, the court said. The court ordered that in the next meeting, the expert group will finalise the fundamental features of the policy to provide low-cost housing facilities through legislation, to those who cannot afford modest housing. This should be done keeping in view areas\u2019 environment and soil condition. The policy should also guard the interest of the state by protecting it from land grabbers, the order said. The court has allowed two months for the formulation of this policy. If nothing is developed, the respective chief secretaries and CDA chairman will personally appear before the court on the next hearing date to explain the attitude towards court orders. The court also directed the CDA and government departments to conduct a comprehensive survey of katchi abadis with the assistance of Survey of Pakistan, Google Maps and other sources, and for which surveyors can also sign a memorandum of understanding with the National Database and Registration Authority (Nadra) to permanently register the family trees of those living in katchi abadis. This would also help authorities prevent undue dual benefits to the same family. The court also asked the federal and provincial governments to explain why budgetary allocations were not made for the expert group in their respective budgets. The court order will be sent to the principal secretary to the prime minister, the provincial chief secretaries, principal secretaries to all chief ministers, the CDA chairman, the Islamabad mayor, and the secretaries of Cabinet Division, Establishment Division and climate change. Meanwhile, the Aug 26, 2015 stay order restraining the capital administration from demolishing any house in existing katchi abadis will remain in place, the SC said. In case of fresh encroachments, the CDA will submit a report to the court seeking permission to proceed against them.Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Nasir Iqbal", "title": "SC gives CDA two months to formulate low-cost housing policy"}}

They added that Fata, which performed remarkably on polio eradication front during the past two years and cut down its cases to 16 in 2015 from 179 in 2014, was grappling with the issue of displaced children.Sources said that Fata remained polio-free till it reported the first case of the year in July this year with similar history. They said that the affected child had gone to Afghanistan\u2019s Paktika province when operation against Taliban was launched in 2014. \nOfficials believe victim got infected in Afghanistan\n\n\u201cThe new case has created same scenario where authorities in Fata believe that the child stayed in Afghanistan and came here with zero OPV dose and got infection in parts of Afghanistan where militants disallow vaccination,\u201d said sources. They said that polio cases could have been detected in Afghanistan. They said that stool sample from the child was collected on the border crossing point when he was entering Pakistan. Sources said that the new case would be counted in Fata in a nationwide tally ultimately like the previous case. \u201cIt will disappoint our field workers, who have been covering 99 per cent of the one million target children in five years,\u201d they added. North and South Waziristan agencies on Afghanistan border remained thick with militants, who imposed a ban on vaccination in 2012 that left 150,000 children unvaccinated. Taliban decided to ban vaccination in Waziristan after Dr Shakil Afridi, a government servant, was accused of involvement in a fake hepatitis vaccination campaign to help the US to locate Osama bin Laden. Taliban claimed that the US could send their spies in the guise of vaccinators and expose them to drone strikes.There was a complete outbreak, especially in North Waziristan due to non-vaccination till the start of military campaign to evict insurgents and residents were re-located to nearby districts of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa where they were vaccinated repeatedly. The displacement proved a blessing for Fata children, who risked poliomyelitis back home but received complete protection against the crippling vaccine-preventable childhood disease. Authorities have been vaccinating repatriating children at designated points on their way to 36 villages de-notified recently in South Waziristan. They have deployed permanent teams, who carry out door-to-door campaigns. Sources said that a conclusion if the case belonged to Afghanistan or Pakistan was yet to be made, but it had an adverse impact on anti-polio efforts in Fata because both the cases, registered in 2016, were surrounded by the same controversy.The nationwide polio tally is 14 in 2016.However, Dr Ikhtiar Ali, head of expanded programme on immunisation in Fata, told Dawn that they were not concerned about the location of the case but their focus was on vaccinating all children.\u201cWe have employed more vaccinators to ensure that children accompanying mothers to Fata from Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Afghanistan get vaccinated. Only vaccination can end polio. Improvement in security has made it possible to reach all children,\u201d he said. Dr Ikhtiar said that a three-day polio immunisation drive was started on August 29 wherein 3,939 teams took part to immunise 1.03million children in Fata and frontier regions.Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Ashfaq Yusufzai", "title": "Fata authorities refuse to own polio case"}}

{"1281335": {"date": "Updated June 15, 2016", "article": "The Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia is not one pilgrims or foreign tourists normally visit. Set against the Persian Gulf, it is the heart of the kingdom\u2019s oil industry. Unsurprisingly, it is also home to most of its migrant workers whose labour populates this sector.Other than migrant workers, mostly Pakistani, Indian, Sri Lankan or from one or another poor labour-exporting nation, the Eastern Province is also home to the majority of Saudi Arabia\u2019s Shia population. Perhaps because of this diverse mix, the province has also been the place where the government has chosen to launch a programme called \u2018Ehna al-Ahl\u2019 or \u2018We are one family\u2019. According to an article in the Saudi Gazette, this programme, which organises performances in the region\u2019s malls and arranges for the distribution of brochures, is meant to enhance national cohesion and denounce extremism and divisions. The programme is supposed to last throughout the month of Ramazan.It can be safely assumed, however, that the Pakistanis labouring in the Eastern Province are not part of the \u2018one family\u2019 whose cohesion and lack of division is a priority for the kingdom. Among them is Mohammad Ilyas who works as the head of budgeting and finance at a multinational steel company. For several months now, Mr Ilyas has been trying to obtain an exit permit that would enable him to visit Pakistan. As some may remember, a confusing directive by the Saudi government several months ago stated that Pakistani workers living in Saudi Arabia would only be permitted to visit Pakistan once every year. A few weeks later, however, the Saudi government said that the directive had been withdrawn and that Pakistani workers could go back home for visits multiple times as they did in previous years.\nThe issue of Pakistani workers trapped in Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern region deserves the urgent attention of both Islamabad and Riyadh.\n\nThe renewed permission to leave more than once seems only to apply to Pakistanis in certain parts of the kingdom. In the Eastern Province, which includes the areas of Jubail and Dammam, however, things are far more complicated. As per the kingdom\u2019s latest requirements, workers must apply for the entry/exit permit through the computerised system known as muqeem. However, when Mohammad Ilyas and others in the Eastern Province use it to apply for the permit, the system gives them an error message and asks them to visit the passport office in Jubail in person. Both Mr Ilyas and his company representative have visited the passport office numerous times. When Mr Ilyas did so, the people at the passport office told him that he was only permitted to visit Pakistan once a year and that if he could not obtain a permit online, he simply could not go home. To add to the humiliation of denied workers like Mr Ilyas, colleagues of different nationalities, including Indians, have no problem obtaining the multiple exit/re-entry permit via the system and can visit home as many times as they wish.Nor is Mohammad Ilyas alone in this predicament. According to the online forum Life in Saudi Arabia, where numerous overseas Pakistani workers share their issues, many other Pakistanis in the Eastern Province are similarly being denied exit permits to go home. Saudi officials at the passport office either tell them that they must try again online or simply state that no permit will be issued at the office itself. In other cases they are told that they have already visited Pakistan more than once this year and are hence not eligible for an exit permit.On May 5, the embassy of Pakistan in Riyadh took note of the problem. The press release posted on the embassy\u2019s website says: \u201cThe embassy of Pakistan, Riyadh is aware of the fact that some of our nationals face difficulty in obtaining multiple exit/re-entry visa from the passport offices of the Eastern Province of Saudi Arabia. The embassy is in constant contact with the concerned authorities to resolve the matter.\u201d In a previous communication issued on April 16, the embassy has stated that it had brought up the issue in writing and in person with the Saudi authorities concerned and was trying its level best to handle the situation.It is now June 15 and Mohammad Ilyas (who has lived and worked in Saudi Arabia for the past 10 years) and many other Pakistani workers in the Eastern Province continue to be without exit/re-entry permits and are hence unable to leave the kingdom. It is true that the embassy of Pakistan has many issues on its hands. Some weeks ago, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs revealed that over 2,000 Pakistanis are languishing in Saudi jails on various charges. The Pakistani embassy is the only recourse for all of these accused. Add to this the demands of the upcoming Haj season and the ever larger number of pilgrims that wish to travel to Makkah, and you have a small consular staff beset with large problems.Even so, the issue of Pakistani workers trapped in Saudi Arabia\u2019s eastern region is one deserving the urgent attention of both governments. At the Saudi end, the kingdom\u2019s commitment to the principles of justice and fair treatment, particularly in this, the holiest month of the Muslim calendar, means that they should not entrap Pakistani workers in a situation that is akin to enslavement.At the Pakistani end, some honest answers must be demanded on the discrepancy between the \u2018official\u2019 statements given by the Saudi government\u2019s representatives (ones that state that no restriction exists on the multiple exit/re-entry of Pakistani workers) and the reality via which Pakistani workers are being denied exit.It is Ramazan now and soon it will be Eid. Pakistan\u2019s workers \u2014 forced abroad because of the scant sources of employment at home \u2014 should not be permitted to become pawns of a Saudi government that seems to care little about whether or not they can be with their families for the holiday. Workers, it must be remembered, are not slaves chained to their place of employment and must be accorded the very basic right to leave and return.

{"1281345": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "The world\u2019s most widely used app-based instant-messaging service has made a change that is about to affect its one billion users.WhatsApp, which was bought over by social media giant Facebook for $21.8 billion in 2014, is now going to share user information, including phone numbers, contact lists, and status messages with the social networking giant. At the time of its acquisition, WhatsApp had promised users that their privacy would be protected.The company claims this is a positive move as it helps them coordinate better with Facebook, allow businesses of relevance to communicate with users through the social networking website, show users more pertinent advertisements on Facebook and get more accurate friend suggestions.\u201cBy coordinating more with Facebook, we\u2019ll be able to do things like track basic metrics about how often people use our services and better fight spam on WhatsApp,\u201d the company wrote in a blog post. \u201cAnd by connecting your phone number with Facebook\u2019s systems, Facebook can offer better friend suggestions and show you more relevant ads if you have an account with them.\u201dWhatsApp reassured users that end-to-end encryption, which prevents any third party from decoding messages sent on the platform, will remain.Wider net\nThis data-sharing arrangement is not just with Facebook, though. WhatsApp made it clear that user information may be shared with the Facebook \u201cfamily\u201d of companies, which could include other acquisitions such as photo-sharing app Instagram or virtual reality company Oculus Rift.Facebook has been making strides in the instant messaging space with its own app-based messenger that no longer requires you to even have a Facebook account. The data from WhatsApp could help the social media giant further monitor user preferences. Facebook already features targeted advertisements based on users' search behaviour. It can track their locations and let them know who on their friends' list are nearby.The main beneficiaries of this will be companies that advertise on Facebook, even as WhatsApp said it is planning to test the feasibility of allowing businesses to send messages to their customers directly on its platform.\u201cYou may receive flight status information for upcoming travel, a receipt for something you purchased, or a notification when a delivery will be made,\u201d WhatsApp wrote in the FAQ section of its site. \u201cMessages you may receive containing marketing could include an offer for something that might interest you.\u201dHowever, the company maintains that it does not like \u201cspammy\u201d advertising, so it will not feature banner ads. Moreover, user messages, photos and other media shared on the app remain safely encrypted, WhatsApp claimed, and said it is only sharing some information with Facebook.Not much of a choice\nThose who do not like these changes can either stop using the app or opt out within the next 30 days.However, opting out will not mean that your information remains entirely private. As WhatsApp said on its website, \u201cThe Facebook family of companies will still receive and use this information for other purposes such as improving infrastructure and delivery systems, understanding how our services or theirs are used, securing systems, and fighting spam, abuse, or infringement activities.\u201dEffectively, the opt-out feature may only stop targeted advertising on users' feed while Facebook can still continue to access other details, such as usage data.Facebook recently posted impressive gains owing to a soar in ad sales \u2013 its advertising revenue jumped 57 per cent in the first quarter of the year to $5.2bn (up from $3.3bn). Market experts have said the company\u2019s stock price has the potential to make a 20pc jump over the next year owing to rising advertising revenues on its properties such as Instagram \u2013 and potentially, WhatsApp.Privacy concerns over WhatsApp use are not new \u2013 even though the company, in a welcome move, had introduced end-to-end encryption earlier this year.There have been multiple hacking attacks on the platform since it was founded in 2009. Moreover, a Dutch University student developed a tool to prove that anyone\u2019s personal information, including their profile picture, status messages and last-seen information (when they were last online on the app) could be accessed through WhatsApp, irrespective of what privacy settings they had chosen, because of a security flaw in the messaging service.The latest decision to share information with Facebook puts into perspective just how much the social media giant is trying to learn about its current and potential users. There are also fears that despite all its assurances, WhatsApp will end up enabling spam with the introduction of marketing messages.No way out\nWhile the announcement has created a predictable amount of uproar regarding privacy concerns, WhatsApp is not the first app to be accessing or giving out information about you and it certainly is not the only one.Internet giant Google has been hit with pretty much the same kind of allegations as Facebook: of collecting and storing data about its users through multiple platforms, including Gmail, Hangouts and other services, to offer better advertising to companies on its search engine. The only difference is that it does not advertise on social media platform \u2013 yet.Similarly, many other communication apps, including Viber, Skype, Instagram and Snapchat, request permission to access a range of information \u2013 such as location, text messages, video and audio \u2013 at the time of installation, which theoretically allows them to collect a host of data from users\u2019 phones.Google\u2019s Hangouts, an instant-messaging service, now integrates with users' offline SMS inbox, as does Facebook Messenger.While there are alternative messaging apps such as Telegram that claim to be more secure and less invasive (though there are reports to the contrary) than Facebook and WhatsApp, the truth is that internet pretty much knows everything about users. Just visit this Google dashboard that serves a nugget of what the search engine giant has learned about you. You can view your search and location history stored by the search giant here and here to see what your advertising profile looks like.And now, WhatsApp\u2019s move to share information with Facebook comes with an additional share of security and privacy concerns. Users are now wondering how exactly the social networking platform will non-intrusively monetise a platform that once emphatically stated that it will not do advertising and said in a blog post in June 2012:\u201cThese days companies know literally everything about you, your friends, your interests, and they use it all to sell ads...\u201cRemember, when advertising is involved you the user are the product.\u201dThis piece originally appeared on Scroll.in and has been reproduced with permission. \n", "author": "Mayank Jain", "title": "WhatsApp will use your data to target ads at you \u2500 but everything else on your phone is doing so too"}}

{"1281385": {"date": "September 04, 2016", "article": "Everyone\u2019s interested in Reham Khan\u2019s business, which might be why the former TV host has tread carefully these past few months. The result? Reham\u2019s regular presence on billboards promoting her talk show Tabdeeli has been quietly replaced by her perennially active Twitter feed and stories about her personal life that graced tabloids in Britain have tapered off. But this month Reham will find herself in the spotlight again, and for very different reasons. She\u2019s one of the producers behind upcoming film Janaan, starring Armeena Rana Khan, Bilal Ashraf and Ali Rehman Khan, and is reinventing herself as a devoted patron of the arts. \u201cIn the Pakistani entertainment industry it\u2019s very, very difficult to get your foot in the door if you don\u2019t have a network in Karachi or Lahore or in the film circle,\u201d says Reham during our chat. \u201cSo I try to facilitate anyone under 30 if they want to improve their skills. I tend to mentor young people in the creative arts anyway, because I did that for the BBC for five years.\u201dIn a sense, Reham\u2019s sympathy for young talent others might deem the underdog is congruent with her recent brush with fame and the media. Both during and after her brief 2015 marriage to PTI Chairman Imran Khan, Reham was dismissed as, at best, \u201ca weather girl,\u201d and at worst, a threat to her spouse\u2019s political future.\nReham Khan is recasting herself as patron of the arts and the youth. She opens up about Pakistani cinema, dealing with abuse ... and love.\n\nSo why has she decided to plunge back into public life, that too through a medium with which she has little experience? In this candid exchange, Reham minces no words as she talks about present-day Pakistani cinema, being a role model \u2013 and love.What prompted you to get involved with producing Janaan, a film that focuses on Pakhtun culture?Reham Khan: Janaan is very much a romantic comedy. It\u2019s light, fluffy and doesn\u2019t pretend to be anything serious. It\u2019s a contemporary film, a story from our own families, such as what happens when a modern Pakhtun wants to marry a Punjabi. But we have addressed our genuine problems as well, such as the Punjabi-Pakhtun rift. I\u2019m Swati. [In film], I think we should promote communities that we know and understand and that haven\u2019t been promoted. The Pakhtun voice has disappeared. The piecemeal offering in dramas is a stereotypical character, with the Chitrali topi atop the head, weapon in hand. I felt very strongly that this is not the Pakhtun culture I know and love.How is Janaan different from other, recently released Pakistani films?RK: One of the things my family found very objectionable [in recent films] \u2013 mind you, we\u2019re from abroad \u2013 was language that was objectionable for family viewing. Two films we watched featured open swearing in Urdu and English and then innuendos, which made it very uncomfortable for us. Not just because they were sexual innuendos, in a very cheap way, but because they contained a lot of misogynistic messages.For me, film is a responsibility. For example, if we\u2019re teaching people that they can cheat on their wives in Bangkok... Although you might have a moral at the end of the story, you\u2019ll have people actually pick up these messages from films.\n\u201cI\u2019m a film buff. I don\u2019t watch much TV, but I watch a lot of films in the cinema and it frustrated me to go and see poorly made films coming out of Pakistan.\u201d\n\nApart from cliches about Pakhtun culture, what other stereotypes does the film break?RK: Well, in Janaan the protagonists are all women. So the chunkier, meatier role is leading lady Armeena\u2019s. She is the one who precipitates things, she is the catalyst in the film. Likewise, the dadi, the phupi, the second leading ladies in the subplot, they\u2019re all very strong characters.Who financed Janaan?RK: Contrary to what has been said about the film, it was the finance that we struggled with. Investors feel film is a very risky venture, and it is, but somebody has to do it. See, I\u2019ve taken a major risk by giving the film my name since I have given these boys a lot of independence. It\u2019s important that they learn from their mistakes and they learn to work independently. Finance was a big issue.In the end we didn\u2019t get financed from Pakistan, we got better finances from a British-Asian route, because they take risks more than Pakistanis. Apart from finances, what was the most difficult aspect of making Janaan?\n\n\n\nRK: We faced a lot of problems. Children here have done an MA or BA but they can\u2019t write a decent email or CV. I used to work for news channels and they go for cheap labour \u2013 but a cameraman paid 8,000 rupees will only do 8,000 rupees worth of work. If you don\u2019t spend on skilled labour, your own quality [of work] will suffer. The government has to support these projects. If it supports [films] then the corporates will also support them. Initially, the government should support the industry through tax exemptions. Of course it\u2019s a big risk but there needs to be some sort of [financial] attraction to come into this. PTV has lots of space which should be used. There is a PTV Academy, which is empty. It\u2019s a big, huge resource which is empty.You\u2019re a journalist by profession, why did you decide to go into film?RK: Personally, my daily routine is journalism.But people don\u2019t read books anymore, people don\u2019t even listen to the local mullah anymore, the message that you want to convey will be conveyed through the media. And of course, the bigger the medium, the bigger the message, the more emphatic the message.When you walk into the cinema you have to switch your phones off, you get involved with the big screen, you cry with the film, you laugh with the film. It actually drives the message home far stronger than when you quickly see it on your phone. If you look at things in international terms, a lot of the way we think is because of Hollywood, [or] because of Bollywood.So these conversations are very important.And I have always been fascinated by films. I\u2019m a film buff. I don\u2019t watch much TV, but I watch a lot of films in the cinema and I think in Pakistan there has been a lack of this, which just annoyed me. It frustrated me to go and see poorly-made films coming out of Pakistan. Is that also why your own show went off the air? Was it not able to maintain the standards that you wanted?RK: I\u2019ve always been very careful and with journalism it\u2019s not a good idea to take a break. But of course, I got married [to a politician] and I couldn\u2019t work on TV. When I restarted I really wanted to bring that change.But now nobody watches TV like that. So the young people, or people like me who pretend to be young, watch everything online. Traditional news channels really limit me.How have you dealt with the ugliness and the accusations that were leveled at you during your marriage and after your divorce? Do you have any advice for young women in the media who might experience the same?\n\n\n\nRK: I do what I do because I have two children who look up to me. So if I pick up a cigarette, I\u2019m their role model. They don\u2019t have a father, they don\u2019t have much of an extended-family support network, so whatever I do, they will inevitably pick it up. The same goes for the women who are looking up to me, whether they\u2019re my daughters or other young women who I know are seeking advice. That\u2019s why I came back because I thought, no, this is not on, you can\u2019t bully a woman, it\u2019s not a woman\u2019s fault she\u2019s divorced. Nine out of 10 times it\u2019s blamed on the woman in our culture and if she\u2019s in the media or twice-divorced, God forbid!I say this to girls in person, I say this in interviews, and you can write this down: work hard, put your head down, stay out of politics. I\u2019m rubbish at politics. [Of course,] it\u2019s harder for a younger girl. I come from a privileged background so I know I can sort this person out.But this needs to change. I\u2019ve had to tell boys working for me to keep a four-pace distance from female co-workers. If you\u2019re in an authoritative position and a younger girl is coming to work, try to be supportive. [Our problem is] we have no support for other female colleagues, we actually back stab them. Janaan is ultimately a film about love. Why were you so enthusiastic about this film after everything you\u2019ve been through with your marriage? What\u2019s your own idea of love?RK: I\u2019m a perfectionist. For me, love is very different from how people think about love in our day and age and particularly in Pakistani culture. For us, love is generally superficial. You know, you see the girl, the girl\u2019s good looking and you think \u2018oh I\u2019m in love with this girl\u2019. For me, it\u2019s not that. Love, for me \u2013 and I think maybe it\u2019s nonexistent, maybe in real life it\u2019s nonexistent \u2013 is the Pakhtun love \u2013 without any bars, go the long haul. It\u2019s giving your life, and sacrificing, whatever it takes. So I don\u2019t believe in this love where people will say, \u2018oh I love my husband but I have my separate life\u2019, I don\u2019t get that. If you want a separate life then you might as well be single, I\u2019d be as brutal as that. I feel like love is about complete commitment, complete fidelity. I must say, it seems like in Pakistan it has become acceptable that fidelity is not expected and I don\u2019t mean only physically. If you can\u2019t confide in someone or keep them as your confidante then what is the point of keeping them in an obviously very intimate relationship. So I\u2019m quite an idealist and perfectionist in those areas. A lot of people criticise me for doing this and that but I don\u2019t think it goes against feminism to give so much and also to want your husband to be successful. I don\u2019t see a clash in that. I think if you can support your husband, or the husband can support the wife, then there\u2019s nothing wrong in that.I think both should do it and it shouldn\u2019t be one-sided but there\u2019s nothing wrong with being devoted to whatever your partner is doing. In Pakistan, that is sometimes seen as negative.Published in Dawn, Sunday Magazine, September 4th, 2016\n", "author": "Hamna Zubair", "title": "FirstPerson: Reinventing Reham"}}

They protested against the government\u2019s political interference in the autonomy of public-sector universities. The universities also demanded financial assistance to those universities facing financial crises. Kuts president Dr Shakeel Farooqi, who is also the general secretary of Fapuasa, said that due to lack of funds, the university had not been getting their due rights including medical allowance, leave encashment and increment in the salary as per the rules. They had asked the university\u2019s administration to resolve their issues but there has been no outcome yet.

The index went down by 0.3pc in August as compared to the increase of 1.3pc in the previous month and 0.2pc in August 2015.The government has projected the annual inflation target at 6pc for the current fiscal year. Average annual inflation was 2.86pc a year earlier.The food group, which has a weight of 37pc in the CPI basket, showed an increase of 3.4pc in August on a year-on-year basis on the back of rise in prices of perishable and non-perishable food items.On a month-on-month basis, food inflation fell by 0.9pc in August due to a 6.5pc decline in prices of perishable products.The food items whose prices increased included eggs (8.01pc), sugar (6.62pc), potatoes (4.24pc), pulse gram (2.6pc), gur (2.55pc), gram whole (1.63pc), besan (1.54pc), wheat (1.41pc) and rice (1.02pc).Core inflation, measured by excluding volatile food and energy prices, was recorded at 4.6pc in August, slightly up from the previous month. This inflation has remained subdued since November last year because of a tighter monetary policy and reduction in food and fuel prices.Government borrowing is one of the key factors influencing the trend of inflation as there is a positive relation between government borrowing and core inflation.Non-food inflation was recorded at 3.7pc in August. This inflation has stagnated in the last four months as oil prices remained steady.Among the non-food groups, education and health indices increased by 7.62pc and 5.82pc in August compared to \nthe same month of the last year.

Stedman\u2019s bestselling novel, this unapologetically weepy, handsomely staged melodrama revolves around an almost superhumanly restrained protagonist, lighthouse keeper and traumatised World War I veteran, Tom Sherbourne (Michael Fassbender).But counterbalancing his character\u2019s chiseled stoicism is a willingness to go for broke \u2014 in the form of garment-rending scenes of loss and separation, and lots of tear-streaked close-ups \u2014 that indicate where the movie\u2019s temperamental heart really lies.As The Light Between Oceans opens, Tom has just fetched up in a coastal Australian town in order to replace the light keeper who\u2019s convalescing, a prologue eerily reminiscent of The Shining, with its intimations of death and madness. But where the tale could easily accommodate the moody conventions of gothic horror, Stedman and Cianfrance instead embrace its fable-like lyricism and dewy-eyed tragedy: in time, Tom takes Isabel (Alicia Vikander) \u2014 a comely, refreshingly direct local girl \u2014 as his wife, and they repair to his little island for an enchanted honeymoon period.But sadness soon descends, when they\u2019re unable to start a biological family. Then, when circumstances conspire to bring a baby into their lives, The Light Between Oceans becomes a fraught, occasionally manipulative conundrum that the author and film-maker desperately try to portray as a genuine moral quandary, when any clear-thinking person can discern folly and selfishness on one hand and the clear, correct path on the other.Cianfrance knows his way around domestic drama \u2014 he wrote and directed the shattering marriage-drama Blue Valentine, with Ryan Gosling and Michelle Williams. But he\u2019s hemmed in by material that\u2019s not only dubiously equivocating but structurally ungainly, especially when another love story emerges to compete with the idealised portrait of Tom and Isabel\u2019s marital devotion.That second tale is embodied by Rachel Weisz in a performance that\u2019s as honest and touching as Vikander\u2019s is keening and hysterical (especially in an unfortunate scene that forces her to scream, \u201cDon\u2019t take my baby!\u201d). At just over two hours, The Light Between Oceans feels lugubrious and too long, but also oddly perfunctory, especially when it comes to Weisz\u2019s storyline and the character who emerges as the film\u2019s unlikely moral center.Filmed in Australia and New Zealand with lots of beautiful shots of water, sky and grassy headlands, and featuring a marvellous score by Alexandre Desplat, The Light Between Oceans has obviously been filmed with good taste and exacting care \u2014 right down to the wonderful infant and child actors Cianfrance found to play a foundling who becomes the object of desire and harrowing, overwrought self-sacrifice.And, let\u2019s face it, there\u2019s very little not to recommend staring at Fassbender\u2019s limpid blue eyes and square jaw for a couple of hours during the dog days of summer. Nominally, The Light Between Oceans refers to the beacon\u2019s location at the geographic point where the Indian and Pacific meet, but it could just as easily be a hint at the salty tears it\u2019s been so carefully manufactured to induce. Ladies and gentlemen, let your hankies unfurl.\u2014By arrangement with The Washington PostPublished in Dawn, September 2nd, 2016\n", "author": "Ann Hornaday", "title": "Fassbender, Vikander take their relationship to a post-World War I lighthouse"}}

The young Ahmad has the same deep brown eyes as his father, whose portrait \u2014 by turns pensive, serious, laughing \u2014 adorns every wall, shop, corner of every road in the valley he held undefeated.Dubbed the \u201cLion of Panjshir\u201d, Massoud the elder was commander of a mujahideen force that battered one of the world\u2019s two superpowers into submission, and later of the Northern Alliance formed to fight the Taliban. He is a national hero, though memories of him in Kabul are tainted by destruction in the capital during the civil war of the 1990s.But in the famed Panjshir Valley, three hours north of the city, devotion is without nuance.Massoud was killed on Sept 9, 2001, by two fake reporters sent by Al Qaeda, the terrorist organisation\u2019s gift to its hosts in Afghanistan, the Taliban. It was just two days before its attacks on the United States.Fifteen years on Ahmad recounts his father\u2019s last days to AFP, surrounded by flowers in the family\u2019s garden, their brightness set off by the camel-coloured mountains of the valley.Coming face to face with his father\u2019s body was a profound shock for a child who, despite war\u2019s devastation, had never seen a corpse before. \u201cEverything changed,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom that moment I realised I had to change everything I learned so far, and at the age of 12 I had to be another person.\u201d Devoted to Afghanistan All of Panjshir attended the commander\u2019s funeral amid chaos: by then the 9/11 attacks had taken place, and Afghanistan \u2014 still under Taliban rule \u2014 knew it would be war.When Ahmad appeared, crowds surged behind him. The child walked with his head down, his hands clasped behind his back, as his father had done. His clear voice moved mourners to tears as he echoed Massoud\u2019s call for independence.It was not until years later that he understood the true burden of his inheritance. \u201cI was in love with astronomy,\u201d he said. \u201cI was full of energy, I was on fire.\u201d But one of his father\u2019s friends told him: \u201cWe expect you to work on a solution for the Afghan people, and I don\u2019t think you will find it on another planet.\u201d His passion doused, he made instead for London, King\u2019s College to study international relations. Now 27, Ahmad is set to complete his schooling and return home.It was all for Afghanistan, he says. \u201cI studied to come back. I have no dual nationalities, I have no property outside Afghanistan, I have nothing ... I am completely devoted.\u201d Afghanistan in 2016 remains insecure. \u201cThis government has kept none of its promises,\u201d Ahmad says.Facing a resurgent Taliban, Washington renewed its military commitments to Kabul in June, and Ahmad expressed his gratitude for international support even as he remained critical of US policies. \u201cWith the campaign of Iraq, they completely overlooked Afghanistan and they allowed a false shepherd ... to be in charge,\u201d he says, resulting in the mess of today.He refused to name names. But the criticism appeared to target both current president Ashraf Ghani \u2014 who shares power in a fragile agreement negotiated by the US with Massoud\u2019s ally, Abdullah Abdullah \u2014 and Ghani\u2019s predecessor, Hamid Karzai.\u2018They hijacked Islam\u2019 Much of the pathos surrounding Ahmad Shah Massoud includes speculation about how Afghanistan would look today had he lived. \u201cHe did not want anyone to intervene in Afghanistan,\u201d Ahmad says.His father warned the world about Bin Laden, he says, referring to a speech Massoud made to the European Parliament in the spring of 2001 calling for support for Afghanistan \u201cto stand against this\u201d.But the world did not listen, Ahmed says, and after 9/11 it was too late.Fifteen years have passed, with billions of dollars spent, and thousands killed. Ahmad brands it all a \u201cwaste\u201d. \u201cThey killed my father in the name of Islam ... They did not care that my father was a Muslim,\u201d he says. \u201cThey ... just hijacked Islam \u2014 they do not believe or understand Islam. And I can strongly say, they are not Muslim. They are simply terrorists.\u201d So does he see himself taking up a political role on the national stage \u2014 MP, minister, president \u2014 as did his warrior father, who was defence minister after driving the Soviets out? \u201cWhy not,\u201d he says \u2014 if it is the will of the people. If not, \u201cI become a teacher.\u201d At his father\u2019s tomb, perched above the valley near rusting Soviet tanks, Ahmad greets the children of admirers and poses for selfies.

But the threat is not over yet, as their presence in neighbouring Afghan\u00adistan is still [something] we are worried about,\u201d he remarked, referring to the IS by its more popular Arabic acronym.Lt Gen Bajwa said Daesh was still operating in some parts of eastern Afghanistan and could still try to make ingress into Pakistan.Explaining the evolution of Daesh, he recalled that in Jan 2015, six Tehreek-i-Taliban Pakistan (TTP) leaders based in Afghanistan\u2019s Nangarhar province had released a video pledging allegiance to the Middle-Eastern terrorist outfit. In the video, \u2018commander\u2019 Hafiz Saeed Khan was nominated as their leader.Daesh-affiliated organisations in Pakistan, he said, were led by Hafiz Umar and consisted of about two dozen people. He said one wing was responsible for planning terrorist activities with a network of educated and well-off individuals, while another wing was overseeing militant operations through local criminals and terrorist groups.According to Lt Gen Bajwa, Hafiz Umar, the Daesh mastermind in Pakistan, had killed 15 law enforcement personnel and was also involved in attacks on two private TV channels in Faisalabad towards the end of 2015.Ali Rehman, a top-tier Daesh commander and ideologue in Pakistan, had killed 14 law enforcement personnel and was named as Sabeen Mahmud\u2019s target killer.The ISPR chief also gave a detailed Powerpoint presentation on the various Daesh operatives involved in terrorist attacks on TV channels in different parts of the country.Talking about preventive measures, he said that proper gates will be installed at all 18 major crossings between Pakistan and Afghanistan to ensure that only those with valid documents could come and go through there. He said hundreds of new posts will be established and new wings of the Frontier Corps will be raised for efficient border management.When asked to comment on US Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s recent remarks in India, who had urged Islamabad to push harder against militants hiding within its borders, Lt Gen Bajwa said that Operation Zarb-i-Azb was indiscriminate and against terrorists of all hues and colours. \u201cWe have no favourites,\u201d he said, rejecting the dichotomy of \u2018good\u2019 and \u2018bad\u2019 Taliban.He highlighted that Pakistan had suffered a cumulative loss of $106.98 billion in the war on terror between 2001 and 2015. \u201cWe are not doing it for anyone but ourselves,\u201d he stressed.In response to another question about the demand for a Rangers-led operation in Punjab, he disclosed that a gang of terrorists has been busted in Faisalabad on Thursday morning, adding that two of the men were high-value targets.He said 3,500 terrorists had been eliminated during the course of Operation Zarb-i-Azb, while 2,272 soldiers were and 537 personnel had embraced martyrdom, including 18 officers, 35 junior commissioned officers and 484 soldiers.He said that they had recovered enough explosives and ammunition from terrorists during the Khyber operation to carry out terrorist activities every day for the next 21 years.Saying that terrorism was rampant in the country before Operation Zarb-i-Azb was launched, the ISPR chief said that North Waziristan was an epicentre of terrorism and nobody could have imagined entering it. However, the forces had now completely cleared the area and moved on to the Khyber Agency, where terrorists were settled.\u201cGiven the rough terrain of North Waziristan, it was a challenging task to carry out the operation, yet the armed forces were successful in clearing out all terrorist hideouts, caves and tunnels,\u201d he said, adding that Khyber was worse.He claimed that Shawal was \u201clike Switzerland now\u201d.\u201cResidents of the area are gradually returning, but they want the army to stay and provide stability and security to help locals revive the economy. Shawal is known for its chilghozas (pine nuts), which he claimed the terrorists were selling to fund their activities.Talking about the Karachi operation, he said Rangers personnel were laying down their lives to ensure peace in the city; 30 Rangers personnel have been killed in the operation so far, while another 89 sustained injuries.He said that since the launch of the operation, terrorist incidents in Karachi had declined by 74pc, while target killings, extortion and kidnappings witnessed a decline of 94pc, 95pc and 89pc, respectively. Around 848 target killers were apprehended, 447 criminals killed and another 233 nabbed during the operation, he said.Published in Dawn, September 2nd, 2016\n", "author": "Iftikhar A.
