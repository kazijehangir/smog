Organisers have been pushing for a unilateral ceasefire before the UN-backed talks. But those hopes have been shattered by renewed outbreaks of fighting, negotiators from both the rebels and the government. Several rebel groups have failed to down their weapons \u2014 a precondition demanded by the military for them to attend \u2014 and troops remain locked in combat with ethnic fighters.UN chief Ban Ki-Moon described the conference as \u201can important first step\u201d toward peace at a press conference on the eve of the talks.\u201cThe steps you have taken towards national reconciliation need to be further strengthened, broadened and consolidated,\u201d he told reporters.Representatives from the insurgents said the military had launched new attacks on rebel positions in the northern states of Shan and Kachin on Tuesday morning.They warned the move threatened to scupper progress at the peace talks.\u201cFor the moment it is hard for any group to believe or trust the army,\u201d said one negotiator for the armed rebels, who asked not to be named as the talks are sensitive. \u201cHere (in the national capital Naypyidaw) they are talking about peace, there they are fighting,\u201d the negotiator added. Rebels from some of the worst-hit states want the military to declare a unilateral ceasefire and appoint an international figure to oversee its observance on the ground, the negotiator said. Some 220,000 people are currently displaced by ongoing fighting in Kachin and Shan states and by sectarian tensions in the western state of Rakhine, according to UN figures released this week.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Fresh violence overshadows Myanmar peace talks"}}
{"1281017": {"date": "Updated August 31, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tThe writer is an attorney teaching constitutional law and political philosophy.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nRishiraj Singh is the excise commissioner in the Indian state of Kerala. In the most recent photograph of him that I could find, he sports the khaki uniform of his position and a formidable moustache. In the last half of August, however, Rishiraj Singh has become known for something else, an edict against men who stare at women. While addressing a small group of people in the city of Kochi on women\u2019s safety, Singh declared that any man found staring at a woman for more than 14 seconds could be put in jail. Since India is a country of men who like to stare, his statement provoked immediate attention and ire; the Indian newspaper India Express labelled the statement \u2018absurd\u2019 and included an interview with a lawyer who said that there was no such law. Others largely took the same tone: how dare Indian men be threatened with imprisonment for staring at Indian women. In the words of one Indian attorney: \u201cThere is no such provision in any law of this country and there cannot be such a mindless provision of law in any other country of the world. Period.\u201d The message to women, Indian and otherwise: it\u2019s a man\u2019s world and staring at women must necessarily be a part of it. \nMen stare and stare and stare \u2014 old men and young men; bearded men and clean-shaven men; the supposedly religious and the avowedly secular. Staring at women is indeed the glue that binds.\n\nPakistan is also a country of staring men. Any Pakistani woman, young or old, rich or poor, has her staring stories \u2014 tales of men who stare at women in buses, at school, restaurants, banks, work and in parks. All of them will tell you that there is no corner of Pakistan that is not populated by men who stare. Learning to put up with staring is possibly the first line in the book of male dominance that is the contemporary Pakistani story. Men stare and stare and stare \u2014 old men and young men; bearded men and clean-shaven men; the supposedly religious and the avowedly secular. Staring at women is indeed the glue that binds the male species of the subcontinent together. They may disagree on politics, be at each other\u2019s throats over religion, stab and shoot at the provocations of sectarianism or the particulars of ethnicity, but they all believe in staring, everywhere and always. All of these reasons make the statement by the excise commissioner interesting and almost revolutionary. The male of the South Asian species does not generally like to admit his proclivities for visual excess and optic dominance, let alone abridge them. If and when men are confronted about staring, they deny they have partaken of such activity.Indeed, perhaps because it is so prevalent, engaged in with such zest and regularity, it is possible that the men who do it, like addicts of other kinds, believe their own lies. I never stare, have never stared, will never stare, all rolling off their tongues with the ease granted by practice. And all the while staring continues unabated and everywhere.In the odd and unlikely case that staring is even admitted to, the perpetrator moves from denial to the shifting of blame, staring pinned on the wayward women, who by their very existence, their insistence on going to work or school or riding a bus or travelling in a car, or paying a bill or buying vegetables, conspire to wheedle men into staring. It is an old trick and all men, young and old, can perform it with the prowess of Olympic athletes. Interestingly, males of the human species are not alone in the act of staring. Experts point out that prolonged staring among other living creatures signals a challenge and an act of domination. If one among this variety stares at an opponent for more than 14 seconds, it would be because he wants to make a clear statement about who is boss: the starer and not the stared at.Beyond animal science, feminist social theorists and philosophers have long pointed out how the \u2018male gaze\u2019 serves to intimidate and discipline women. It\u2019s not a revolutionary thesis; its implications in the Pakistani context and in many other parts of the Muslim world have meant a very literal disciplining, shoving women out of the public sphere into the private one, its crude and pathetic logic insisting that if there are no women to stare at, men will not stare.For all of these reasons, it is not absurd but quite groundbreaking to suggest a law that would punish men for staring at women for longer than 14 seconds. If the men who indulge in it want to understand just how insulting, intrusive and lecherous it is to maintain a largely unwanted eye contact for this period, I suggest they all request another man to stare at them for just that period. Many revelations are in store for them if and when they do, chief among them how insulting, intrusive and repulsive staring is for the subject of the constant gaze. At the end, they can spare a moment to consider the exponential rate at which these repugnant consequences are multiplied when the arrangement is not an experiment, and the one staring not a friend or colleague.  One is not sure how many men would want to partake of the experiment. After all, who wants to experience something disgusting; the wealthy never wish to pretend to be poor, the powerful never play at being powerless and so why should those who are smug about their staring habits, ever attempt to understand just how coercive and unpleasant this action is for the other half of the population. Among men of this sort, the commissioner from Kerala is a venerable and hopeful exception, one man who realises that for staring to stop, it must be fined and punished, exposed as perverse and disgusting; it might be okay in the animal kingdom but certainly not for the human species.

Since taking power after his father's death in late 2011, Kim is believed to have executed or demoted a number of senior figures in what analysts say is an attempt to tighten his grip on power. \"Vice premier for education Kim Yong-Jin was executed,\" Seoul's Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-Hee said at a regular briefing. Kim was killed by a firing squad in July as \"an anti-party, anti-revolutionary agitator,\" added an official at the ministry, who declined to be named. \"Kim Yong-Jin was denounced for his bad sitting posture when he was sitting below the rostrum\" during a session of North Korea's parliament, and then underwent a interrogation that revealed his other crimes, the official told reporters.The mass-selling JoongAng Ilbo first reported on Tuesday that top figures had been punished, but identified the education official by a different name. \"He incurred the wrath of Kim after he dozed off during a meeting presided over by Kim. He was arrested on site and intensively questioned by the state security ministry,\" it quoted a source as saying. Fall of spymaster\nThe unification ministry said two other senior figures were forced to undergo re-education sessions. \nOne of them was Kim Yong-Chol, a top official in charge of inter-Korean affairs and espionage activities against the South. The 71-year-old Kim is a career military intelligence official who is believed to be the mastermind behind the North's frequent cyberattacks against Seoul. Kim is also blamed by the South for the sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010 near the disputed sea border with the North in the Yellow Sea. Kim was banished to an agricultural farm in July for a month for his \"arrogance\" and \"abuse of power,\" the ministry official said. Kim Yong-Chol, who was subsequently reinstated this month, is likely to be tempted to prove his loyalty by committing provocative acts against the South, the official said. \"Therefore, we are keeping a close tab on the North,\" he said. South Korea's Yonhap news agency put the number of party officials executed during Kim Jong-Un's rule at over 100. The most notorious case was that of Kim's uncle and onetime No. 2 Jang Song-Thaek, who was executed for charges including treason and corruption in December 2013. In April 2015, it was reported that Kim had his defence minister Hyon Yong-Chol summarily executed with an anti-aircraft gun. Reports of the latest execution coincide with a series of high-profile defections from the North. \nNorth Korea's deputy ambassador to Britain has defected to the South with his family, the unification ministry said earlier this month. Thae Yong-Ho was driven by \"disgust for the North Korean regime\" and concerns for his family's future, it said. Twelve waitresses and their manager who had been working at a North Korea-themed restaurant in China also made headlines when they arrived in the South in April as the largest group defection for years.About 10 North Korean diplomats made it to the South in the first half of this year alone, Yonhap said, quoting informed sources.\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "North Korea executes vice premier for 'disrespect': Seoul"}}

The project aims at overcoming the problems of existing overcrowded graveyards and building new ones with necessary infrastructure facilities like hearse service, mortuary and a toll free helpline to provide burial related services on one phone call. They are already under-construction in Lahore, Multan, Faisalabad and Sargodha.Graveyard is a subject of the Local Government Department. The new authority is being created under a new law without withdrawing local government\u2019s related powers. This authority will complement the Local Government Department and establish graveyards on its request. It will also create graveyards wherever the space is available as the law does not restrict anyone from establishing a graveyard in the province, an official say. The authority will have a one-line budget. It will have enforcement, architectural-engineering and administration-finance wings. A separate enforcement division will have a force that will be deployed at every Shehr-i- Khamoshan to secure its property in case of encroachments. It will also ensure a trouble-free functioning at all levels. Furthermore, the district implementation arm will oversee the functioning and ensure smooth operations. Any serious legal or administrative or political issues arising at the district level will be handled in collaboration with the district government. The local government representative concerned will be a part of the district level infrastructure of the authority. Philanthropists, companies, and individuals as well as the elected representatives of the local governments willing to take charge of a particular graveyard\u2019s maintenance will be allowed to do so if they adhere to the standard operating procedure (SOP) of the authority.

It was informative and revealing in many aspects. Regarding some of the controversial cases discussed in the book, starting from the Tamizuddin Khan case and ending with the Asma Jilani case, he said the author had rightly mentioned that one step taken in the wrong direction could hardly be corrected by subsequent steps taken in the right direction. Talking about a couple of cases given in the book, he said that when Gen Ziaul Haq suspended the Constitution, legitimacy was accorded through the Begum Nusrat Bhutto case. He said the author had amply demonstrated how the case was decided. It was followed by the Z. A. Bhutto case, he said.Referring to his father, Justice Wahiduddin, and by developing his arguments on the cases, Justice Wajihuddin said very little had been said on the merit of Bhutto\u2019s conviction \u2014 either bias or technicalities clouded the issue. He said perhaps a dispassionate analysis of the facts and circumstances of the case were overdue. After Gen Zia\u2019s death, he said, a democracy of sorts was ushered in which was, once again, disrupted by Gen Musharraf. He said he (Musharraf) was legitimised through the Zafar Ali Shah case, and lasted till 2007/08 when followed by the lawyers\u2019 movement he was rendered a \u2018lame duck\u2019. Since 2008, he said, we again had some semblance of democracy. \u201cThe history of the judiciary in Pakistan is more or less a history of judicial responses to successive military interventions,\u201d he remarked. He said there had been too many martial laws, besides the five full-blown afflictions, including the civilian martial law of Z. A. Bhutto. He said countries in the Third World should never forget that few mega events occurred here without oversight from abroad. He said it was obvious that as and when one-window operation was required, \u201ccometh the hour, cometh the man\u201d. The way out was only if the civilian government performed, he said.Former governor of Sindh Kamal Azfar said reading the different chapters of the book made us realise that justices were not super humans \u2014 they too had weaknesses. Taking issue with the author\u2019s views, he said the role of Justice Munir needed a slight review. About Justice Cornelius, too, Mr Azfar said that though he was a great judge he helped the drafting of the LFO. He said a chapter on the 18th amendment was missing from the book (perhaps because the manuscript was sent earlier than that period). He rounded off his speech by saying there was the need for only one amendment and that was \u2018repeal all the amendments\u2019.Former Attorney General of Pakistan Munir A. Malik said history had two clear meanings: one was described by Toynbee as \u201chistory is the transformation of tumultuous conquerors into silent footnotes\u201d; the second was contemporary history. Beginning to explain the second one he said two real (haqeeqi) former chief justices were on stage \u2014 Justice Wajihuddin and Justice Sarmad Jalal Usmani. Mr Malik said the author of the book, Hamid Khan, was one of the few lawyers who had written copiously. He said as Mr Azfar he did not agree with many things written in the book, but it was Hamid Khan\u2019s version of things as he saw them. The version, however, had appeared when the judges discussed in the book were no longer in office, he said.Dr Syed Jaffer Ahmed said the book had three salient features. First, it was in chronological order. Two, it talked about some very important cases. Three, it discussed the different judges and their conduct. He said what came out of the book was that the judiciary had fought the battle for its survival; it had been involved in judicial activism; areas where its legal competence was found lacking; the fact that it had no set philosophy. He said people expected a lot from the judiciary but forgot that it was one of the institutions of the state. If the state was thought to be a national security state, then the judiciary would operate in that paradigm, he said.Faisal Siddiqui said the book focused on two aspects, constitutional cases and the judiciary\u2019s relationship with the political and military executive.Zahid Khan said he had learnt a great deal from the speeches and he might add some of the information provided by the speakers to the next edition of the book. He thanked them for appreciating his \u2018humble\u2019 contribution.     A. H. Khanzada also spoke.

Senators Afrasiab Khattak of the Awami National Party and Farhatullah Babar of the PPP were among those attending, and expressed solidarity with the families of missing persons. They said they would raise the enforced disappearances issue within their political parties and in parliament. Prominent activist Amina Masood Janjua, who heads the Defence of Human Rights Organisation (DHRO) also spoke at the demonstration. The whereabouts of Ms Janjua\u2019s husband, Masood Janjua, remain unknown after 11 years. She recalled that when they were in the Opposition, PML-N leader and current prime minister Mian Nawaz Sharif and PTI\u2019s Imran Khan \u2013 whose party is currently in power in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa \u2013 visited her protest camp at D Chowk in solidarity and assured her they would return her husband and thousands of other missing persons when they came to power.

Under the SC\u2019s orders, the first commission of inquiry into IEDs was set up in 2010, but it did not receive the requisite level of powers, independence and autonomy. Ms Abdullah demanded that the state sign and ratify the International Convention for the Protection of all Persons against Enforced Disappearances, and enact legislation to criminalise enforced disappearances. \u201cIf Sri Lanka could ratify it, why not Pakistan,\u201d she asked. Speakers also demanded that the authorities release all those detained illegally \u2013 whether in safe houses, prisons or in any kind of centre.Parliamentarians and activists argued that if there is evidence or proof against individuals, they must be tried in court to uphold the rule of law.

The HRCP has also said that large-scale enforced disappearances in South Asia can only be addressed if all of the region\u2019s governments immediately criminalise this serious human rights violation. The HRCP said that in Pakistan, the practice of enforced disappearances has become a nationwide problem in recent years.

While a draft policy was developed in 2010, it was not approved due to the ongoing process of devolution.\nNational Health Vision aims to make healthcare policies uniform across country\n\nThe development of this document started in mid-2015 and extensive consultations were held with all stakeholders. The process began with meetings with provincial health ministers and their teams, the objective of which was to generate consensus for a common national vision on health, she said.This was followed by technical consultative meetings with all stakeholders, which helped determine the roles and responsibilities, as well as enhancing coordination between the federal ministry and provincial health departments.The NHV is in line with Vision 2025, international health priorities and based on provincial realities within the framework of constitutional roles in the post-18th Amendment scenario, Ms Tarar said.\u201cThe aim is to achieve universal health coverage, resulting in a fairer, more efficient [system of] health financing that pools risk and shares costs equitably,\u201d she added.The vision also includes a monitoring and evaluation mechanism, conducted through an inter-provincial health and population council. The council will be responsible for overseeing the vision\u2019s implementation and will endorse reports that will be presented to parliament on an annual basis, the minister said.The document will now be placed before the Council of Common Interests (CCI) for final approval.Talking to Dawn, former health minister Dr Sania Nishtar extolled the need for a national healthcare vision, which was necessitated by the governing structures of healthcare delivery in Pakistan.Dr Nishtar, who authored the seminal 2010 paper \u2018Health and the 18th Amendment: Retaining National Roles in Devolution\u2019, was also responsible for the creation of the current Ministry of National Health Services following the passage of the 18th amendment.\u201cHealth was largely devolved after the 18th amendment with the provinces [being] autonomous in their prerogative to [make] health policies as they deem fit. But there are important national roles \u2014 information, regulation, coordination and compliance with international agreements \u2014 which are the responsibilities of the NHS ministry under the mandates outlined in the federal legislative lists,\u201d she said.\u201cThere are complex federal-provincial inter-dependencies involved in the execution of health policies. For that reason, it is critical for the NHS ministry and the provinces to be on the same page,\u201d she said.Welcoming the unveiling of the NHV as a welcome step, Dr Nishtar said the policy took a \u201chealth systems-based vision, which is required to take forward the international commitments Pakistan has made in relation to the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly Goal 3, which relates to healthcare\u201d.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Ikram Junaidi", "title": "Centre launches new \u2018health policy\u2019 after 15-year gap"}}

Presently, two World Bank-sponsored projects in the education sector \u2014 $400 million education reforms programme and $66m special grant for missing facilities \u2014 are being implemented in the province.

He discussed issues related to the National Finance Commission award with Mr Dar and outstanding issues between the provincial government and the water and power ministry with Mr Asif.

The chief minister said the Sindh government and the water and power ministry were close to settling the issue of power dues. \u201cThere remains a minor difference between the claim of the ministry and the amount offered by the provincial government,\u201d he said, adding that the reconciliation of the amount had almost been decided. Mr Asif endorsed the chief minister\u2019s statement. Mr Shah said his government had established the Sindh Transmission and Despatch Company and was awaiting permission for connecting it to the national grid. The minister had assured him that the issue would be resolved soon, he added. The chief minister said that he had given a guarantee to the prime minister that Sindh would add between 1,000MW and 1,500MW to the national grid if the issues of tariff of renewable energy projects were decided. \u201cIt is encouraging that Khawaja Asif has extended his support and cooperation to resolve the issue.\u201d He said a good working relationship between the federal and provincial governments had been established which reflected in participation of federal Water and Power Secretary Yunus Dagha and Sindh Energy Secretary Agha Wasif in his meeting with the minister. Mr Shah also took up with Mr Asif the issue of prolonged hours of power loadshedding in the rural areas of Sindh, saying it had cast a negative impact on daily life and business activities. The minister assured Mr Shah that he would personally look into the matter. Loan accord signed with ADB\nAlso during the day, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) signed with the federal government an agreement for $197.85m loan for the Sindh Roads Improvement Project.

Mr Dar reiterated the government\u2019s commitment to utilise all available resources for developing the transport sector and improving inter-provincial linkages for enhanced local connectivity.

Since taking power after his father's death in late 2011, Kim is believed to have executed or demoted a number of senior figures in what analysts say is an attempt to tighten his grip on power. \"Vice premier for education Kim Yong-Jin was executed,\" Seoul's Unification Ministry spokesman Jeong Joon-Hee said at a regular briefing. Kim was killed by a firing squad in July as \"an anti-party, anti-revolutionary agitator,\" added an official at the ministry, who declined to be named. \"Kim Yong-Jin was denounced for his bad sitting posture when he was sitting below the rostrum\" during a session of North Korea's parliament, and then underwent a interrogation that revealed his other crimes, the official told reporters.The mass-selling JoongAng Ilbo first reported on Tuesday that top figures had been punished, but identified the education official by a different name. \"He incurred the wrath of Kim after he dozed off during a meeting presided over by Kim. He was arrested on site and intensively questioned by the state security ministry,\" it quoted a source as saying. Fall of spymaster\nThe unification ministry said two other senior figures were forced to undergo re-education sessions. \nOne of them was Kim Yong-Chol, a top official in charge of inter-Korean affairs and espionage activities against the South. The 71-year-old Kim is a career military intelligence official who is believed to be the mastermind behind the North's frequent cyberattacks against Seoul. Kim is also blamed by the South for the sinking of a South Korean warship in 2010 near the disputed sea border with the North in the Yellow Sea. Kim was banished to an agricultural farm in July for a month for his \"arrogance\" and \"abuse of power,\" the ministry official said. Kim Yong-Chol, who was subsequently reinstated this month, is likely to be tempted to prove his loyalty by committing provocative acts against the South, the official said. \"Therefore, we are keeping a close tab on the North,\" he said. South Korea's Yonhap news agency put the number of party officials executed during Kim Jong-Un's rule at over 100. The most notorious case was that of Kim's uncle and onetime No. 2 Jang Song-Thaek, who was executed for charges including treason and corruption in December 2013. In April 2015, it was reported that Kim had his defence minister Hyon Yong-Chol summarily executed with an anti-aircraft gun.

One can add one more episode to the list: on Tuesday, Waseem Akhtar, the mayor of Pakistan\u2019s biggest city, was let out of jail briefly in order to take the oath of office. Earlier, Mr Akhtar had been elected Karachi mayor from jail \u2014 a first in our chequered political history. He has been in custody since July and faces a number of cases \u2014 all bailable according to him. These include involvement in the May 12, 2007 violence in Karachi. At the time of the ugly events, Waseem Akhtar held the portfolio of home adviser to the Sindh chief minister. These and other charges the mayor faces are serious and must be probed impartially. If he is found guilty, Mr Akhtar must face the penalty under the law and would obviously have to leave the mayor\u2019s office. However, as the highest elected official of Karachi, it is unacceptable that Mr Akhtar runs the metropolis\u2019s affairs from inside prison, especially if the charges are bailable. Besides, it appears a tad strange for the mayor to be locked up for his alleged role in the May 12 mayhem while retired Gen Musharraf \u2014 who ruled the country unchallenged at the time \u2014 enjoys his liberty. Until the charges against Waseem Akhtar are proved, he should be allowed his freedom.However, even if the Karachi mayor were to be released, it would be fair to ask if Mr Akhtar would have the necessary powers to administer the city. As the provincial government has kept many civic powers, such as solid waste management, we can safely say that the elected heads of municipal bodies in Sindh will not have full authority over their respective jurisdictions. This situation needs to be reversed as municipal bodies must have more than just ceremonial powers to carry out their tasks. Sindh Chief Minister Murad Ali Shah has brought vigour to the erstwhile moribund provincial government in many ways. He must realise that empowered and active local governments are essential for the prosperity and progress of Sindh, which is why he ought to make it a priority to transfer all civic duties to the elected municipal bodies. It will take a long time to address all the issues that have cropped up in the long absence of elected local bodies. But with responsive local leaders and a supportive provincial government, the rot can hopefully be reversed.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Jailed Karachi mayor"}}
