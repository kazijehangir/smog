{"1281014": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "THEIR slim hopes stand extinguished. Sixteen men sentenced to death by military courts had turned to the Supreme Court as their last resort. All 16 have had their appeals rejected. A year after the Supreme Court upheld the 21st Amendment \u2014 an act carried out by parliament at the behest of the military \u2014 and acquiesced in the controversial changes to the Constitution, a smaller bench was always going to struggle to overturn the collective will of the full court, parliament and the country\u2019s establishment. While the 21st Amendment judgement left the narrowest of doors open for judicial review of military court verdicts, it would have required enormous courage and vigorous judicial activism for any individual sentenced to death by a military court to be able to win a reprieve no matter the obvious deficiencies in the standards of justice meted out. In truth, it may have also been an unfair burden to expect a few judges to stand between the collective, considered and determined will of all other institutions of the state. Signing off on death sentences handed down in the most opaque of manners is a grim day for justice in this country, but perhaps also an inevitable one given how little support those fighting for the centrality of fundamental rights have received since December 2014.Grim as the judicial verdict has been, the blight should not stay forever. At the heart of the 21st Amendment judgement were two things: one, the acceptance of the constitutionality of military courts, and, therefore, a largely hands-off approach to their working; and two, the recognition that military court trials for civilians accused of terrorism would be a temporary measure. The sunset of the sunset clause is nearing \u2014 in January the constitutional protection to the 21st Amendment military courts will expire. Parliament must stand resolute in its commitment to granting only a two-year life to military courts. Presumably, the dismissal of the 16 appeals will be used by advocates of military courts to argue that not only are the courts functioning within the law, but that the superior judiciary had found no flaw in the trials of accused militants. But the flaw is in their very conception, an anomalous court structure rammed through parliament in the cataclysmic aftermath of the APS Peshawar attack. Come January, military courts must be allowed to quietly expire and the overall judicial system made palatable again.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Dismissal of appeals"}}

The 3.5 million who ultimately entered Pakistan consisted of different classes of society.The majority were from rural areas and were mostly illiterate but skilled in agriculture, transport etc. They went into their relevant fields dislodging the locals by being more productive and demanding lower wages. Their labour turned barren and neglected land into lush fields producing vegetables and crops of sugarcane, wheat, corn, tobacco and cotton to mention a few. Other Afghans became labourers or started petty businesses selling whatever they could think of. Surprisingly not a single Afghan was seen begging on the streets; instead they would prefer to collect garbage and sift it for recyclable items to sell to the scrap dealer.The educated lot from Afghnaistan\u2019s urban areas used Pakistan as a transit camp to shift mostly to the West seeking political asylum with their cash and valuables to start businesses there.A big number opted to stay, some in camps while others obtained computerised national identity cards and started businesses and purchased land.

The work to be carried out on the three sites involves installing of water gauges at each dam site and setting up of a powerhouse to observe the water level and its flow, reviewing the stage-discharge relations at the dam sites and the tail water of the powerhouse, sampling and analysing of the sediment, topography, and review of geological maps and conditions. \u201cWhen the work plan by the CTG has already been submitted, delay on the part of the client in carrying out these site investigations and surveys is baffling,\u201d the Wapda official observed. He added that senior officials must give priority to work on the hydropower projects instead of \u201cdelaying assignments unnecessarily\u201d. Muhammad Nawaz Butt, general manager of the Diamer-Bhasha project, refused to comment on the issue. \u201cI am not authorised to speak on the matter,\u201d he replied. Wapda\u2019s director of public relations did not come up with the authority\u2019s version despite repeated calls and reminders over the last few days.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Khalid Hasnain", "title": "Wapda\u2019s inaction holds up work on three dam sites by Chinese firm"}}
{"1281114": {"date": "Updated August 31, 2016", "article": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakis\u00adtan Tehreek-i-Insaf\u2019s (PTI) long-awaited petition, asking for the disqualification of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and members of his family for their alleged involvement in the Panamagate scandal, met the same fate as the recently returned petition filed by the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI).The Supreme Court office on Tuesday handed the petition back to the party\u2019s Advocate-on-Record Chaud\u00adhry Akhtar Ali, a day after it was filed by senior counsel Naeem Bokhari. The objections raised by the court office were identical to the ones highlighted when the JI petition was returned, i.e. the petition, prima facie (on the face of it), appeared to be frivolous.The petition, which was filed in the name of PTI chairman Imran Khan, sought the disqualification of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, his son-in-law retired Captain Mohammad Safdar and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.\u201cThat this petition prima facie appears to be a frivolous petition within the contemplation of Order XVII Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980,\u201d explained the order issued by the registrar\u2019s office when the petition was returned.Under the Rule 5 of Order XVII, the registrar has the authority to refuse to receive a petition on the grounds that it has not been filed in accordance with the rules, or is frivolous, or contains scandalous matter.Under the same rules, the petitioner has the right to move an appeal within a fortnight of the petition\u2019s return, which would then be heard by a judge of the apex court in his chambers.\u201cAll these questions ought to have been decided by the court and not the registrar\u2019s office,\u201d senior PTI leader Ishaq Khakwani told Dawn.The registrar had violated the Constitution, he said, adding that the party\u2019s legal team was carefully analysing the registrar\u2019s objections and would soon file an appeal against the order.Mr Khakwani recalled that earlier scores of cases were entertained by the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) and such objections were never raised by the registrar\u2019s office. \u201cWe have every reason to believe that the registrar has acted in bad faith,\u201d he regretted.Separately, party spokesperson Naeemul Haq announced that a legal team headed by senior counsel Hamid Khan was in the process of finalising an appeal against the registrar\u2019s order, which would be moved soon.On Aug 27, the court office declined to accept a petition moved by JI emir Sirajul Haq, where he had asked the Supreme Court to declare the illegal transfer of national wealth for investments in offshore companies an offence under Section 9 of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO).On May 13, the Supreme Court returned a somewhat similar request from the federal government, asking the court to appoint a commission of inquiry to conduct a probe into the Panamagate affair, on the grounds that any such commission formed under the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act, 1956 would result in the constitution of a toothless commission that would serve no useful purpose, except bringing a bad name to the judiciary.The court had also declared the terms of reference \u2014 sent to it by the government under public pressure \u2014 \u201cwide and open-ended\u201d, saying that it might take years for such a commission to close its proceedings.On Tuesday, the court office informed the applicants that the petitioner was directly invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution \u2014 that deals with the \u2018enforcement of fundamental rights\u2019 \u2013 which is not permissible in light of the precedent laid down in the 1998 matter of Zulfikar Mehdi vs PIA.In that case, the apex court had interpreted the term \u2018public importance\u2019 and laid down that the expression should be viewed with reference to freedom and liberties guaranteed under the Constitution, their protection and the invasion of these rights in a manner which raises serious questions regarding their enforcement.The issues arising in a case cannot be considered questions of public importance if a decision on those issues only affects the rights of an individual or a group of individuals, the judgement had held.In its order, the registrar office also stated that the petitioner had approached the Supreme Court without first approaching an appropriate forum under the law, not did the petitioner provide any justification for not approaching any other forum.Similarly, the certificate provided by the petitioner alongside the petition did not fulfil the requirements of Rule 6 of Order XXV of the Supreme Court rules.This rule requires the applicant to state in clear terms whether the petitioner has moved the concerned high court for the same relief, and if so, what was the result.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Nasir Iqbal", "title": "SC returns PTI\u2019s \u2018frivolous\u2019 petition"}}

Jones will be president of ride-sharing at Uber, running local Uber services in every city, as well as marketing efforts and customer support.The hire underscores efforts by Uber, which has become the dominant on-demand ride service, to bolster its reputation and brand. Since 2009, the company has aggressively expanded to more than 450 cities, at times steamrolling regulators and launching campaigns against local lawmakers.Jones joined Target in 2012 to rejuvenate its brand and is credited with modernising the retailer's marketing efforts. He led campaigns including #MoreMusic, under which Target partnered with singer Gwen Stefani for a live video that aired during the Grammy Awards and released exclusive tracks from artists such as Adele, part of an effort to burnish Target's cool image.Prior to that, Jones led marketing for Gap Inc and worked for Coca-Cola and advertising firm McKinney.\u201cJones has a strong track record of driving the narrative around Target's brand, and will now try to do the same for Uber,\u201d said Mike Mannor, associate professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business.\u201cYou can surely expect to see stakeholders responding positively to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick taking steps to upgrade his middling in-house talent with proven professional chops.\u201d Kalanick said in a blog post that he and Jones met in February and \u201cwithin minutes we were debating how Uber could improve its reputation.\u201dKalanick said he wants to align Uber's marketing functions more closely with individual city operations and put more focus on customer service.Uber's global operations span dozens of countries and about 1.5 million drivers.Jones' hiring marks a change for Ryan Graves, who has been at Uber since 2010 and ran the company's operations and global expansion. Graves will give up some of those responsibilities but continue to work on Uber's delivery businesses, including UberEats and UberRush, as well as other projects, Kalanick said.Jones' exit is the latest in a string of executive departures from Target, which has made a series of management changes since last year.Among other moves, the big-box retailer appointed Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan to the newly created role of chief operating officer. It has also added new hires as it focuses on higher-margin categories such as baby and wellness products and revamps online sales.\n", "author": "Reuters", "title": "Uber hires senior Target executive to lead global operations"}}

The chief minister said after three months he would evaluate the performance of all officials and would replace, with the young blood, those who failed to deliver. He asked the officials concerned to explain why the problem of cotton pest attack had not been resolved. Similarly, he was eager to know why the people involved in manufacturing and distribution of spurious pesticides were not put in jails.

Following the company\u2019s repeated promises of \u201creleasing payments soon\u201d, the workers made a difficult decision earlier this year: they took their grievances to a labour court. However, with the legal battle yet to bear fruit, the expatriates with little money and borrowed time are quickly losing hope. \nResidence permits have expired because the fee required for their renewal has not been paid, laments a worker\n\nMost are still employed by the company as technical staff. Ali Shah*, who has been working as a bulldozer operator for the firm for a decade, says he is owed 35,000 Saudi riyals [approximately Rs980,000]. He claims that Pakistani workers are not the only ones facing such trouble at the United Seemac Co. \u201cThe company has a total of 500 employees of different nationalities, and all are in a similar situation. The trend of not paying salaries is new,\u201d he says, adding that he has not faced salary delays before. On average, workers have not been paid for nine to 16 months, though there are also some whose remunerations have reportedly been pending for 19 months. Despite the difficult circumstances, they continue to work in the hope that their dues will be paid and reside in cramped living quarters provided by the company. Their passports are in the employer\u2019s possession, and whether it is the death of a relative or an emergency, they cannot go back to Pakistan unless the employer returns their passport. Iqama question\nMany of the workers hold expired iqamas, the residence permits issued to expatriates who arrive in Saudi Arabia on an employment visa. Blaming the company for the expired permits, another staffer Basit Sheikh says: \u201cThe company has not paid a fee employers are required to submit for iqama renewal.\u201d Sheikh said he was recently arrested for seven days for not having a valid residence permit. A list compiled by a worker and seen by Dawn shows that of the 100 Pakistani employees working at the firm, 77 have their permits expired. \u201cWithout these permits, we cannot even get medical insurance. How can we possibly have money to go see a doctor, if we often do not even have money for food?\u201d asks Sheikh. In January, when the workers filed an official complaint with the labour court, Sheikh and another Pakistani worker represented the concerns of the complainants. According to documents seen by Dawn, the plaintiffs demanded that they be paid the pending salaries and their iqamas renewed. After three recorded hearings, the case was transferred to a higher court. \u201cThe representative of the company attended the last hearing; we found him uninterested in dealing with us [workers]. So now we are taking the case to a higher court,\u201d says Sheikh. Adding to the workers\u2019 distress is the fact that the company is holding their passports, making travel next to impossible. Saad Khan, an employee of the company for the past 12 years, says: \u201cIf I quit today, they will give me my passport and allow me to leave. But this would mean leaving behind my pending salary.\u201d For Khan, whose 11 pay cheques are owed to him, this is simply not an option. Company\u2019s problem\nThe plight of the workers at the construction firm is not unique. As has been widely reported, with oil revenues decreasing, the kingdom has cut down state spending, and construction firms have taken a hit. The company\u2019s general manager, Abu Mohammed, reportedly told online news organisation Middle East Eye that they were unable to pay employees because the Saudi government had failed to compensate the firm for completed contract work. Representatives of the firm could not be contacted despite several email and telephone communication attempts. In July, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Of\u00ad\u00adfi\u00ad\u00adce took notice when another construction firm had failed to pay 500 Pakistanis their dues. \u201c[The] Min\u00adis\u00ad\u00ad\u00adtry of Foreign Affairs and Pak\u00adistan Embassy in Riyadh are making every effort to resolve the difficulties being faced by Pakis\u00adtani nationals, working for Saad Group of Companies in Dam\u00adm\u00ad\u00adam\u2026,\u201d Foreign Office spokesman Nafees Zakaria had told Dawn. Non-payment of salaries affected 8,000 individuals at the Saad Group of Companies. Workers of the United Seemac Co feel that because they are emp\u00adloyed by a much smaller organisation, no one knows their situation. \u201cOne week ago we also went to Pakistan Embassy in Riyadh to lodge a complaint, but we did not receive any good response from them,\u201d said Sheikh. With a pending legal case and limited options, the employees continue to work for the firm. \u201cThey give us small sums of money sometimes. Just recently workers in Riyadh were given about 50 Saudi riyals [about Rs1,400] each,\u201d Khan says. This, however, is barely enough for him to feed himself, let alone support his family back in Pakistan. *Names have been changed to protect identity as the workers are not authorised to speak to journalistsAdditional reporting by Mahnoor BariPublished in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Fahad Naveed", "title": "Expatriate Pakistanis struggle as Saudi construction firm holds wages"}}

{"1281334": {"date": "Updated September 01, 2016", "article": "KARACHI: Thousands of Pakistani labourers working in Saudi Arabia fear arrest and hardship as they continue to work in the country with unpaid salaries and expired work permits. \u201cWe rush back to our quarters immediately after work,\u201d one worker tells Dawn in a telephone interview. \u201cWe are too scared of the police to step outside.\u201d At least 100 workers were thrust into uncertainty after their employer, the United Seemac Co., a construction company, allegedly failed to pay their salaries for several months. Following the company\u2019s repeated promises of \u201creleasing payments soon\u201d, the workers made a difficult decision earlier this year: they took their grievances to a labour court. However, with the legal battle yet to bear fruit, the expatriates with little money and borrowed time are quickly losing hope. \nResidence permits have expired because the fee required for their renewal has not been paid, laments a worker\n\nMost are still employed by the company as technical staff. Ali Shah*, who has been working as a bulldozer operator for the firm for a decade, says he is owed 35,000 Saudi riyals [approximately Rs980,000]. He claims that Pakistani workers are not the only ones facing such trouble at the United Seemac Co. \u201cThe company has a total of 500 employees of different nationalities, and all are in a similar situation. The trend of not paying salaries is new,\u201d he says, adding that he has not faced salary delays before. On average, workers have not been paid for nine to 16 months, though there are also some whose remunerations have reportedly been pending for 19 months. Despite the difficult circumstances, they continue to work in the hope that their dues will be paid and reside in cramped living quarters provided by the company. Their passports are in the employer\u2019s possession, and whether it is the death of a relative or an emergency, they cannot go back to Pakistan unless the employer returns their passport. Iqama question\nMany of the workers hold expired iqamas, the residence permits issued to expatriates who arrive in Saudi Arabia on an employment visa. Blaming the company for the expired permits, another staffer Basit Sheikh says: \u201cThe company has not paid a fee employers are required to submit for iqama renewal.\u201d Sheikh said he was recently arrested for seven days for not having a valid residence permit. A list compiled by a worker and seen by Dawn shows that of the 100 Pakistani employees working at the firm, 77 have their permits expired. \u201cWithout these permits, we cannot even get medical insurance. How can we possibly have money to go see a doctor, if we often do not even have money for food?\u201d asks Sheikh. In January, when the workers filed an official complaint with the labour court, Sheikh and another Pakistani worker represented the concerns of the complainants. According to documents seen by Dawn, the plaintiffs demanded that they be paid the pending salaries and their iqamas renewed. After three recorded hearings, the case was transferred to a higher court. \u201cThe representative of the company attended the last hearing; we found him uninterested in dealing with us [workers]. So now we are taking the case to a higher court,\u201d says Sheikh. Adding to the workers\u2019 distress is the fact that the company is holding their passports, making travel next to impossible.

As a result the village collects rights from firms that have used the Tomatina for its adverts, such as South Korean tech giant Samsung and Australian travel insurance provider Cover Moore.Each film shooting generates around 300,000 euros ($335,000) for the town from the rights, as well as from providing housing and food for the visiting film crews, according to the official web page of the Tomatina.Bunol city hall cooperates with other cities which want to hold its own version of the Tomatina for free because it provides publicity for the town and its festival, said Perez.\u201cAt the end of the day what everyone wants is to go to the original version, which is ours, so it is to our advantage,\u201d he added.Versions of the Tomatina have been held annually or as one-off events in Colombia, Chile, Cuba, India, South Korea and the United States.\u201cWe always try to cooperate with anyone who wants, so that the image of the Tomatina is reinforced abroad,\u201d said Perez.Giant ball and wine Other Spanish towns with unusual festivals are seeking to copy Bunol\u2019s success.The tiny town of Mataelpino near Madrid registered its annual fiesta, dubbed the \u201cBoloencierro\u201d, which involves pitting daredevils against a giant 200-kilogram polystyrene ball as it gathers steam heading downhill towards the village bullring.The ball \u2014 three metres in diameter \u2014 has since 2010 replaced bulls used in a traditional bull run in which daredevils raced ahead of a pack of half-tonne fighting bulls along a similar route. The risk is real \u2014 the ball has injured several participants.The switch was motivated by Spain\u2019s economic downturn which forced towns like Mataelpino to cut costs on its annual festivals and it has proven popular.The town holds the \u201cBoloencierro\u201d, a combination of the Spanish words for \u201cball\u201d and \u201cbull run\u201d, every August.Mirroring the example of Bunol, Mataelpino is helping six other Spanish towns to hold their own versions of the Boloencierro this year. The goal is to draw more visitors to its own event.\u201cThe municipality is trying to use this festival as a tourist draw,\u201d said Mataelpino mayor Javier de los Nietos.The town of Haro in the northern La Rioja wine-making region began the process this year to have its annual \u201cwine fight\u201d declared a \u201cFestival of International Interest\u201d. The event sees thousands of locals and tourists celebrate St Peter\u2019s day in June by throwing thousands of litres of wine at each other, with buckets, wineskins or water pistols.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Diego Urdaneta", "title": "Spanish towns seek to repeat success of Tomatina festival"}}
{"1281234": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "KARACHI: Academic activities were suspended at eight major public sector universities in the province on Wednesday in response to a call for strike given by the Sindh chapter of the Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association (Fapuasa).At Karachi University (KU) teachers addressed a press conference after boycott of classes to vent anger and frustration over prolonged financial crisis the university had been facing and the way the provincial government had been handling affairs at universities.They warned the government of a \u2018strong agitation\u2019 soon after Eid if the government did not release the Rs350m grant it had announced last year for the university.Listing a number of other demands, teachers, which included the society\u2019s office-bearers as well as members of the university\u2019s statutory bodies, called upon the government to immediately withdraw what they described as \u2018unilateral amendments\u2019 to the Sindh Universities Law 2013, and either activate the provincial higher education commission in consultation with senior teachers or abolish the body altogether.The demands which were put forward to the provincial government included making appointments to all key administrative posts through a selection board, removing retired administrative officers, making regular appointments to all posts including that of the vice chancellor (who was currently working on ad hoc basis), initiating meaningful investigation into financial malpractices on the campus, adopting a uniform policy for teachers and non-teaching staff of all universities, increasing KU grant to Rs1bn and payment of leave encashment to all KU employees before Eid, which, they said, was being paid to staff at other universities.\u201cThis has now become an issue of discrimination against KU. The government must pay leave encashment to all university employees before Eid,\u201d president Kuts Dr Shakeel Farooqi demanded.The university would be shut if the issues were not addressed, he warned.\u201cIt\u2019s no more possible to continue academic activities in an environment lacking requisite paraphernalia; the university\u2019s physical infrastructure badly needs repair, labs are functioning without a whole set of chemicals and proper equipment while no funds are available to purchase research journals for libraries,\u201d he explained in response to a question.Teachers also demanded the Higher Education Commission (HEC) increase university grant and pay full salary including the raise announced by the government. \u201cPresently, the deficit the university faces under the head of staff salaries is Rs800m. In other words, the government only pays eight months\u2019 salaries to KU staff. The rest is to be arranged by the university itself,\u201d he said.On the autonomous status of universities, he said teachers had been protesting against the controversial amendments for the past three years but to no avail. It was the assemblies, he observed, which made the universities independent bodies and agreed to have an apolitical dignitary as chancellor (governor) as a representative of the federal government. \u201cThis has been so because a large chunk of university grant comes from the federal government. But, when a political worker or a person perceived as a representative of the establishment becomes the governor and provincial government brings a law that serves its own vested interests, the entire system at universities is ruined, as has been happening,\u201d he noted.On the role of provincial HEC, it was pointed out that since the Punjab HEC had decided to work with the federal HEC, Sindh was now left alone.Meanwhile, vice president of the Fapuasa-centre Dr Kalimullah Bareech supported the Kuts stance. \u201cWe support all universities of Sindh in their struggle and demand the government and the HEC address their concerns. Otherwise a nationwide strike will be observed at universities,\u201d he said.HYDERABAD: Teachers and non-teaching staff boycotted academic activities the Sindh University in response to the Sindh chapter of Fapuasa\u2019s call. The protest was later joined by the Sindh Universities Officers Federation as well.Academic and non-academic staff boycotted work and participated in a demonstration which was led by Fapuasa\u2019s Sindh chapter president Dr Shahnawaz Talpur along with the federation\u2019s provincial general secretary Dr Farid Ahmed Memon and others. The leaders said that amendments suggested by Fapuasa should be made part of the law and opposed interference by Sindh government and Higher Education Commission (HEC) in the universities\u2019 affairs. They demanded that all appointments in the universities should be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in the universities\u2019 regulations. The Mehran University Officers\u2019 Welfare Association also claimed in a statement that officers and staff boycotted work in protest against appointment of retirees to administrative positions. They demanded removal of such officers and staged a sit-in. Later, the Mehran university employees association also joined the protest, it said. The protesters\u2019 office-bearers said that Sindh government had appointed registrar of Mehran University in violation of set procedure.

Russia is appealing the Swiss-based International Paralympics Committee\u2019s decision this month to ban its athletes from the Sept. 7-18 competition. After losing before the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne last week, Russia took its case to the Swiss Federal Court. The tribunal decided that the Russian delegation had not done enough to justify an immediate lifting of the ban on its athletes in Rio, a court statement said. \u201cThe Russian Paralympic Committee would have needed to demonstrate it had fulfilled its obligations in upholding... anti-doping protocols, and that its interests in an immediate lifting of its suspension outweigh the International Paralympics Committee\u2019s interests in fighting doping and in the integrity of athletics. It did not succeed in this in any way,\u201d it said. The court is limited to ruling on procedural matters. Earlier on Wednesday, Russia\u2019s Paralympic Committee chief Vladimir Lukin said the country will hold a two-day competition next week for its paralympic squad, coinciding with the official Games start in Brazil. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to hold on September 7-8 a series of tournaments for the country\u2019s Paralympic athletes at the training bases in the Moscow region,\u201d R-Sport news agency quoted Lukin as saying. Last week Russian President Vladimir Putin lashed out against the ban on the country\u2019s Paralympians, calling the decision \u201coutside the law, morality, humanity\u201d. Putin pledged that Russia instead would organise competitions for the banned Paralympians \u201cto show all their skills\u201d. A Kremlin spokesman said Wednesday that it was still to be decided if Putin would attend the event. Russia\u2019s Olympic squad narrowly escaped a total ban from the Rio Games, but its track-and-field team was suspended over evidence of state-sponsored drug cheating and corruption in the country.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Agencies", "title": "Swiss court holds fire on Russian paralympic athletes\u2019 Rio ban"}}

As a result the village collects rights from firms that have used the Tomatina for its adverts, such as South Korean tech giant Samsung and Australian travel insurance provider Cover Moore.Each film shooting generates around 300,000 euros ($335,000) for the town from the rights, as well as from providing housing and food for the visiting film crews, according to the official web page of the Tomatina.Bunol city hall cooperates with other cities which want to hold its own version of the Tomatina for free because it provides publicity for the town and its festival, said Perez.\u201cAt the end of the day what everyone wants is to go to the original version, which is ours, so it is to our advantage,\u201d he added.Versions of the Tomatina have been held annually or as one-off events in Colombia, Chile, Cuba, India, South Korea and the United States.\u201cWe always try to cooperate with anyone who wants, so that the image of the Tomatina is reinforced abroad,\u201d said Perez.Giant ball and wine Other Spanish towns with unusual festivals are seeking to copy Bunol\u2019s success.The tiny town of Mataelpino near Madrid registered its annual fiesta, dubbed the \u201cBoloencierro\u201d, which involves pitting daredevils against a giant 200-kilogram polystyrene ball as it gathers steam heading downhill towards the village bullring.The ball \u2014 three metres in diameter \u2014 has since 2010 replaced bulls used in a traditional bull run in which daredevils raced ahead of a pack of half-tonne fighting bulls along a similar route. The risk is real \u2014 the ball has injured several participants.The switch was motivated by Spain\u2019s economic downturn which forced towns like Mataelpino to cut costs on its annual festivals and it has proven popular.The town holds the \u201cBoloencierro\u201d, a combination of the Spanish words for \u201cball\u201d and \u201cbull run\u201d, every August.Mirroring the example of Bunol, Mataelpino is helping six other Spanish towns to hold their own versions of the Boloencierro this year. The goal is to draw more visitors to its own event.\u201cThe municipality is trying to use this festival as a tourist draw,\u201d said Mataelpino mayor Javier de los Nietos.The town of Haro in the northern La Rioja wine-making region began the process this year to have its annual \u201cwine fight\u201d declared a \u201cFestival of International Interest\u201d. The event sees thousands of locals and tourists celebrate St Peter\u2019s day in June by throwing thousands of litres of wine at each other, with buckets, wineskins or water pistols.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Diego Urdaneta", "title": "Spanish towns seek to repeat success of Tomatina festival"}}
