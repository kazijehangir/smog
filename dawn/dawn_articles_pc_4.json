{"1281014": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "THEIR slim hopes stand extinguished. Sixteen men sentenced to death by military courts had turned to the Supreme Court as their last resort. All 16 have had their appeals rejected. A year after the Supreme Court upheld the 21st Amendment \u2014 an act carried out by parliament at the behest of the military \u2014 and acquiesced in the controversial changes to the Constitution, a smaller bench was always going to struggle to overturn the collective will of the full court, parliament and the country\u2019s establishment. While the 21st Amendment judgement left the narrowest of doors open for judicial review of military court verdicts, it would have required enormous courage and vigorous judicial activism for any individual sentenced to death by a military court to be able to win a reprieve no matter the obvious deficiencies in the standards of justice meted out. In truth, it may have also been an unfair burden to expect a few judges to stand between the collective, considered and determined will of all other institutions of the state. Signing off on death sentences handed down in the most opaque of manners is a grim day for justice in this country, but perhaps also an inevitable one given how little support those fighting for the centrality of fundamental rights have received since December 2014.Grim as the judicial verdict has been, the blight should not stay forever. At the heart of the 21st Amendment judgement were two things: one, the acceptance of the constitutionality of military courts, and, therefore, a largely hands-off approach to their working; and two, the recognition that military court trials for civilians accused of terrorism would be a temporary measure. The sunset of the sunset clause is nearing \u2014 in January the constitutional protection to the 21st Amendment military courts will expire. Parliament must stand resolute in its commitment to granting only a two-year life to military courts. Presumably, the dismissal of the 16 appeals will be used by advocates of military courts to argue that not only are the courts functioning within the law, but that the superior judiciary had found no flaw in the trials of accused militants. But the flaw is in their very conception, an anomalous court structure rammed through parliament in the cataclysmic aftermath of the APS Peshawar attack. Come January, military courts must be allowed to quietly expire and the overall judicial system made palatable again.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Dismissal of appeals"}}

The 3.5 million who ultimately entered Pakistan consisted of different classes of society.The majority were from rural areas and were mostly illiterate but skilled in agriculture, transport etc. They went into their relevant fields dislodging the locals by being more productive and demanding lower wages. Their labour turned barren and neglected land into lush fields producing vegetables and crops of sugarcane, wheat, corn, tobacco and cotton to mention a few. Other Afghans became labourers or started petty businesses selling whatever they could think of. Surprisingly not a single Afghan was seen begging on the streets; instead they would prefer to collect garbage and sift it for recyclable items to sell to the scrap dealer.The educated lot from Afghnaistan\u2019s urban areas used Pakistan as a transit camp to shift mostly to the West seeking political asylum with their cash and valuables to start businesses there.A big number opted to stay, some in camps while others obtained computerised national identity cards and started businesses and purchased land.

The work to be carried out on the three sites involves installing of water gauges at each dam site and setting up of a powerhouse to observe the water level and its flow, reviewing the stage-discharge relations at the dam sites and the tail water of the powerhouse, sampling and analysing of the sediment, topography, and review of geological maps and conditions. \u201cWhen the work plan by the CTG has already been submitted, delay on the part of the client in carrying out these site investigations and surveys is baffling,\u201d the Wapda official observed. He added that senior officials must give priority to work on the hydropower projects instead of \u201cdelaying assignments unnecessarily\u201d. Muhammad Nawaz Butt, general manager of the Diamer-Bhasha project, refused to comment on the issue. \u201cI am not authorised to speak on the matter,\u201d he replied. Wapda\u2019s director of public relations did not come up with the authority\u2019s version despite repeated calls and reminders over the last few days.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Khalid Hasnain", "title": "Wapda\u2019s inaction holds up work on three dam sites by Chinese firm"}}
{"1281114": {"date": "Updated August 31, 2016", "article": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakis\u00adtan Tehreek-i-Insaf\u2019s (PTI) long-awaited petition, asking for the disqualification of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and members of his family for their alleged involvement in the Panamagate scandal, met the same fate as the recently returned petition filed by the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI).The Supreme Court office on Tuesday handed the petition back to the party\u2019s Advocate-on-Record Chaud\u00adhry Akhtar Ali, a day after it was filed by senior counsel Naeem Bokhari. The objections raised by the court office were identical to the ones highlighted when the JI petition was returned, i.e. the petition, prima facie (on the face of it), appeared to be frivolous.The petition, which was filed in the name of PTI chairman Imran Khan, sought the disqualification of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, his son-in-law retired Captain Mohammad Safdar and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.\u201cThat this petition prima facie appears to be a frivolous petition within the contemplation of Order XVII Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980,\u201d explained the order issued by the registrar\u2019s office when the petition was returned.Under the Rule 5 of Order XVII, the registrar has the authority to refuse to receive a petition on the grounds that it has not been filed in accordance with the rules, or is frivolous, or contains scandalous matter.Under the same rules, the petitioner has the right to move an appeal within a fortnight of the petition\u2019s return, which would then be heard by a judge of the apex court in his chambers.\u201cAll these questions ought to have been decided by the court and not the registrar\u2019s office,\u201d senior PTI leader Ishaq Khakwani told Dawn.The registrar had violated the Constitution, he said, adding that the party\u2019s legal team was carefully analysing the registrar\u2019s objections and would soon file an appeal against the order.Mr Khakwani recalled that earlier scores of cases were entertained by the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) and such objections were never raised by the registrar\u2019s office. \u201cWe have every reason to believe that the registrar has acted in bad faith,\u201d he regretted.Separately, party spokesperson Naeemul Haq announced that a legal team headed by senior counsel Hamid Khan was in the process of finalising an appeal against the registrar\u2019s order, which would be moved soon.On Aug 27, the court office declined to accept a petition moved by JI emir Sirajul Haq, where he had asked the Supreme Court to declare the illegal transfer of national wealth for investments in offshore companies an offence under Section 9 of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO).On May 13, the Supreme Court returned a somewhat similar request from the federal government, asking the court to appoint a commission of inquiry to conduct a probe into the Panamagate affair, on the grounds that any such commission formed under the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act, 1956 would result in the constitution of a toothless commission that would serve no useful purpose, except bringing a bad name to the judiciary.The court had also declared the terms of reference \u2014 sent to it by the government under public pressure \u2014 \u201cwide and open-ended\u201d, saying that it might take years for such a commission to close its proceedings.On Tuesday, the court office informed the applicants that the petitioner was directly invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution \u2014 that deals with the \u2018enforcement of fundamental rights\u2019 \u2013 which is not permissible in light of the precedent laid down in the 1998 matter of Zulfikar Mehdi vs PIA.In that case, the apex court had interpreted the term \u2018public importance\u2019 and laid down that the expression should be viewed with reference to freedom and liberties guaranteed under the Constitution, their protection and the invasion of these rights in a manner which raises serious questions regarding their enforcement.The issues arising in a case cannot be considered questions of public importance if a decision on those issues only affects the rights of an individual or a group of individuals, the judgement had held.In its order, the registrar office also stated that the petitioner had approached the Supreme Court without first approaching an appropriate forum under the law, not did the petitioner provide any justification for not approaching any other forum.Similarly, the certificate provided by the petitioner alongside the petition did not fulfil the requirements of Rule 6 of Order XXV of the Supreme Court rules.This rule requires the applicant to state in clear terms whether the petitioner has moved the concerned high court for the same relief, and if so, what was the result.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Nasir Iqbal", "title": "SC returns PTI\u2019s \u2018frivolous\u2019 petition"}}

Jones will be president of ride-sharing at Uber, running local Uber services in every city, as well as marketing efforts and customer support.The hire underscores efforts by Uber, which has become the dominant on-demand ride service, to bolster its reputation and brand. Since 2009, the company has aggressively expanded to more than 450 cities, at times steamrolling regulators and launching campaigns against local lawmakers.Jones joined Target in 2012 to rejuvenate its brand and is credited with modernising the retailer's marketing efforts. He led campaigns including #MoreMusic, under which Target partnered with singer Gwen Stefani for a live video that aired during the Grammy Awards and released exclusive tracks from artists such as Adele, part of an effort to burnish Target's cool image.Prior to that, Jones led marketing for Gap Inc and worked for Coca-Cola and advertising firm McKinney.\u201cJones has a strong track record of driving the narrative around Target's brand, and will now try to do the same for Uber,\u201d said Mike Mannor, associate professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business.\u201cYou can surely expect to see stakeholders responding positively to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick taking steps to upgrade his middling in-house talent with proven professional chops.\u201d Kalanick said in a blog post that he and Jones met in February and \u201cwithin minutes we were debating how Uber could improve its reputation.\u201dKalanick said he wants to align Uber's marketing functions more closely with individual city operations and put more focus on customer service.Uber's global operations span dozens of countries and about 1.5 million drivers.Jones' hiring marks a change for Ryan Graves, who has been at Uber since 2010 and ran the company's operations and global expansion. Graves will give up some of those responsibilities but continue to work on Uber's delivery businesses, including UberEats and UberRush, as well as other projects, Kalanick said.Jones' exit is the latest in a string of executive departures from Target, which has made a series of management changes since last year.Among other moves, the big-box retailer appointed Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan to the newly created role of chief operating officer. It has also added new hires as it focuses on higher-margin categories such as baby and wellness products and revamps online sales.\n", "author": "Reuters", "title": "Uber hires senior Target executive to lead global operations"}}
