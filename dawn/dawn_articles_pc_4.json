{"1281014": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "THEIR slim hopes stand extinguished. Sixteen men sentenced to death by military courts had turned to the Supreme Court as their last resort. All 16 have had their appeals rejected. A year after the Supreme Court upheld the 21st Amendment \u2014 an act carried out by parliament at the behest of the military \u2014 and acquiesced in the controversial changes to the Constitution, a smaller bench was always going to struggle to overturn the collective will of the full court, parliament and the country\u2019s establishment. While the 21st Amendment judgement left the narrowest of doors open for judicial review of military court verdicts, it would have required enormous courage and vigorous judicial activism for any individual sentenced to death by a military court to be able to win a reprieve no matter the obvious deficiencies in the standards of justice meted out. In truth, it may have also been an unfair burden to expect a few judges to stand between the collective, considered and determined will of all other institutions of the state. Signing off on death sentences handed down in the most opaque of manners is a grim day for justice in this country, but perhaps also an inevitable one given how little support those fighting for the centrality of fundamental rights have received since December 2014.Grim as the judicial verdict has been, the blight should not stay forever. At the heart of the 21st Amendment judgement were two things: one, the acceptance of the constitutionality of military courts, and, therefore, a largely hands-off approach to their working; and two, the recognition that military court trials for civilians accused of terrorism would be a temporary measure. The sunset of the sunset clause is nearing \u2014 in January the constitutional protection to the 21st Amendment military courts will expire. Parliament must stand resolute in its commitment to granting only a two-year life to military courts. Presumably, the dismissal of the 16 appeals will be used by advocates of military courts to argue that not only are the courts functioning within the law, but that the superior judiciary had found no flaw in the trials of accused militants. But the flaw is in their very conception, an anomalous court structure rammed through parliament in the cataclysmic aftermath of the APS Peshawar attack. Come January, military courts must be allowed to quietly expire and the overall judicial system made palatable again.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "Dismissal of appeals"}}

The 3.5 million who ultimately entered Pakistan consisted of different classes of society.The majority were from rural areas and were mostly illiterate but skilled in agriculture, transport etc. They went into their relevant fields dislodging the locals by being more productive and demanding lower wages. Their labour turned barren and neglected land into lush fields producing vegetables and crops of sugarcane, wheat, corn, tobacco and cotton to mention a few. Other Afghans became labourers or started petty businesses selling whatever they could think of. Surprisingly not a single Afghan was seen begging on the streets; instead they would prefer to collect garbage and sift it for recyclable items to sell to the scrap dealer.The educated lot from Afghnaistan\u2019s urban areas used Pakistan as a transit camp to shift mostly to the West seeking political asylum with their cash and valuables to start businesses there.A big number opted to stay, some in camps while others obtained computerised national identity cards and started businesses and purchased land.

The work to be carried out on the three sites involves installing of water gauges at each dam site and setting up of a powerhouse to observe the water level and its flow, reviewing the stage-discharge relations at the dam sites and the tail water of the powerhouse, sampling and analysing of the sediment, topography, and review of geological maps and conditions. \u201cWhen the work plan by the CTG has already been submitted, delay on the part of the client in carrying out these site investigations and surveys is baffling,\u201d the Wapda official observed. He added that senior officials must give priority to work on the hydropower projects instead of \u201cdelaying assignments unnecessarily\u201d. Muhammad Nawaz Butt, general manager of the Diamer-Bhasha project, refused to comment on the issue. \u201cI am not authorised to speak on the matter,\u201d he replied. Wapda\u2019s director of public relations did not come up with the authority\u2019s version despite repeated calls and reminders over the last few days.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Khalid Hasnain", "title": "Wapda\u2019s inaction holds up work on three dam sites by Chinese firm"}}
{"1281114": {"date": "Updated August 31, 2016", "article": "ISLAMABAD: The Pakis\u00adtan Tehreek-i-Insaf\u2019s (PTI) long-awaited petition, asking for the disqualification of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif and members of his family for their alleged involvement in the Panamagate scandal, met the same fate as the recently returned petition filed by the Jamaat-i-Islami (JI).The Supreme Court office on Tuesday handed the petition back to the party\u2019s Advocate-on-Record Chaud\u00adhry Akhtar Ali, a day after it was filed by senior counsel Naeem Bokhari. The objections raised by the court office were identical to the ones highlighted when the JI petition was returned, i.e. the petition, prima facie (on the face of it), appeared to be frivolous.The petition, which was filed in the name of PTI chairman Imran Khan, sought the disqualification of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif, his son-in-law retired Captain Mohammad Safdar and Finance Minister Ishaq Dar.\u201cThat this petition prima facie appears to be a frivolous petition within the contemplation of Order XVII Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980,\u201d explained the order issued by the registrar\u2019s office when the petition was returned.Under the Rule 5 of Order XVII, the registrar has the authority to refuse to receive a petition on the grounds that it has not been filed in accordance with the rules, or is frivolous, or contains scandalous matter.Under the same rules, the petitioner has the right to move an appeal within a fortnight of the petition\u2019s return, which would then be heard by a judge of the apex court in his chambers.\u201cAll these questions ought to have been decided by the court and not the registrar\u2019s office,\u201d senior PTI leader Ishaq Khakwani told Dawn.The registrar had violated the Constitution, he said, adding that the party\u2019s legal team was carefully analysing the registrar\u2019s objections and would soon file an appeal against the order.Mr Khakwani recalled that earlier scores of cases were entertained by the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) and such objections were never raised by the registrar\u2019s office. \u201cWe have every reason to believe that the registrar has acted in bad faith,\u201d he regretted.Separately, party spokesperson Naeemul Haq announced that a legal team headed by senior counsel Hamid Khan was in the process of finalising an appeal against the registrar\u2019s order, which would be moved soon.On Aug 27, the court office declined to accept a petition moved by JI emir Sirajul Haq, where he had asked the Supreme Court to declare the illegal transfer of national wealth for investments in offshore companies an offence under Section 9 of the National Accountability Ordinance (NAO).On May 13, the Supreme Court returned a somewhat similar request from the federal government, asking the court to appoint a commission of inquiry to conduct a probe into the Panamagate affair, on the grounds that any such commission formed under the Pakistan Commission of Inquiry Act, 1956 would result in the constitution of a toothless commission that would serve no useful purpose, except bringing a bad name to the judiciary.The court had also declared the terms of reference \u2014 sent to it by the government under public pressure \u2014 \u201cwide and open-ended\u201d, saying that it might take years for such a commission to close its proceedings.On Tuesday, the court office informed the applicants that the petitioner was directly invoking the extraordinary jurisdiction of the Supreme Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution \u2014 that deals with the \u2018enforcement of fundamental rights\u2019 \u2013 which is not permissible in light of the precedent laid down in the 1998 matter of Zulfikar Mehdi vs PIA.In that case, the apex court had interpreted the term \u2018public importance\u2019 and laid down that the expression should be viewed with reference to freedom and liberties guaranteed under the Constitution, their protection and the invasion of these rights in a manner which raises serious questions regarding their enforcement.The issues arising in a case cannot be considered questions of public importance if a decision on those issues only affects the rights of an individual or a group of individuals, the judgement had held.In its order, the registrar office also stated that the petitioner had approached the Supreme Court without first approaching an appropriate forum under the law, not did the petitioner provide any justification for not approaching any other forum.Similarly, the certificate provided by the petitioner alongside the petition did not fulfil the requirements of Rule 6 of Order XXV of the Supreme Court rules.This rule requires the applicant to state in clear terms whether the petitioner has moved the concerned high court for the same relief, and if so, what was the result.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Nasir Iqbal", "title": "SC returns PTI\u2019s \u2018frivolous\u2019 petition"}}

Jones will be president of ride-sharing at Uber, running local Uber services in every city, as well as marketing efforts and customer support.The hire underscores efforts by Uber, which has become the dominant on-demand ride service, to bolster its reputation and brand. Since 2009, the company has aggressively expanded to more than 450 cities, at times steamrolling regulators and launching campaigns against local lawmakers.Jones joined Target in 2012 to rejuvenate its brand and is credited with modernising the retailer's marketing efforts. He led campaigns including #MoreMusic, under which Target partnered with singer Gwen Stefani for a live video that aired during the Grammy Awards and released exclusive tracks from artists such as Adele, part of an effort to burnish Target's cool image.Prior to that, Jones led marketing for Gap Inc and worked for Coca-Cola and advertising firm McKinney.\u201cJones has a strong track record of driving the narrative around Target's brand, and will now try to do the same for Uber,\u201d said Mike Mannor, associate professor at the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business.\u201cYou can surely expect to see stakeholders responding positively to Uber CEO Travis Kalanick taking steps to upgrade his middling in-house talent with proven professional chops.\u201d Kalanick said in a blog post that he and Jones met in February and \u201cwithin minutes we were debating how Uber could improve its reputation.\u201dKalanick said he wants to align Uber's marketing functions more closely with individual city operations and put more focus on customer service.Uber's global operations span dozens of countries and about 1.5 million drivers.Jones' hiring marks a change for Ryan Graves, who has been at Uber since 2010 and ran the company's operations and global expansion. Graves will give up some of those responsibilities but continue to work on Uber's delivery businesses, including UberEats and UberRush, as well as other projects, Kalanick said.Jones' exit is the latest in a string of executive departures from Target, which has made a series of management changes since last year.Among other moves, the big-box retailer appointed Chief Financial Officer John Mulligan to the newly created role of chief operating officer. It has also added new hires as it focuses on higher-margin categories such as baby and wellness products and revamps online sales.\n", "author": "Reuters", "title": "Uber hires senior Target executive to lead global operations"}}

The chief minister said after three months he would evaluate the performance of all officials and would replace, with the young blood, those who failed to deliver. He asked the officials concerned to explain why the problem of cotton pest attack had not been resolved. Similarly, he was eager to know why the people involved in manufacturing and distribution of spurious pesticides were not put in jails.

Following the company\u2019s repeated promises of \u201creleasing payments soon\u201d, the workers made a difficult decision earlier this year: they took their grievances to a labour court. However, with the legal battle yet to bear fruit, the expatriates with little money and borrowed time are quickly losing hope. \nResidence permits have expired because the fee required for their renewal has not been paid, laments a worker\n\nMost are still employed by the company as technical staff. Ali Shah*, who has been working as a bulldozer operator for the firm for a decade, says he is owed 35,000 Saudi riyals [approximately Rs980,000]. He claims that Pakistani workers are not the only ones facing such trouble at the United Seemac Co. \u201cThe company has a total of 500 employees of different nationalities, and all are in a similar situation. The trend of not paying salaries is new,\u201d he says, adding that he has not faced salary delays before. On average, workers have not been paid for nine to 16 months, though there are also some whose remunerations have reportedly been pending for 19 months. Despite the difficult circumstances, they continue to work in the hope that their dues will be paid and reside in cramped living quarters provided by the company. Their passports are in the employer\u2019s possession, and whether it is the death of a relative or an emergency, they cannot go back to Pakistan unless the employer returns their passport. Iqama question\nMany of the workers hold expired iqamas, the residence permits issued to expatriates who arrive in Saudi Arabia on an employment visa. Blaming the company for the expired permits, another staffer Basit Sheikh says: \u201cThe company has not paid a fee employers are required to submit for iqama renewal.\u201d Sheikh said he was recently arrested for seven days for not having a valid residence permit. A list compiled by a worker and seen by Dawn shows that of the 100 Pakistani employees working at the firm, 77 have their permits expired. \u201cWithout these permits, we cannot even get medical insurance. How can we possibly have money to go see a doctor, if we often do not even have money for food?\u201d asks Sheikh. In January, when the workers filed an official complaint with the labour court, Sheikh and another Pakistani worker represented the concerns of the complainants. According to documents seen by Dawn, the plaintiffs demanded that they be paid the pending salaries and their iqamas renewed. After three recorded hearings, the case was transferred to a higher court. \u201cThe representative of the company attended the last hearing; we found him uninterested in dealing with us [workers]. So now we are taking the case to a higher court,\u201d says Sheikh. Adding to the workers\u2019 distress is the fact that the company is holding their passports, making travel next to impossible. Saad Khan, an employee of the company for the past 12 years, says: \u201cIf I quit today, they will give me my passport and allow me to leave. But this would mean leaving behind my pending salary.\u201d For Khan, whose 11 pay cheques are owed to him, this is simply not an option. Company\u2019s problem\nThe plight of the workers at the construction firm is not unique. As has been widely reported, with oil revenues decreasing, the kingdom has cut down state spending, and construction firms have taken a hit. The company\u2019s general manager, Abu Mohammed, reportedly told online news organisation Middle East Eye that they were unable to pay employees because the Saudi government had failed to compensate the firm for completed contract work. Representatives of the firm could not be contacted despite several email and telephone communication attempts. In July, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Of\u00ad\u00adfi\u00ad\u00adce took notice when another construction firm had failed to pay 500 Pakistanis their dues. \u201c[The] Min\u00adis\u00ad\u00ad\u00adtry of Foreign Affairs and Pak\u00adistan Embassy in Riyadh are making every effort to resolve the difficulties being faced by Pakis\u00adtani nationals, working for Saad Group of Companies in Dam\u00adm\u00ad\u00adam\u2026,\u201d Foreign Office spokesman Nafees Zakaria had told Dawn. Non-payment of salaries affected 8,000 individuals at the Saad Group of Companies. Workers of the United Seemac Co feel that because they are emp\u00adloyed by a much smaller organisation, no one knows their situation. \u201cOne week ago we also went to Pakistan Embassy in Riyadh to lodge a complaint, but we did not receive any good response from them,\u201d said Sheikh. With a pending legal case and limited options, the employees continue to work for the firm. \u201cThey give us small sums of money sometimes. Just recently workers in Riyadh were given about 50 Saudi riyals [about Rs1,400] each,\u201d Khan says. This, however, is barely enough for him to feed himself, let alone support his family back in Pakistan. *Names have been changed to protect identity as the workers are not authorised to speak to journalistsAdditional reporting by Mahnoor BariPublished in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Fahad Naveed", "title": "Expatriate Pakistanis struggle as Saudi construction firm holds wages"}}

{"1281334": {"date": "Updated September 01, 2016", "article": "KARACHI: Thousands of Pakistani labourers working in Saudi Arabia fear arrest and hardship as they continue to work in the country with unpaid salaries and expired work permits. \u201cWe rush back to our quarters immediately after work,\u201d one worker tells Dawn in a telephone interview. \u201cWe are too scared of the police to step outside.\u201d At least 100 workers were thrust into uncertainty after their employer, the United Seemac Co., a construction company, allegedly failed to pay their salaries for several months. Following the company\u2019s repeated promises of \u201creleasing payments soon\u201d, the workers made a difficult decision earlier this year: they took their grievances to a labour court. However, with the legal battle yet to bear fruit, the expatriates with little money and borrowed time are quickly losing hope. \nResidence permits have expired because the fee required for their renewal has not been paid, laments a worker\n\nMost are still employed by the company as technical staff. Ali Shah*, who has been working as a bulldozer operator for the firm for a decade, says he is owed 35,000 Saudi riyals [approximately Rs980,000]. He claims that Pakistani workers are not the only ones facing such trouble at the United Seemac Co. \u201cThe company has a total of 500 employees of different nationalities, and all are in a similar situation. The trend of not paying salaries is new,\u201d he says, adding that he has not faced salary delays before. On average, workers have not been paid for nine to 16 months, though there are also some whose remunerations have reportedly been pending for 19 months. Despite the difficult circumstances, they continue to work in the hope that their dues will be paid and reside in cramped living quarters provided by the company. Their passports are in the employer\u2019s possession, and whether it is the death of a relative or an emergency, they cannot go back to Pakistan unless the employer returns their passport. Iqama question\nMany of the workers hold expired iqamas, the residence permits issued to expatriates who arrive in Saudi Arabia on an employment visa. Blaming the company for the expired permits, another staffer Basit Sheikh says: \u201cThe company has not paid a fee employers are required to submit for iqama renewal.\u201d Sheikh said he was recently arrested for seven days for not having a valid residence permit. A list compiled by a worker and seen by Dawn shows that of the 100 Pakistani employees working at the firm, 77 have their permits expired. \u201cWithout these permits, we cannot even get medical insurance. How can we possibly have money to go see a doctor, if we often do not even have money for food?\u201d asks Sheikh. In January, when the workers filed an official complaint with the labour court, Sheikh and another Pakistani worker represented the concerns of the complainants. According to documents seen by Dawn, the plaintiffs demanded that they be paid the pending salaries and their iqamas renewed. After three recorded hearings, the case was transferred to a higher court. \u201cThe representative of the company attended the last hearing; we found him uninterested in dealing with us [workers]. So now we are taking the case to a higher court,\u201d says Sheikh. Adding to the workers\u2019 distress is the fact that the company is holding their passports, making travel next to impossible.

As a result the village collects rights from firms that have used the Tomatina for its adverts, such as South Korean tech giant Samsung and Australian travel insurance provider Cover Moore.Each film shooting generates around 300,000 euros ($335,000) for the town from the rights, as well as from providing housing and food for the visiting film crews, according to the official web page of the Tomatina.Bunol city hall cooperates with other cities which want to hold its own version of the Tomatina for free because it provides publicity for the town and its festival, said Perez.\u201cAt the end of the day what everyone wants is to go to the original version, which is ours, so it is to our advantage,\u201d he added.Versions of the Tomatina have been held annually or as one-off events in Colombia, Chile, Cuba, India, South Korea and the United States.\u201cWe always try to cooperate with anyone who wants, so that the image of the Tomatina is reinforced abroad,\u201d said Perez.Giant ball and wine Other Spanish towns with unusual festivals are seeking to copy Bunol\u2019s success.The tiny town of Mataelpino near Madrid registered its annual fiesta, dubbed the \u201cBoloencierro\u201d, which involves pitting daredevils against a giant 200-kilogram polystyrene ball as it gathers steam heading downhill towards the village bullring.The ball \u2014 three metres in diameter \u2014 has since 2010 replaced bulls used in a traditional bull run in which daredevils raced ahead of a pack of half-tonne fighting bulls along a similar route. The risk is real \u2014 the ball has injured several participants.The switch was motivated by Spain\u2019s economic downturn which forced towns like Mataelpino to cut costs on its annual festivals and it has proven popular.The town holds the \u201cBoloencierro\u201d, a combination of the Spanish words for \u201cball\u201d and \u201cbull run\u201d, every August.Mirroring the example of Bunol, Mataelpino is helping six other Spanish towns to hold their own versions of the Boloencierro this year. The goal is to draw more visitors to its own event.\u201cThe municipality is trying to use this festival as a tourist draw,\u201d said Mataelpino mayor Javier de los Nietos.The town of Haro in the northern La Rioja wine-making region began the process this year to have its annual \u201cwine fight\u201d declared a \u201cFestival of International Interest\u201d. The event sees thousands of locals and tourists celebrate St Peter\u2019s day in June by throwing thousands of litres of wine at each other, with buckets, wineskins or water pistols.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Diego Urdaneta", "title": "Spanish towns seek to repeat success of Tomatina festival"}}
{"1281234": {"date": "September 01, 2016", "article": "KARACHI: Academic activities were suspended at eight major public sector universities in the province on Wednesday in response to a call for strike given by the Sindh chapter of the Federation of All Pakistan Universities Academic Staff Association (Fapuasa).At Karachi University (KU) teachers addressed a press conference after boycott of classes to vent anger and frustration over prolonged financial crisis the university had been facing and the way the provincial government had been handling affairs at universities.They warned the government of a \u2018strong agitation\u2019 soon after Eid if the government did not release the Rs350m grant it had announced last year for the university.Listing a number of other demands, teachers, which included the society\u2019s office-bearers as well as members of the university\u2019s statutory bodies, called upon the government to immediately withdraw what they described as \u2018unilateral amendments\u2019 to the Sindh Universities Law 2013, and either activate the provincial higher education commission in consultation with senior teachers or abolish the body altogether.The demands which were put forward to the provincial government included making appointments to all key administrative posts through a selection board, removing retired administrative officers, making regular appointments to all posts including that of the vice chancellor (who was currently working on ad hoc basis), initiating meaningful investigation into financial malpractices on the campus, adopting a uniform policy for teachers and non-teaching staff of all universities, increasing KU grant to Rs1bn and payment of leave encashment to all KU employees before Eid, which, they said, was being paid to staff at other universities.\u201cThis has now become an issue of discrimination against KU. The government must pay leave encashment to all university employees before Eid,\u201d president Kuts Dr Shakeel Farooqi demanded.The university would be shut if the issues were not addressed, he warned.\u201cIt\u2019s no more possible to continue academic activities in an environment lacking requisite paraphernalia; the university\u2019s physical infrastructure badly needs repair, labs are functioning without a whole set of chemicals and proper equipment while no funds are available to purchase research journals for libraries,\u201d he explained in response to a question.Teachers also demanded the Higher Education Commission (HEC) increase university grant and pay full salary including the raise announced by the government. \u201cPresently, the deficit the university faces under the head of staff salaries is Rs800m. In other words, the government only pays eight months\u2019 salaries to KU staff. The rest is to be arranged by the university itself,\u201d he said.On the autonomous status of universities, he said teachers had been protesting against the controversial amendments for the past three years but to no avail. It was the assemblies, he observed, which made the universities independent bodies and agreed to have an apolitical dignitary as chancellor (governor) as a representative of the federal government. \u201cThis has been so because a large chunk of university grant comes from the federal government. But, when a political worker or a person perceived as a representative of the establishment becomes the governor and provincial government brings a law that serves its own vested interests, the entire system at universities is ruined, as has been happening,\u201d he noted.On the role of provincial HEC, it was pointed out that since the Punjab HEC had decided to work with the federal HEC, Sindh was now left alone.Meanwhile, vice president of the Fapuasa-centre Dr Kalimullah Bareech supported the Kuts stance. \u201cWe support all universities of Sindh in their struggle and demand the government and the HEC address their concerns. Otherwise a nationwide strike will be observed at universities,\u201d he said.HYDERABAD: Teachers and non-teaching staff boycotted academic activities the Sindh University in response to the Sindh chapter of Fapuasa\u2019s call. The protest was later joined by the Sindh Universities Officers Federation as well.Academic and non-academic staff boycotted work and participated in a demonstration which was led by Fapuasa\u2019s Sindh chapter president Dr Shahnawaz Talpur along with the federation\u2019s provincial general secretary Dr Farid Ahmed Memon and others. The leaders said that amendments suggested by Fapuasa should be made part of the law and opposed interference by Sindh government and Higher Education Commission (HEC) in the universities\u2019 affairs. They demanded that all appointments in the universities should be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in the universities\u2019 regulations. The Mehran University Officers\u2019 Welfare Association also claimed in a statement that officers and staff boycotted work in protest against appointment of retirees to administrative positions. They demanded removal of such officers and staged a sit-in. Later, the Mehran university employees association also joined the protest, it said. The protesters\u2019 office-bearers said that Sindh government had appointed registrar of Mehran University in violation of set procedure.

Russia is appealing the Swiss-based International Paralympics Committee\u2019s decision this month to ban its athletes from the Sept. 7-18 competition. After losing before the Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne last week, Russia took its case to the Swiss Federal Court. The tribunal decided that the Russian delegation had not done enough to justify an immediate lifting of the ban on its athletes in Rio, a court statement said. \u201cThe Russian Paralympic Committee would have needed to demonstrate it had fulfilled its obligations in upholding... anti-doping protocols, and that its interests in an immediate lifting of its suspension outweigh the International Paralympics Committee\u2019s interests in fighting doping and in the integrity of athletics. It did not succeed in this in any way,\u201d it said. The court is limited to ruling on procedural matters. Earlier on Wednesday, Russia\u2019s Paralympic Committee chief Vladimir Lukin said the country will hold a two-day competition next week for its paralympic squad, coinciding with the official Games start in Brazil. \u201cWe\u2019re planning to hold on September 7-8 a series of tournaments for the country\u2019s Paralympic athletes at the training bases in the Moscow region,\u201d R-Sport news agency quoted Lukin as saying. Last week Russian President Vladimir Putin lashed out against the ban on the country\u2019s Paralympians, calling the decision \u201coutside the law, morality, humanity\u201d. Putin pledged that Russia instead would organise competitions for the banned Paralympians \u201cto show all their skills\u201d. A Kremlin spokesman said Wednesday that it was still to be decided if Putin would attend the event. Russia\u2019s Olympic squad narrowly escaped a total ban from the Rio Games, but its track-and-field team was suspended over evidence of state-sponsored drug cheating and corruption in the country.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Agencies", "title": "Swiss court holds fire on Russian paralympic athletes\u2019 Rio ban"}}

As a result the village collects rights from firms that have used the Tomatina for its adverts, such as South Korean tech giant Samsung and Australian travel insurance provider Cover Moore.Each film shooting generates around 300,000 euros ($335,000) for the town from the rights, as well as from providing housing and food for the visiting film crews, according to the official web page of the Tomatina.Bunol city hall cooperates with other cities which want to hold its own version of the Tomatina for free because it provides publicity for the town and its festival, said Perez.\u201cAt the end of the day what everyone wants is to go to the original version, which is ours, so it is to our advantage,\u201d he added.Versions of the Tomatina have been held annually or as one-off events in Colombia, Chile, Cuba, India, South Korea and the United States.\u201cWe always try to cooperate with anyone who wants, so that the image of the Tomatina is reinforced abroad,\u201d said Perez.Giant ball and wine Other Spanish towns with unusual festivals are seeking to copy Bunol\u2019s success.The tiny town of Mataelpino near Madrid registered its annual fiesta, dubbed the \u201cBoloencierro\u201d, which involves pitting daredevils against a giant 200-kilogram polystyrene ball as it gathers steam heading downhill towards the village bullring.The ball \u2014 three metres in diameter \u2014 has since 2010 replaced bulls used in a traditional bull run in which daredevils raced ahead of a pack of half-tonne fighting bulls along a similar route. The risk is real \u2014 the ball has injured several participants.The switch was motivated by Spain\u2019s economic downturn which forced towns like Mataelpino to cut costs on its annual festivals and it has proven popular.The town holds the \u201cBoloencierro\u201d, a combination of the Spanish words for \u201cball\u201d and \u201cbull run\u201d, every August.Mirroring the example of Bunol, Mataelpino is helping six other Spanish towns to hold their own versions of the Boloencierro this year. The goal is to draw more visitors to its own event.\u201cThe municipality is trying to use this festival as a tourist draw,\u201d said Mataelpino mayor Javier de los Nietos.The town of Haro in the northern La Rioja wine-making region began the process this year to have its annual \u201cwine fight\u201d declared a \u201cFestival of International Interest\u201d. The event sees thousands of locals and tourists celebrate St Peter\u2019s day in June by throwing thousands of litres of wine at each other, with buckets, wineskins or water pistols.Published in Dawn September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Diego Urdaneta", "title": "Spanish towns seek to repeat success of Tomatina festival"}}

The government must pay leave encashment to all university employees before Eid,\u201d president Kuts Dr Shakeel Farooqi demanded.The university would be shut if the issues were not addressed, he warned.\u201cIt\u2019s no more possible to continue academic activities in an environment lacking requisite paraphernalia; the university\u2019s physical infrastructure badly needs repair, labs are functioning without a whole set of chemicals and proper equipment while no funds are available to purchase research journals for libraries,\u201d he explained in response to a question.Teachers also demanded the Higher Education Commission (HEC) increase university grant and pay full salary including the raise announced by the government. \u201cPresently, the deficit the university faces under the head of staff salaries is Rs800m. In other words, the government only pays eight months\u2019 salaries to KU staff. The rest is to be arranged by the university itself,\u201d he said.On the autonomous status of universities, he said teachers had been protesting against the controversial amendments for the past three years but to no avail. It was the assemblies, he observed, which made the universities independent bodies and agreed to have an apolitical dignitary as chancellor (governor) as a representative of the federal government. \u201cThis has been so because a large chunk of university grant comes from the federal government. But, when a political worker or a person perceived as a representative of the establishment becomes the governor and provincial government brings a law that serves its own vested interests, the entire system at universities is ruined, as has been happening,\u201d he noted.On the role of provincial HEC, it was pointed out that since the Punjab HEC had decided to work with the federal HEC, Sindh was now left alone.Meanwhile, vice president of the Fapuasa-centre Dr Kalimullah Bareech supported the Kuts stance. \u201cWe support all universities of Sindh in their struggle and demand the government and the HEC address their concerns. Otherwise a nationwide strike will be observed at universities,\u201d he said.HYDERABAD: Teachers and non-teaching staff boycotted academic activities the Sindh University in response to the Sindh chapter of Fapuasa\u2019s call. The protest was later joined by the Sindh Universities Officers Federation as well.Academic and non-academic staff boycotted work and participated in a demonstration which was led by Fapuasa\u2019s Sindh chapter president Dr Shahnawaz Talpur along with the federation\u2019s provincial general secretary Dr Farid Ahmed Memon and others. The leaders said that amendments suggested by Fapuasa should be made part of the law and opposed interference by Sindh government and Higher Education Commission (HEC) in the universities\u2019 affairs. They demanded that all appointments in the universities should be made in accordance with the procedure laid down in the universities\u2019 regulations. The Mehran University Officers\u2019 Welfare Association also claimed in a statement that officers and staff boycotted work in protest against appointment of retirees to administrative positions. They demanded removal of such officers and staged a sit-in. Later, the Mehran university employees association also joined the protest, it said.

Chairing a workshop on \u2018Prospects of GM Cotton in Punjab: Opportunities and Challenges\u2019 at his 90-Shahr-e-Quaid-i-Azam office, Chief Minister Shahbaz Sharif  criticized top officials of the agriculture department, heads of research institutes and agriculture universities for extensively attending training programmes abroad on government expense and delivering nothing to improve the productivity of cash crops.The chief minister grilled the hierarchy of agriculture department, research institutions and universities in the presence of other top government officials, agriculture experts, farmers and media.On the invitation of the chief minister, a couple of farmers and farm experts highlighted the problems the farmers are facing and their exploitation at the hands of government institutions. The chief minister said after three months he would evaluate the performance of all officials and would replace, with the young blood, those who failed to deliver. He asked the officials concerned to explain why the problem of cotton pest attack had not been resolved. Similarly, he was eager to know why the people involved in manufacturing and distribution of spurious pesticides were not put in jails. He said Pakistan was spending huge amount on cotton import from India and Egypt, adding 1,300 ginning factories, a large number of looms and export-oriented garments industry were at verge of closure because of \ncotton crop failure. He put a question to the research bodies why they could not introduce better-yielding varieties.Citing an example of official lethargy, Shahbaz Sharif said the government of Indian Punjab had gifted him a modern combined harvester during his visit there a few years ago. He said he had asked the officials concerned to make arrangements to copy and market the machine for the benefit of local farmers. He said he was shocked to learn after a couple of years that there was no progress over the issue. When a senior government official, while giving presentation on the cotton crisis, admitted that sucking pests had badly hit the crop last year, the chief minister intervened and asked him to explain the failure to use indigenous technology.The official said against the growing use of Monsento\u2019s seed technology in Pakistan, the scientists working in local research labs had developed better quality of genes resisting cotton pests.Asked why that improved version of cotton seed was not used last year, the official said procedural issues had delayed its introduction.   Warning the irrigation officials, the chief minister said theft of canal water was equal to defaming the Punjab government and asked the officials to control the menace. Provincial Agriculture Minister Dr Farrukh Javed admitted the cotton crop had suffered a huge loss in 2015 because of possible factors of climate change, seed failure and redundant gene in seed but claimed this year the crop was good.\u201cBeing the minister I take responsibility of cotton failure to move forward with identification of mistakes\u201d he said.The minister said negotiations skills would be developed to negotiate pro-farmers deals with multinational seed companies.Javed said the main concern of the department was to provide latest technologies to small farmer having less than 12.5 acre holdings.Winding up the debate which had three technical sessions, Secretary Agriculture Muhammad Mahmood gave five recommendations for betterment in cotton crop.The recommendations were to introduce GM cotton technology, protect farmers\u2019 rights, provide enabling environment to the private sector, introduce legal and regulatory regime and transform cotton seed sector.Published in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Faisal Ali Ghumman", "title": "Productivity of cash crops: CM snubs officials for slackness"}}

A three-judge bench headed by Justice Amir Hani Muslim passed the directive while hearing an appeal filed by NAB against an accountability court\u2019s order for not granting the remand of a suspect in a corruption case involving a sum of Rs400,000. At the outset, when a deputy prosecutor turned up with a report on NAB\u2019s powers the bench asked him about the financial value of embezzlement or corruption that fell under the bureau\u2019s standard to prepare a reference and initiate probe. The prosecutor said that NAB was looking into old inquires that had been transferred to it from other investigation departments. However, in response to another query by the bench, he conceded that the director general of NAB had authorised these inquires since he was empowered to do so. Justice Muslim deplored that instead of laying its hands on the big fish the NAB was approving and persuing the cases amounting around Rs200,000, adding that there was hardly any difference between the anti-corruption department, the Federal Investigation Agency and NAB. He said people were complaining against NAB because it was only laying its hands on petty suspects and putting them in prisons, and added that the prime duty of the anti-corruption organisation was to take up mega-corruption cases and stop them.

Following the company\u2019s repeated promises of \u201creleasing payments soon\u201d, the workers made a difficult decision earlier this year: they took their grievances to a labour court. However, with the legal battle yet to bear fruit, the expatriates with little money and borrowed time are quickly losing hope. \nResidence permits have expired because the fee required for their renewal has not been paid, laments a worker\n\nMost are still employed by the company as technical staff. Ali Shah*, who has been working as a bulldozer operator for the firm for a decade, says he is owed 35,000 Saudi riyals [approximately Rs980,000]. He claims that Pakistani workers are not the only ones facing such trouble at the United Seemac Co. \u201cThe company has a total of 500 employees of different nationalities, and all are in a similar situation. The trend of not paying salaries is new,\u201d he says, adding that he has not faced salary delays before. On average, workers have not been paid for nine to 16 months, though there are also some whose remunerations have reportedly been pending for 19 months. Despite the difficult circumstances, they continue to work in the hope that their dues will be paid and reside in cramped living quarters provided by the company. Their passports are in the employer\u2019s possession, and whether it is the death of a relative or an emergency, they cannot go back to Pakistan unless the employer returns their passport. Iqama question\nMany of the workers hold expired iqamas, the residence permits issued to expatriates who arrive in Saudi Arabia on an employment visa. Blaming the company for the expired permits, another staffer Basit Sheikh says: \u201cThe company has not paid a fee employers are required to submit for iqama renewal.\u201d Sheikh said he was recently arrested for seven days for not having a valid residence permit. A list compiled by a worker and seen by Dawn shows that of the 100 Pakistani employees working at the firm, 77 have their permits expired. \u201cWithout these permits, we cannot even get medical insurance. How can we possibly have money to go see a doctor, if we often do not even have money for food?\u201d asks Sheikh. In January, when the workers filed an official complaint with the labour court, Sheikh and another Pakistani worker represented the concerns of the complainants. According to documents seen by Dawn, the plaintiffs demanded that they be paid the pending salaries and their iqamas renewed. After three recorded hearings, the case was transferred to a higher court. \u201cThe representative of the company attended the last hearing; we found him uninterested in dealing with us [workers]. So now we are taking the case to a higher court,\u201d says Sheikh. Adding to the workers\u2019 distress is the fact that the company is holding their passports, making travel next to impossible. Saad Khan, an employee of the company for the past 12 years, says: \u201cIf I quit today, they will give me my passport and allow me to leave. But this would mean leaving behind my pending salary.\u201d For Khan, whose 11 pay cheques are owed to him, this is simply not an option. Company\u2019s problem\nThe plight of the workers at the construction firm is not unique. As has been widely reported, with oil revenues decreasing, the kingdom has cut down state spending, and construction firms have taken a hit. The company\u2019s general manager, Abu Mohammed, reportedly told online news organisation Middle East Eye that they were unable to pay employees because the Saudi government had failed to compensate the firm for completed contract work. Representatives of the firm could not be contacted despite several email and telephone communication attempts. In July, Pakistan\u2019s Foreign Of\u00ad\u00adfi\u00ad\u00adce took notice when another construction firm had failed to pay 500 Pakistanis their dues. \u201c[The] Min\u00adis\u00ad\u00ad\u00adtry of Foreign Affairs and Pak\u00adistan Embassy in Riyadh are making every effort to resolve the difficulties being faced by Pakis\u00adtani nationals, working for Saad Group of Companies in Dam\u00adm\u00ad\u00adam\u2026,\u201d Foreign Office spokesman Nafees Zakaria had told Dawn. Non-payment of salaries affected 8,000 individuals at the Saad Group of Companies. Workers of the United Seemac Co feel that because they are emp\u00adloyed by a much smaller organisation, no one knows their situation. \u201cOne week ago we also went to Pakistan Embassy in Riyadh to lodge a complaint, but we did not receive any good response from them,\u201d said Sheikh. With a pending legal case and limited options, the employees continue to work for the firm. \u201cThey give us small sums of money sometimes. Just recently workers in Riyadh were given about 50 Saudi riyals [about Rs1,400] each,\u201d Khan says. This, however, is barely enough for him to feed himself, let alone support his family back in Pakistan. *Names have been changed to protect identity as the workers are not authorised to speak to journalistsAdditional reporting by Mahnoor BariPublished in Dawn, September 1st, 2016\n", "author": "Fahad Naveed", "title": "Expatriate Pakistanis struggle as Saudi construction firm holds wages"}}

During a meeting of the committee in July, Col Qaiser Khattaq, who is said to be overseeing the Karachi operation, said that an international human rights organisation had endorsed the operation. Mr Babar had challenged the Rangers\u2019 claim and asked Col Khattaq to submit a copy of the report in the committee\u2019s next meeting. However, when the committee met on Wednesday, representatives from Pakistan Rangers were absent. In a letter to the committee, the Rangers said its representatives would not be available until November \u201cdue to prevailing law and order situation of the Metropolitan city\u201d.

It recommended DNA tests of all such bodies and reiterated its call for adoption of draft legislation to \u201crein in state agencies\u201d. The debate was triggered when Quetta\u2019s DIG Crimes Shakeel Ahmed Durrani informed the meeting that 52 bodies had been found dumped in \u2018A areas\u2019 of Balochistan over the past two years. The meeting learnt that cases were not being investigated as no-one had come forward to lodge a report with the police. While local police were in charge of \u2018A areas\u2019, their jurisdiction ended in \u2018B areas\u2019 which came under the jurisdiction of Frontier Corps, the committee was informed. Mr Babar said the admission that no-one had lodged a report with the police was stinging indictment of state institutions. \u201cThis is a vote of no-confidence in the state machinery and the system of justice,\u201d said Mr Babar while warning against consequences of state apathy towards the plight of the people of Balochistan. He said the report of dumping of mutilated bodies was highly alarming as figures pertained only to \u2018A areas\u2019 where police were deployed. \u201cGod alone knows how many bodies of unfortunate victims were found dumped in \u2018B areas\u2019 of Balochistan,\u201d the senator said and demanded a complete report on the \u201ckilling and dumping cases\u201d in all areas of the province year-wise at the next meeting.

Warner lauded his team-mates for their six-wicket win against Sri Lanka in the fourth ODI on Wednesday, which handed the tourists an unassailable 3-1 lead in the five-match series. Australia easily chased down their target of 213 in just 31 overs as Aaron Finch smashed 55 off 19 balls while George Bailey hit an unbeaten 90 after Sri Lanka struggled to 212 all out in their 50 overs. Warner, whose side suffered their first Test whitewash against the hosts last month, said the sluggish pitches were not ideal for ODI cricket. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to gain momentum when the wickets prepared are like this,\u201d Warner, who took over as captain after the second ODI while Steve Smith is rested, told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit disappointing from our point of view because it\u2019s not the way we like to play. We like to play an aggressive brand of cricket. We like to entertain the crowd.\u201d England recorded the highest ODI score in history on Tuesday \u2014 444 for 3 in 50 overs against Pakistan at Trent Bridge \u2014 while Australia and Sri Lanka have struggled to get past 200 in their series. \u201cWhen you see games like the England match the other night \u2014 that\u2019s what I love about cricket. I love that kind of atmosphere, and that\u2019s why as a youngster I went to watch the game. \u201cBut if you come here and you play five games like that, on wickets like they have here at the moment, it is going to be very, very tough to draw a big crowd all the time,\u201d Warner said. Australia, ranked number one in the 50-over format, finally seemed to master the slow Sri Lankan tracks after scraping past the hosts in their first two victories in Colombo and Dambulla. Finch, who equalled the record for the fastest 50 by an Australian \u2014 achieved in 18 balls \u2014 gave the visitors a rocket start. \u201cIt\u2019s always awesome to have one of your players go off like that and for me it is more of a watching tour to be honest,\u201d said Warner. \u201cI\u2019ve been up the other end or in the dugout watching the guys go about it.

While there were 1.7 million registered Afghan refugees in Pakistan, according to a 2005 count, the actual number of undocumented Afghans residing in this country has been open to conjecture. Officially, we are told there are 1m here.But according to the Fata Ana\u00adlysis and Strategy Team (Fast), an intelligence and information collation and analysis wing under the Fata Secretariat Law & Order Department, between 2010 and mid-August, 2016, 16.49m undocumented Afghans entered Pakistan via Torkham border crossing alone \u2014 that is 51.6pc of Afghanistan\u2019s current approximate 32m population.Read: Leaving Pakistan, 'our second home'What is more surprising, however, is that 20.28m undocumented Afghans went back to Afghanistan during the same period, indicating a disturbing trend of an unchecked and unregulated flow of human traffic on both sides of the border.But while the authorities have had no clue about the identity, purpose, nature and number of their frequent two-way sojourns, the data does seem to suggest that economic opportunities and other needs, rather than security, were the main motivation for the Afghans\u2019 stay in Pakistan.\nSituation may change once all the new posts become operational\n\n\u201cClumped together, the data would surpass Afghanistan\u2019s existing population,\u201d a senior government official in Fata said. \u201cBut what we see here is a different phenomenon. The undocumented Afghans frequently travelled between Pakistan and Afghanistan,\u201d the official said, suggesting that in numerous cases the same Afghan nationals may have come and gone back multiple times. \u201cThere can be two reasons for this: either they have familial stakes in both countries, or they have economic stakes. The fact that they frequently visited their country indicates they were not deterred by the security environment there,\u201d the official said, requesting not to be named.\u201cThis is a security nightmare,\u201d another senior government official said. \u201cIf this is the figure for just one border crossing, who knows how many entered Pakistan from the other border crossings?\u201d the official asked, also requesting anonymity.

The other seven are: Arandu (Chit\u00adral), Gursal (Bajaur), Nawa Pass (Mohmand), Kharlachi (Kur\u00adram), Ghulam Khan (North Waziristan), Angoor Adda (South Waziristan) and Chaman (Balochistan). The military said on Thursday they would be building 18 proper border crossings with Afghan\u00adistan to regulate cross-border move\u00adment. Additionally, there are scores of unfrequented rou\u00adtes along the 2,430km border between Pakistan and Afghan\u00adistan, used mostly by smugglers. It was, however, not immediately known if authorities at the other crossings with Afghanistan also maintained similar record of cross-border movement.Pakistan has recently undertaken to build border gates at all eight crossings as part of the border-management plan, including the construction of a trench on Afghanistan\u2019s border with Balo\u00adch\u00adistan. It has since operationalised one at Torkham after a violent standoff with Kabul in June 2016.Officials in the Afghan Refugees Commissionerate acknowledge that while the number of registered Afghans living in Pakistan is pretty much documented and accounted for, no one has a clue as to the number of undocumented Afghans in this country. The one million figure being dished out routinely, they say, was a guesstimate at best. Officials say that they estimate there could be 2m undocumented Afghans in Karachi alone, followed by a million each in Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan. This would put the number of undocumented Afghans in Pakistan at five million.The 2005 census for the Afghans, on the basis of which Proof of Registration (PoR) cards were issued to the registered Afghans, does not take into account the number of undocumented Afghans, nor does it take into account their population growth rate. Aid agencies estimate that the documented Afghans add an average of 65,000 to 70,000 children annually to their existing population. This means that the population of documented refugees has risen by another 700,000 since 2005, officials say, making their total population standing at 2.2m.The document prepared by Fast gives some astounding figures based on cross-border movement. The document shows that between 2010 and 2016 (mid-August), a total of 908,799 Afghans arrived in Pakistan on valid travel documents. As against this, a total of 1,205,871 Afghans travelled back to their country. Unregulated flow\nIt is, however, the inflow and outflow of undocumented Afghans that has been a source of major concern for government and security agencies. The inflow and outflow of undocumented Afghans to and from Pakistan at Torkham never dropped below the one million mark. Starting from 2010, when a total of 1.7m undocumented Afghans poured into Pakistan via Torkham, 2.1m went back. This figure, however, sharply rose in 2011 and 2012, when the number of undocumented Afghans dramatically shot up to 3.57 and 3.58m respectively. An equal number of these undocumented Afghans went back to their country during the same corresponding period.The number of incoming undocumented Afghans, however, came down to 2.3m and 2m in 2013, 2014, and 2015 respectively, with the number of outgoing undocumented Afghans suggested an upward trend in 2013 with 3.6m returning home. The figure of undocumented returning Afghans, however, registered a steady decline from 2014, from 2.6m to 2.5m in 2015 and to 1.5m by mid-August, 2016. The total number of undocumented Afghans having crossed back to their homeland via Torkham in the last six-and-a-half years, thus, comes to 20.28m.Since the enforcement of border management at Torkham, banning the entry of undocumented Afghans into Pakistan, their number has dropped from 2m and 1.9m in April and May, 2016, respectively, to zero in July and August, documents show. This contrasts with the number of Afghans travelling to Pakistan with valid documents via Torkham from 13,175 in July to 15,673 by August 22, 2016. Repatriation concerns\nPakistan granted another six months\u2019 extension in stay for the documented Afghans till Dec 31, 2016 and undocumented persons till Nov 15, 2016. The ministry of states and frontier regions has prepared an action plan to facilitate what it calls voluntary repatriation of Afghans to their homeland. A donor conference on Afghanistan due on Oct 5, 2016 in Brussels, jointly hosted by the EU and Kabul, bringing together up to 70 countries and 30 international organisations and agencies, will, among other things, discuss the rehabilitation of returning refugees. So far, as part of the repatriation plan, 140,000 undocumented Afghans and 89,000 documented Afghan refugees have returned home. Officials are optimistic that by Dec 31, 2016, they would have surpassed the target of repatriating 200,000 Afghan refugees. Part of the National Action Plan, the repatriation of Afghan refugees and undocumented Afghans may take more time than envisaged, officials say, partly due to concerns that forced repatriation or alleged harassment of the Afghans in Pakistan may further strain the already strained relations between Kabul and Islamabad, and partly due to non-availability or non-provision of required funding to speed up the process. With Islamabad blowing hot and cold on the issue, there already is talk in official circles in Islamabad of granting yet another extension to the Afghan refugees beyond the Dec 31, 2016, deadline till Dec 2017 to repatriate them with honour and dignity. Some officials, however, acknowledge that while it was never realistically possible to repatriate all Afghans \u2014 documented and undocumented \u2014 during the current extension expiring this December, the government should have at least done its homework before announcing the deadline. \u201cThe cut-off date was announced without much homework.

If the temperature crosses eight degrees, the cold chain is disturbed and the vaccine is spoiled.In February 2015, vaccines sufficient to protect around 1.3 million children against five diseases were spoiled in a store of the Expanded Programme on Immunisation (EPI) located at the National Institute of Health (NIH) Islamabad after the cold chain could not be maintained at the specific temperature.

The issue came to the fore when authorities detected two bogus appointments in Orakzai Agency about three years ago. After investigations, the two appointments were found fake and the employees were dismissed. No action has been taken against any teacher so far. \nSources say 159 teachers have been appointed in tribal areas without approval of competent authority\n\nThe documents show that 31 fake appointments were made in Orakzai Agency, 37 in South Waziristan, 30 in Mohmand, 18 in Khyber, 10 in Bajaur, 13 in Kurram, five in North Waziristan, four in Frontier Region (FR) Kohat, two in FR Lakki Marwat, two in FR Tank, four in FR Peshawar and two in FR Dera Ismail Khan. One person got appointed four daughters in Mohmand Agency while another got appointed his two daughters as teachers. The list carries names of three brothers, who had been appointed as SS teachers in Khyber Agency. Sources said that after dismissal from jobs, the two teachers made hue and cry and disclosed more fake appointments. After receiving complaints, the Directorate of Education Fata deputed a senior officer to conduct inquiry into the matter. After scrutinising the record, it was found that a total 159 teachers had been appointed in Grade-16 fraudulently. The documents revealed that the alleged bogus appointments were made in 2008 and continued till 2014. The last teacher was appointed without the approval of the appointing authority in March 2014.Procedure for appointment of government employees in Grade-16 and above is that the department concerned asks the provincial commission to conduct test and interview for the desired positions. After conducting test and interviews, the commission shortlists successful candidates and then chief secretary signs appointment letters of the respective candidates. Officials said that the inquiry committee approached both offices [commission and chief secretary] which expressed ignorance about those appointments. \u201cNeither the commission nor the chief secretary office confirms these appointments,\u201d said an official in the secretariat. The director education was approached for comments but he was on leave while another official said that he had not been authorised to talk to media about the matter. He said that inquiry was underway and comments at that stage would be premature. Sources said that another committee had been set up to fix responsibility against the officials, who had made those appointments, in the light of the report. The committee has begun inquiry and sought record of more than 2200 SS teachers from the Directorate of Education Fata. The directorate had yet to furnish required record to the committee, they said.\u201cThe number of bogus appointments may exceed 200,\u201d said a relevant official. He added that it might be handiwork of some officials inside the directorate. Sources said that efforts were being made to sweep the matter under the carpet. They said that fate of the issue might be similar to the previous inquiries conducted in different line departments.Officials said that recently an inquiry committee had unearthed 19 \u2018ghost\u2019 community health centres and dispensaries in Khyber Agency that had been functioning only on papers since 2003-04.

The 26-year-old Italian the biggest name in the French league since Zlatan Ibrahimovic left Paris Saint-Germain at the end of last season managed only four goals in 28 appearances for Liverpool and spent last season on loan at AC Milan, where he found the net once in 20 league appearances. \u201cI've told Mario what I expect him to do,\u201d Nice coach Lucien Favre said Friday. \u201cI told him I don't make any difference between my players, only the best play.

{"1281604": {"date": "Updated September 04, 2016", "article": "The series \u2018Look at the city from here\u2019 on the 10th anniversary of the Gandhara Art-Space concludes with Farida Batool\u2019s solo show \u2018By the high wall and the closed gates\u2019. Following the same pattern as the previous two solos in the series, the show looks at the artist\u2019s oeuvre from 2009 onwards, coupled with new works, to create a dialogue on the city\u2019s distinct character from the artist\u2019s perspective.Batool\u2019s work is political commentary through an \u2018urban\u2019 language and gets deep into the pulsating spirit of the city. She focuses on violence and terror, but goes beyond the cursory glance and dissects the emergence of the culture of fear that has quietly settled in and is subtly choking the city. As the artist says, \u201cI feel like most people look at [Lahore] in black and white instead of showing the nuances of the complexities of the city.\u201dShe achieves this perfectly through her piece \u2018Kahani eik shehr ki\u2019, which incorporates small postcard sized lenticular prints placed in a long straight line, creating an illusion of the artist taking us on a journey of roadsides with Lahore as her backdrop. She passes a mosque and the Lahore High Court with various vendors, policemen and lawyers outside. \nThe citizens, cars, rickshaws, containers and barricades come together to highlight the undertones of fear that exist in the everyday. \nFarida Batool goes beyond the cursory glance and dissects the emergence of the culture of fear that has quietly settled in and is subtly choking Lahore\n\nThe walk ends with a long wall covered with layers of graffiti. Batool\u2019s own words describe this part of the work perfectly, \u201cThe layered images are often related through the notion of memory or history, with\u00a0the\u00a0\u2018earlier\u2019\u00a0image being both partially erased but also constitutive of the\u00a0\u2018later\u2019 image in order to portray contrasting realities.\u201d This piece is able to say a lot about the city on multiple levels, giving us a complete sense of the nature of Lahore, its spirituality, its street life poised at a vulnerable edge, its layers of history contextualising the present. Her choice of lenticular printing is not just meant to create interesting illusions, however, but informs the narrative. \u201cIn a video the audience has to watch the events in a particular sequence, but with lenticular prints they have a choice between what they want to see and what they don\u2019t.\u201d This is most relevant in the piece \u2018Dekhna mana hai\u2019 where you feel the suffocation inflicted by the male gaze, but you have the power to choose to shut your eyes as you move across the piece. This control is an illusion in itself though, as a few eyes shut, others open, and you end up in the same frustrating struggle for control that is reality.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\t\u2018World Cup 2016\u2019\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\nThe gradual progression of fear in Pakistani society can be mapped by the increasingly visible measures taken to ensure \u2018security\u2019\u2014 which itself lend to the tense air of our cities. In a series of photographs, \u2018Oos sheher ka band darwaza\u2019, \u2018Oos sheher main mohabbat\u2019 and \u2018Oos sheher ki oonchi deewar\u2019, we see barbed wire isolated on a white background, and the whole frame covered by a red brick wall. Batool brings these signifiers of our underlying fear out of the background and into stark view. At the same time, the barbed wire gives the illusion of a heart shape with a string of gajras that are sold at traffic signals, which look dark, colourless and morbid but hint at the presence of love amongst the violence. It signals the existence of normal life amidst the chaos, or perhaps the ethereal omnipresence of danger amidst normal life.The most striking piece, however, that perfectly depicts our current human condition is \u2018World Cup 2016\u2019. Here we find the bloodshed and violence in the past year likened to a sport, where human life is a plaything, and news almost seems like a public contest for the inhumane. It is inspired by a video that was released of a couple of young boys kicking around the decapitated head of a policeman. It alludes to the appropriation of violence in our society and the death of our conscience as the consumption of brutal imagery becomes commonplace through social media and television.As a reaction to this Batool has prints of hands, arms and feet cut up and constructed into actual footballs that litter the floor. It looks like a surreal cross between a warzone of limbs, skin and hair strewn across the floor, and a playground of footballs. The fact that the audience is welcome to play with these balls makes it somewhat unnerving.

This love is one-sided. A few days ago I expressed my feelings to her through a message on Facebook, even though she has not yet accepted my request. My frequent messages resulted in a reply from her, saying \u201cDon\u2019t text me again. Please relax and stay happy. I am not interested in a relationship with you.\u201d This broke my heart and crushed my soul, but I cannot forget about her. I am still in love and I have positive hopes for both of us in future. Please provide me with a solid solution to cope with this problem. I can\u2019t control my sorrow any more. I am exhausted. Sometimes I think that I should live no more because the person with whom I am in love with has no feelings for me. But I am still hoping. Thanks a lot.LovelornDear Hurting,If you have expressed your love to this girl and she has clearly told you she is not interested, you have to let it go. \nAnything else you do (especially after a girl has been so direct) can be construed as harassment and that is not something any self-respecting person would want to be known for. To be honest, bombarding her with texts was harassment.You need to work on your relationship with yourself. You need to learn to love and respect yourself and realise that no one \u2014 absolutely no one \u2014 is more important than you. Remind yourself every day; every morning look in the mirror and remind yourself how fantastic you are. Focus on real qualities and strengths: subjects you are good at, sports that you play well, many friends, supportive parents. \u00a0This is not about being selfish. It is about respecting and honouring yourself. You can be disappointed that the girl said no, but you should never love anyone more than you love yourself.\u00a0Instead of saying I cannot control my sorrow say, I am disappointed but I am strong and smart and am going to move on.Could you be happy in an unequal relationship, where one partner is devoted and the other couldn\u2019t care less? What kind of a relationship would that be? Pretty draining for the loving partner for sure. Being in a relationship with someone who just does not reciprocate your feelings is far worse, lonelier and more difficult to get out of. Salam Khala jani,I am a 14-year-old girl in eighth grade in a very good school. My brother has done his O\u2019 levels first year and as nowadays his school is off he does nothing except watching movies on his phone. He does not go to tuition regularly nor does he do any other outdoor activity. The problem is that he is so addicted to his phone that he listens to nobody else in the home, not even to our father. And sometimes he says that he wants to go to tuition alone, without anyone.\u00a0Father gets very irritated with his behaviour as sometimes he talks rudely with him too. Whenever father tries to teach him something good he says that you people always take me wrong. I\u2019m just fed up with his behaviour. TenseDear Sis,Your brother is a teenager so some of his rebellion is to be expected and your parents may have been expecting it. \nHowever he is lucky to have a sister who is so concerned about him and realises that his phone usage is excessive. \nTo some extent your father realises that all is not well with your brother. The issue is that you are still not an adult and cannot enforce rules in the house, so you have to work with and rely on your parents in order to help your brother. You need to speak to your parents regarding setting rules about gadgets. Tell your parents that both of them need to enforce rules regarding phone usage equally and not give in. Talk to your parents and help them recognise the extent of your brother\u2019s problem. Find resources that will inform them about excessive phone usage and its effects. Help them set down new rules and support them in enforcing that. \u00a0Your brother might suspect your motives for doing this, so be sure that you are truly concerned, be supportive of him and don\u2019t become militant about nabbing him. Support your parents, but let them handle this.Dear Auntie, I was reading the poor bahu\u2019s issues in your column last week. Married for almost nine years, I have two boys, ages eight and four and am living happily with my husband and kids. While I was reading that, I could feel the girl\u2019s pain since I have been through the same. Husbands are not best friends in the early years of marriage. The wife has to sacrifice and set an example despite all the wrong-doings of the in-laws. Later she will be in a position where she can proudly \u2018lajawab\u2019 them.\u00a0I also had horrible episodes with my in-laws when my mother-in-law cursed me and my parents from in front of the entire family. It is really difficult to clear each and every minor or major issue in the family. My husband and I were never alone except to sleep and whenever we tried to talk on issues, MIL or SIL were listening to us. And that led to more horrible episodes. I had my first baby nine months after my marriage. I wanted my in-laws to all die in an accident, or whatever. My confidence was shaken badly. I don\u2019t think that if she shares all this with her husband he would understand, as only half an year has passed in their marriage. Anyhow, please ask the girl to be patient. These difficulties are given to those whom Allah loves. A diamond has to go through a painful procedure to make it shine. She has to set an example for her kids. And do not be like your in-laws! \nP.S. My saas is my very good friend now and my sisters-in-law now defend me every time. Difficult times pass.Auntie will not reply privately to any query.

Central banks are the custodians of the confidence that is so essential to the smooth functioning of the financial system, particularly in the area of sovereign debt. This can be a high-wire act in bad times when the data says one thing and the job demands another. The State Bank governor tried to perform this fragile balancing act on Thursday when he held a news conference to try to reassure the markets that the country\u2019s debt-servicing capacity remains strong and whatever drop in remittances we saw in July owed itself mostly to temporary factors. But then he went far beyond the data in suggesting that the future is strong because the energy situation had been sorted, exporters had received assurances of expedited tax refunds, the law and order situation was improving, and more. In short, instead of an economic analysis, he presented a list of positives that sounded more political in tone.In doing so, he has gone beyond his role as a curator of the financial markets. He was absolutely right to reassure the markets that Pakistan has not defaulted on its sovereign debts, even in bad times, and nothing in the data suggests that debt-service difficulties are around the corner. He was also right to point out that in the two years preceding 2013, debt-service obligations were higher than they are now and they were still met \u2018successfully\u2019. But it is worth recalling that at the end of this period, Pakistan landed up on the doorstep of the IMF. So how \u2018successfully\u2019 were these obligations really met if addressing the challenge landed the government in the emergency room? More than the present level of foreign exchange reserves, what determines a country\u2019s debt-service capacity is the state of its external deficits. Is the economy really accumulating non-debt-creating reserves? If so, where is the $7bn windfall that came our way in the past couple of years from the decline in oil prices? Now that the data shows deterioration in the health of the three main pillars of the external account \u2014 FDI, exports and remittances \u2014 it is indeed time for the State Bank to step in and breathe a little confidence into the debt markets. But in doing so, it would be better to leave the rhetoric to the politicians and stick to what the data allows one to say.Published in Dawn, September 3rd, 2016\n", "author": "Editorial", "title": "SBP governor\u2019s take"}}

The veteran leader, 78, whose death was officially announced on Friday several days after he suffered a stroke, played Russia, China and the West off against one other to avoid total isolation as he steered his strategic state out of the collapse of the Soviet Union. \u201cIslam Karimov has been the state for over quarter of a century, ruling with an iron fist,\u201d Steve Swerdlow, Central Asia researcher for Human Rights Watch, said. Mr Karimov\u2019s authoritarian rule came under fire over accusations of rights abuses, most prominently over bloodshed in the city of Andijan in 2005, but the most serious threats to his reign came from far closer to home. In a court drama with echoes of Shakespeare, the former Soviet apparatchik \u2014 at the helm since 1989 \u2014 had his eldest daughter put under house arrest in 2014 during a family feud in which she compared him to brutal Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. The spectacular fall from grace of Gulnara Karimova \u2014 a pop-singing, corruption-tainted socialite once seen as a possible heir to her father\u2019s throne \u2014 appeared to show just how far Mr Karimov was willing to go to keep his iron grip on power. Mr Karimov, long the subject of rumours about his ill health, has now left no obvious successor in a country that has never held an election judged free and fair by international monitors. Born on January 30, 1938, the Uzbek leader was raised in an orphanage in the ancient city of Samarkand. He studied engineering and rose up the Communist Party ladder to become head of Soviet Uzbekistan in 1989. Like the authoritarian leader of neighbouring Kazakhstan, Nursultan Nazarbayev, Mr Karimov led his country through the transition from the former USSR without any major challenge to his rule. Critics, however, say he squandered the potential of his cotton-rich nation of 30 million and allowed corrupt elite to amass huge fortunes. The major challenge for him came when the palace power struggle within his own family emerged in 2013. The house arrest of the once-untouchable Gulnara Karimova, 44, came after a war of words played out in the international media during which she accused her mother and younger sister of sorcery, and assailed the country\u2019s security chief on Twitter for harbouring presidential ambitions.Published in Dawn, September 3rd, 2016\n", "author": "Agencies", "title": "Uzbekistan strongman Karimov dies, to be buried in Samarkand"}}

{"1281714": {"date": "September 03, 2016", "article": "SO it\u2019s September and Europe is back at work. There is much to discuss and to do. Problems abound. Europe faces a host of difficult challenges, many internal, some external \u2014 and next year is set to be even more challenging. Everyone is braced for an autumn and winter of discontent. The world kept turning as the EU took a long summer break. The war in Syria continued to wreak havoc, refugees fled devastation, the earthquake in Italy killed and injured many, there were suicide bombs in Yemen, Turkey and Kabul and strongmen in Russia, Turkey and the US thundered poison and venom.And oh yes, there were the Olympics, bringing some relief and excitement in an increasingly angry, intolerant and difficult world. There was also a landmark peace deal in Colombia between the government and the main left-wing rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), putting an end to one of the world\u2019s longest-running insurgencies.Europe reacted to the events of course \u2014 but internal difficulties took centre stage. Europe\u2019s focus is on itself, its challenges and dilemmas. Certainly, many EU policymakers keep a close watch on global events. But in the end, for many, Europe comes first.Even when it comes to taking a holiday. Its certainly good politics for European leaders to take their vacations in Europe. Trekking in the Alps rather than in the Himalayas shows that a European leader \u2014 like Britain\u2019s new Prime Minister Theresa May \u2014 is careful with money and committed to Europe.But staying close to home has its disadvantages. Staying inside the cosy European cocoon may be cheap, comfortable and familiar. But it leads to complacency. If EU leaders had travelled a bit further, say to Asia for instance, they would know that the EU star is rapidly losing its sparkle.Europe has certainly been in the news over the summer. But the headlines have been less than flattering. Media across the world has focused on three key questions which unfortunately appear to define Europe in 2016: burkinis, borders and Brexit. Gone are the compliments and the glowing words, the soft focus on European cities, museums, and food, abiding admiration for European integration efforts, the noble pledge to steer clear of war and turmoil. No longer, no more.Step outside Europe and its clear: the EU has lost its reputation and clout. It\u2019s political, diplomatic and economic influence is slipping, its standing is in tatters. Forget talk about European values. A watching world knows very clearly that Europe has lost its mojo. And nobody is celebrating.For most of the summer, France grabbed the headlines with its bizarre decision to ban so-called \u2018burkinis\u2019. Images of Muslim women being ordered to undress on French beaches caught the global imagination, triggering animated debates on what had happened to a country known for its commitment to \u201cliberte, egalite and fraternite\u201d.The burkini was of course only the tip of the iceberg. As the country heads for presidential elections in 2017, the French debate on Islam is expected to become even fiercer, with Marine Le Pen, the leader of the xenophobic and anti-Muslim Front National, calling the shots and other politicians including the centre-right presidential candidate Nicolas Sarkozy, frantically struggling to keep up.The game in France over the coming months is going to be a simple one: who can sound tougher on Islam and Muslims. Le Pen is unlikely to become French president. But she will set the political agenda for the country and dominate the political discourse for months to come.Which brings us to refugees and Europe\u2019s ongoing struggle to deal with the large number of migrants and asylum seekers who keep knocking on its doors.The EU once captured the headlines for its bold moves to eliminate borders to create a frontier free single market. The image now is of an EU determined to protect itself with barbed wire fences, armed policemen and more. This is especially the case in many eastern European states where restrictive new laws making life difficult for asylum seekers and refugees, anti-migrant rhetoric by decision makers and high-ranking politicians is commonplace.Asylum seekers and refugees are called \u201cintruders,\u201d and \u201cpotential terrorists\u201d, bent on destroying Western civilisation and Christianity. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban himself in July referred to migration as \u201cpoison\u201d. Gyorgy Schopflin, a ruling party member with a seat in the European Parliament, suggested on Twitter that pigs\u2019 heads should be placed on the border fence with Serbia to deter Muslim refugees from entering Hungary.And then of course there is Brexit. The world can\u2019t really believe that a country would willingly leave a much-coveted rich men\u2019s club. And no one seems as confused as Britain\u2019s Prime Minister Theresa May.Her mantra of \u201cBrexit means Brexit\u201d is beginning to ring hollow, not least because the government has yet to decide on just when to invoke \u201carticle 50\u201d which will kick-start negotiations on Britain\u2019s withdrawal from the EU.Many including former premier Tony Blair seem to believe that Britain could change course either through a second referendum or new elections. But others denounce this as wishful thinking.Who knows? Europeans once stood out for their post-modern values and aspirations, their ability to make friends with former enemies. That\u2019s no longer the case. Europe in the autumn of 2016 appears fragile, fraught and afraid. And it may stay this way for most of next year.\u2014The writer is Dawn\u2019s correspondent in Brussels.Published in Dawn, September 3rd, 2016\n", "author": "Shada Islam", "title": "VIEW FROM ABROAD: Europe\u2019s autumn of discontent: burkinis, borders and Brexit"}}
