They broke Sri Lanka\u2019s record tally of 443 against Netherlands in 2006.     Opener Alex Hales overcame his dismal run in the Test series, scoring a scintillating 171 off 122 deliveries to set up the mammoth score. The ever-reliable Joe Root figured in a 248-run second wicket partnership with Hales. Wicketkeeper Jos Buttler and Eoin Morgan ensured that their side posted a virtually unassailable target, putting up 161 for the fourth wicket.   Pakistan were never really in the hunt in the face of such a formidable score. They made a valiant effort nevertheless, scoring at well above six runs an over during the first 20 overs. Sharjeel Khan led the chase with a sizzling 58. But the loss of wickets at regular intervals put them out of contention as five batsmen were back in the pavilion inside 20 overs.

Let us be realistic \u2014 nothing happened without a green signal from the relevant powers once General (later Field Marshal) Ayub Khan took the additional charge of defence minister in 1954.Decades later, there were many political parties and leaders who strongly opposed the grant of $30m to Samiul Haq\u2019s Madressah Haqqani.

It is a fact that originally it was the Western powers which in their own interests gave billions of dollars to various Pakistani organisations to sponsor, finance, train and arm jihadis and extremists to fight Soviet forces in Afghanistan, which they invaded in 1979. In fact, Muslim fundamentalists, Christian neocons and others joined hands to fight Soviet atheists.

{"1281382": {"date": "September 04, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s official: superstar Hirthik Roshan\u2019s Mohenjo Daro has flopped in the domestic market! With a whopping alleged budget of Rs1 billion out of which Rs160 million was spent on production, it has barely earned Rs550 million from the Indian market in the two weeks that it has been running. Although the TV satellite rights and the international market will help the producers recover most of their investment, a substantial profit still isn\u2019t possible.Directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, Mohenjo Daro was touted as a historical film based on an era which so far hasn\u2019t been depicted in Hindi films. The Indus Valley civilization dates back to around 2500 BCE [more than 4,000 years old]. The archeological site of Mohenjo Daro is situated in Sindh, and was one the largest urbanised settlements of the Indus Valley civilization. It was discovered and excavated in the 1920s.Ashutosh said he carried out three years of research before writing the story. One doubts his statement. The costumes, the giant sets, props and even the language used in Mohenjo Daro represent a different era from what historians have reported after carrying out excavations at the site. Even the terracotta artefacts tell a different tale of the people who once lived there.In an episode of The Kapil Sharma Show, Ashutosh admitted that history was never his favourite subject in school. One wonders then what prompted the director to take on the subject. Previously, he has dabbled in history with Jodhaa Akbar (the Mughal period), Lagaan  (the Colonial era) and Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey (the 1930 Chittagong Uprising against the British Raj).\nMohenjo Daro is yet another gross misinterpretation of history to grace the silver screen\n\nBut Ashutosh isn\u2019t alone in depicting history as he perceives it. Most Indian film directors happily take on historical figures or incidents, labeling them as epics. While one can understand creative licenses, misrepresentation is an altogether different thing. In the 100-year-old Indian film industry there are many such examples. For some reason, film-makers from the days of Alam Ara (1931) are obsessed with historical subjects and happily alter facts to suit their film-making needs. The most-loved screen character is that of Mughal Emperor Akbar (A.D.1542-1605). While many films have been made on him and his son Emperor Jahangir, Mughal-i-Azam is supposed to be an all-time favourite. There was Taj Mahal followed by Anarkali; Taj Mahal: the epic love story; and of course Jodhaa Akbar. They are eye-candy with gigantic and opulent sets, majestic costumes (copied by fashion designers for wedding outfits) and good-looking female actors such as Madhubala, Bina Rai, Sonya Jehan (granddaughter of Madam Noor Jehan), and of course Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan. A melodious soundtrack further added to the glamour of these productions. Had it not been for the titles and set design, any of these films could have easily been mistaken for a neurotic love story of a typical Bollywood masala film.The other great emperor to be misrepresented on celluloid is Samrat Ashoka (268 to 232 BCE). Amrapali (starring Sunil Dutt, Vyjanthimala) and Asoka (Shah Rukh Khan, Kareen Kapoor) based on the emperor\u2019s life, conquests and later his adoption of Buddhism have taken such creative liberty with the subject matter that historians have every right to cry foul.In Bajirao Mastani by director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the Kokanastha Brahmin community from Maharashtra to which Bajirao (A.D.1700-40) belonged, opposed the misrepresentation to such an extent that Bhansali had to carry a long disclaimer at the beginning of the film. Even the Rajputs of Rajasthan had objected to the presentation of Jodhaa in Jodhaa Akbar, which again led to the film having a disclaimer. Next in line was Ketan Mehta\u2019s Mangal Pandey \u2013 The Rising starring Aamir Khan. It was factually opposed by the descendents of freedom fighter Mangal Pandey (1827-57).In this context, both director Ashutosh Gowariker and Mohenjo Daro are lucky as no known descendants of the Indus Valley civilisation are around today to object to the gross misinterpretation of facts which run from form of governance to the reasons for Mohenjo Daro\u2019s eventual demise and even the city\u2019s name itself \u2013 Mohejo Daro (The Mound of the Dead) is a modern concoction, not the city\u2019s name when it actually existed! A slightly better presentation would have taken the film a long way, as this is the first production to be based on that time period.It\u2019s not as though all historical films made in Bollywood misrepresent history. There are some excellent ones too. We won\u2019t include Gandhi in the list as it was made by British director Richard Attenborough.But there are others. Shatranj ke Khilari (1977) by Satyjit Ray dealt with the decadence of royalty of Central North India, which was exploited by the British to annex the Kingdom of Awadh in 1856. The film represented that era aptly but didn\u2019t do too well. As it dealt with nawabs, Shatranj ke Khilari depicted regal ambience and majestic outfits. Opposed to this was Pather Panchali by the same director. It depicted poverty in the villages soon after the famous Bengal famine of 1943. Pather Panchali is a harsh but true and no-frills-attached film that won several national and international awards for its sheer artistic beauty, while depicting crippling poverty at that point in time\u200b.Director Deepa Mehta\u2019s Earth (1988) gave valuable insight into Partition and the havoc it created with interpersonal relationships. Mehta\u2019s second film, Water, was set in 1938 and dealt with the treatment meted out to widows in Varanasi. These were good films with sound research which made fictional figures appear quite realistic. There have been others as well such as Black Friday, Hey Ram, Parzania, Train to Pakistan, Firaaq, Bombay etc. Earlier, we also had Garam Hawa, Junoon, Sardar, Pinjar and others where the directors took an incident in history and stuck to as true a depiction as possible.If film-makers can\u2019t stay true to history, then they should at least use a different title for\u200b such films and not advertise them as \u2018historical\u2019. As in the case of Mohenjo Daro, even the mighty Hrithik Roshan could not get it the footfalls required to guarantee success.Published in Dawn, Sunday Magazine, September 4th, 2016\n", "author": "Surekha Kadapa-Bose", "title": "ForeignFront: Distorting history for the sake of masala in Hindi films"}}

More than 13,000 people were rescued in under a week at the end of May, and 8,300 more at the start of August.The Italian coastguard predicted that weather conditions would encourage the departure of further migrant boats on Tuesday.The vessels are often flimsy and overcrowded while some of the migrants set off in such poor health that even if the crossing is calm they cannot survive a day at sea.There are around a dozen vessels run by humanitarian groups that patrol the waters off the Libyan coast, but tensions in the zone have flared recently as rival factions battle to control migrant trafficking.This month an MSF ship taking part in migrant rescue operations came under attack from armed men who shot at the vessel before briefly climbing aboard, the medical charity said.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Over 6,500 migrants rescued off Libya"}}

{"1281112": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "KARACHI: Like any other event involving the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) these days, there was a lot of speculation about what might transpire at the oath-taking ceremony for the jailed mayor-elect of Karachi, Waseem Akhtar, and his deputy, Arshad Abdullah Vohra, on Tuesday. Some journalists suggested that Rangers might show up at the ceremony, but the idea was rejected soon after the event got under way. Others were betting on whether or not Mr Akhtar would raise the \u201cLong Live Pakistan\u201d slogan after taking the oath. The speculation stemmed from the fact that the MQM leader was to be produced before a district and sessions court at 11am, right when the oath-taking ceremony was to commence. Within a few minutes, reports came in that the district and sessions judge (South), Imdad Khoso, had withdrawn an earlier order on the basis of \u201cnot having clearance from the Sindh High Court to administer the oath-taking ceremony\u201d. As a result, the returning officer for the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), Samiuddin Siddiqui, requested the authorities to present Mr Akhtar at the event to take the oath. As soon as the order was passed, the empty seats began to fill up as one after the other diplomats, ambassadors and businessmen started to show up at the venue. The fact that Karachi would finally have a mayor after a gap of seven years was repeated far too often at the event. The deputy convener of the MQM\u2019s coordination committee, Dr Farooq Sattar, was the first from the party\u2019s senior cadre to walk in, followed by Khwaja Izhar-ul-Hassan. While Dr Sattar seemed to be avoiding the media after frequently appearing on television channels in the wake of the Aug 22 speech by Altaf Hussain, Khwaja Izhar seemed to be ready to give a speech to the press that asked him for a sound bite. However, his speech about \u201cpolitical participation and peace\u201d was interrupted midway when Mr Akhtar and Mr Vohra walked in. Amid a rather unenthusiastic applause from the audience, the mayor-elect took to the stage while waving to the people, first towards actor Behroz Sabzwari and then Dr Sattar who was sitting with some diplomats. Conspicuous by his absence from the audience was Governor Ishratul Ibad Khan, amid reports that the MQM is again trying to have him replaced. The brief silence that followed was broken by the host, who called Samiuddin Siddiqui to formally begin the proceedings which were already late by more than 90 minutes. Both Mr Akhtar and Mr Vohra then took their oaths, by repeating the words uttered by Mr Siddiqui and occasionally correcting him. The former administrator of Karachi, Laiq Ahmed, was then requested to hand over the \u201ckeys\u201d of the city to the elected mayor. Just as this was happening, MQM supporters raised the party slogan, chanting \u201cZinda Hai Mohajir Zinda Hai (Mohajirs are alive)\u201d and Jiye Muttahida (Long Live Muttahida)\u201d. Just then, a few people at the back raised the Bhutto slogan and within minutes a shouting match between pro-Muttahida and pro-PPP workers began. Mr Akhtar raised the slogans of the two parties, adding \u201cJiye Imran Khan\u201d, to make everyone happy. He then asked whether he could continue with his speech. Though that did not happen, as the group of PPP workers continued chanting their slogans, Mr Akhtar continued by thanking all the contesting political parties. He followed this up by thanking the Sindh government and Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, adding that Karachi needed an energetic and dynamic leader like Mr Shah to resolve the pending issues of \u201cthe city which was never treated right\u201d. Thanking the Supreme Court, he said it had taken nine long months before he finally could take the oath of his office. In a special mention of the PPP chairperson and co-chairperson, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari, Mr Akhtar added that they would all have to work together. Switching to English to address the business leaders of the city, he said that \u201cfalse but bailable charges\u201d had been filed against him, for which he had submitted a bail application in the court. What was absent from his speech was any mention of MQM founder Altaf Hussain. Once the ceremony was over, a relaxed Dr Sattar said the past nine months had been \u201ca painstaking and nerve-wrecking process\u201d for the party. He said: \u201cI\u2019m glad that we have a mayor now. But we need to have participatory politics rather than an isolated one. I\u2019m glad that [Mr] Akhtar mentioned all the political parties in his speech as we\u2019d like the participation of all political parties to make changes in Karachi.\u201d He said the mayor would first need to \u201cseek a parole, from where we\u2019ll take things forward\u201d. In the end, Mr Akhtar joined Dr Sattar on stage to answer queries from media personnel. Without mentioning the party chief, the mayor said that they would \u201cprotect Pakistan\u201d.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Saher Baloch", "title": "Akhtar takes mayor\u2019s oath, doesn\u2019t mention Altaf"}}

Yet it is premature to write off Altaf Hussain whose name has been synonymous with the very existence of the MQM. From his base in London, he still maintains contact with his supporters in Pakistan and across the world.  Altaf Hussain may have been wounded but he has certainly survived any detonating of the \u2018suicide vest\u2019 as others describe it. It appears obvious that what happened on Aug 22 was part of an organised plan that boomeranged. The party leadership in Pakistan may have dissociated itself from him and removed his name from the party constitution as the supreme leader whose decision could not be challenged. But it is extremely difficult to destroy the cult that has been built around his personality for the past three decadesOne fully empathises with Farooq Sattar who is walking a tightrope. Unsurprisingly, he dare not make a complete rupture and denounce his former leader publicly for his act of treason, for fear of breaking unity among the Muttahida leadership in Pakistan. There is also a fear of backlash from the militant wing that is directly controlled from London and that still pledges loyalty to the supreme leader, though it has been crippled by the ongoing operation. Examine: Confronting MQM\u2019s pastInterestingly, Altaf Hussain too has kept silent over the internal party revolt that claims to have stripped him of his undisputed authority reinforcing suspicion about a mutually agreed separation short of a divorce. It is, indeed, surprising that the entire Pakistani leadership overnight turned against their supreme leader whom they had defended even against the charges of an Indian connection. So what is the deal?   \nAltaf Hussain may have been wounded but he has certainly survived any detonating of the \u2018suicide vest\u2019.\n\nMany believe that while the party organisation in Pakistan would be allowed to operate independently, the London office would continue to control the overseas branches. They would maintain an aggressive stance to internationalise the issue of the alleged extra-judicial killing of MQM workers and their enforced disappearances. Altaf Hussain\u2019s latest harangue through telephonic addresses to MQM workers in America and South Africa lends credence to these theories.  This arrangement was, perhaps, necessary to ensure the success of the party\u2019s candidate for city mayor in the elections held a few days later. Waseem Akhtar, who was nominated with the approval of Altaf Hussain months ago, swept the polls easily with not a single MQM vote wasted. Any reaction from London against the decision of the Pakistan-based committee would have divided the party which could have caused it to lose control of the city government. By separating the Karachi and London committees, the MQM has apparently escaped the possibility of being banned. Almost all the major political parties are opposed to any move that could lead to the disintegration of the party into splinters thus strengthening militancy. For sure, the ongoing Rangers operation in Karachi has crippled the party\u2019s militant wing and contained its capacity to bring the city to a halt as it did frequently in the past. But the party is still deeply entrenched in the city and its vote bank has remained intact as demonstrated in the local government polls and various by-elections. The creation of the Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) led by Mustafa Kamal may have made some dents in the MQM but it has failed to make much of an impact on the city\u2019s politics largely because of the perception of it being sponsored by the security establishment as part of a plan to re-engineer Karachi\u2019s politics. The latest crisis in the MQM may result in PSP support for some more defectors, but there is little possibility of it making any inroads into the hard-core Urdu-speaking vote bank. Such political manipulations by the security agencies have failed in the past too. In fact, the Rangers\u2019 revenge action following Aug 22 has played into Altaf Hussain\u2019s politics of victimhood so cleverly exploited by him in the past.

Mr Dar said the OECD model is much better than a simple bilateral \narrangement seeking information about tax matters.The cabinet also approved the initialled draft of the revised convention between Pakistan and the Swiss Confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on Income.Elaborating, the minister said this process was initiated in 2014 and a two-member Pakistani delegation had held successful negotiatio{"1281152": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "NEW YORK: Eugenie Bouchard wrung her hands at her post-match news conference.

Some journalists suggested that Rangers might show up at the ceremony, but the idea was rejected soon after the event got under way. Others were betting on whether or not Mr Akhtar would raise the \u201cLong Live Pakistan\u201d slogan after taking the oath. The speculation stemmed from the fact that the MQM leader was to be produced before a district and sessions court at 11am, right when the oath-taking ceremony was to commence. Within a few minutes, reports came in that the district and sessions judge (South), Imdad Khoso, had withdrawn an earlier order on the basis of \u201cnot having clearance from the Sindh High Court to administer the oath-taking ceremony\u201d. As a result, the returning officer for the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), Samiuddin Siddiqui, requested the authorities to present Mr Akhtar at the event to take the oath. As soon as the order was passed, the empty seats began to fill up as one after the other diplomats, ambassadors and businessmen started to show up at the venue. The fact that Karachi would finally have a mayor after a gap of seven years was repeated far too often at the event. The deputy convener of the MQM\u2019s coordination committee, Dr Farooq Sattar, was the first from the party\u2019s senior cadre to walk in, followed by Khwaja Izhar-ul-Hassan. While Dr Sattar seemed to be avoiding the media after frequently appearing on television channels in the wake of the Aug 22 speech by Altaf Hussain, Khwaja Izhar seemed to be ready to give a speech to the press that asked him for a sound bite. However, his speech about \u201cpolitical participation and peace\u201d was interrupted midway when Mr Akhtar and Mr Vohra walked in. Amid a rather unenthusiastic applause from the audience, the mayor-elect took to the stage while waving to the people, first towards actor Behroz Sabzwari and then Dr Sattar who was sitting with some diplomats. Conspicuous by his absence from the audience was Governor Ishratul Ibad Khan, amid reports that the MQM is again trying to have him replaced. The brief silence that followed was broken by the host, who called Samiuddin Siddiqui to formally begin the proceedings which were already late by more than 90 minutes. Both Mr Akhtar and Mr Vohra then took their oaths, by repeating the words uttered by Mr Siddiqui and occasionally correcting him. The former administrator of Karachi, Laiq Ahmed, was then requested to hand over the \u201ckeys\u201d of the city to the elected mayor. Just as this was happening, MQM supporters raised the party slogan, chanting \u201cZinda Hai Mohajir Zinda Hai (Mohajirs are alive)\u201d and Jiye Muttahida (Long Live Muttahida)\u201d. Just then, a few people at the back raised the Bhutto slogan and within minutes a shouting match between pro-Muttahida and pro-PPP workers began. Mr Akhtar raised the slogans of the two parties, adding \u201cJiye Imran Khan\u201d, to make everyone happy. He then asked whether he could continue with his speech. Though that did not happen, as the group of PPP workers continued chanting their slogans, Mr Akhtar continued by thanking all the contesting political parties. He followed this up by thanking the Sindh government and Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, adding that Karachi needed an energetic and dynamic leader like Mr Shah to resolve the pending issues of \u201cthe city which was never treated right\u201d. Thanking the Supreme Court, he said it had taken nine long months before he finally could take the oath of his office. In a special mention of the PPP chairperson and co-chairperson, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari, Mr Akhtar added that they would all have to work together.

He informed the audience that in future the local government agencies would be put to prosecution as a matter of policy without giving them any exemption as like cases against other public, private, and industrial institutions in the province were referred to environmental tribunals for their unsafe practices causing damage to environment. Sindh Transport Minister Nasir Hussain Shah said the present Sindh government of the Pakistan Peoples Party was fully committed to resolving transportation problems of the people of Karachi for which Bus Rapid Transit System (BRTS) was being constructed. He said in a coming few days, he would fly to China for signing a memorandum of understanding for launching the Yellow Line \u2014 a component of BRTS. He claimed that the Sindh government on its part had completed all the prerequisites and formalities regarding the revival of the Karachi Circular Railway (KCR) and now it was up to the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) to make progress for building the circular railway service in Karachi. He said PPP chairman Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari had directed the provincial authorities to give another chance to JICA to make progress towards revival of the KCR, otherwise the Sindh government should go for a renowned Chinese firm to build the project. He said the Sindh government was fully committed to the cause of environment mitigation as for this reason the scope of provincial environment department had been expanded to include subject of climate change and also that the chief minister was holding the additional portfolio of environment department. He said that owing to unchecked practices of municipal agencies, 450 million gallons of untreated waste water was being released into the Arabian Sea while air pollution had been rapidly increasing owing to absence of any solid and municipal waste management system while district municipal corporations were engaged in burning of domestic waste instead of its safe disposal. Ijaz Ahmed Khilji, an expert of mass transport systems, said 42 per cent population of Karachi was dependent on public transport system while passenger buses and other public carriers accounted for just 4.5pc of total number of vehicles, thus, creating serious stress on existing passenger vehicles plying on roads of Karachi.

The CBA had set the deadline of Sept 1for reinstatement of around 1,800 sacked employees, disbursement of pending salaries of many employees and acceptance of certain other demands. Speaking at a meeting of the CBA here on Wednesday, its general secretary Abdul Qayyum Bhatti observed that since the provincial and HDA authorities had failed to respond to the union as yet, workers led by its office-bearers would start an agitation from the Latifabad Unit-9 pumping station on Thursday and keep it shut for two hours (11am to 1pm). \u201cIf our demanded remained unmet for yet another day, we will go ahead with our plan to go on a full strike by closing down the entire system of the Water and Sanitation Agency (Wasa),\u201d he said.

On July 1, he said, over 1,300 contractual and work-charge workers of Wasa and another 500 regular employees of HDA\u2019s various units had been sacked. He said that more than 1,200 regular Wasa workers had not been paid their salaries since June. Besides, the sacked employees were not being paid their dues, he added.Mr Bhatti said that the union had presented its charter of demands to Commissioner Qazi Shahid Pervez, who was also the HDA director general, and Wasa managing director Masood Jumani. The other demands pertained to appointment/regularisation of workers, implementation of son quota of deceased workers, pending pension cases, general provident fund, gratuity and allowances.On Wednesday morning, a large number of HDA workers held a protest demonstration at the Latifabad pumping station in favour of their demands. Led by Mr Bhatti and the CBA\u2019s senior vice president, Imtiaz Kolachi, the protesters raised slogans against the top HDA and Wasa authorities and appealed to the Sindh chief minister to pay attention to their grievances and help address them.Most sacked workers to be reinstated: MDWasa managing director has, meanwhile, hinted at reinstatement of 60 per cent of sacked employees, admitting that they were efficient workers.

He travels on trains that move through one world to another \u2014 yes, through space \u2014 and these inter-galaxies trains have a mind of their own! The story takes place in such a future world that Earth is now just \u2018old earth\u2019.

Considering it another chance at doing what he loves best, riding the rails and exploring the Great Network, Zen agrees. And then the story gets more complicated.There are many characters in the book that are interesting in different, yet unique, ways. And there are many weird and new words that the writer introduces, with definitions and descriptions given too, and it is supposed to add to the uniqueness of the story but it also makes it a bit complicated. But then readers today are used to many writers for youngsters making the narrative different and interesting by using peculiar and hard-to-pronounce words since J.K.

Italy's Serie A, the next biggest spender, parted with \u00a3595 million (700 million euros), according to industry website transfermarkt.com.One beneficiary of the Premier League's first billion-pound spend was shaggy-haired Luiz, 29, who is back just two years after he became the world's most expensive defender with a 50 million move to PSG.Luiz was tipped to lose his place to compatriot Marquinhos at PSG, and has returned to Stamford Bridge for a reported fee of around 34 million.Eastlands exodus\n\u201cI'm delighted to return to Chelsea,\u201d Luiz told the Chelsea website after signing a three-year contract on the last day of the two-month window.\u201cWe had a fantastic story during my first time at the club and I want to help the team and (manager) Antonio Conte achieve a lot of success.\u201d Chelsea also landed Spanish left-back Marcos Alonso from Fiorentina for a reported 23 million, while their Colombian winger Juan Cuadrado left for Juventus on a three-year loan.Sissoko, 27, looked poised to join Everton for much of the day, only for Tottenham to reportedly pip the Merseyside club with a late bid.He signed a five-year contract and is thought to have cost Spurs around 30 million.Tottenham also signed France under-21 winger Georges-Kevin Nkoudou from Marseille for 11 million, with Cameroon forward Clinton Njie going the other way on a season's loan.Everton consoled themselves with a loan deal for West Ham United's Ecuadorean forward Enner Valencia.At Manchester City, five players who have fallen out of favour under new manager Pep Guardiola left Eastlands on season-long loans.England goalkeeper Joe Hart completed his move to Italian side Torino and French midfielder Samir Nasri joined Europa League champions Sevilla.Wilfried Bony pitched up at Stoke City, French centre-back Eliaquim Mangala signed for Valencia and defender Jason Denayer joined Sunderland.Nice move for Mario\nEnglish champions Leicester City broke their transfer record with the 29.7 million capture of Sporting Lisbon's Algerian striker Islam Slimani, who agreed a five-year contract.Sunderland also broke their club record by signing 22-year-old Gabon midfielder Didier Ndong from French side Lorient for a confirmed fee of 16 million.Burnley were another club to make the biggest purchase in their history, buying Irish midfielder Jeff Hendrick from Derby County for a reported 10 million.Mario Balotelli's miserable spell at Liverpool is finally over after he joined French club Nice on a free transfer.The wayward Italy forward scored just four goals in 28 appearances for Liverpool and spent last season on loan at AC Milan.Arsenal's injury-prone England international midfielder Jack Wilshere, 24, was loaned to Bournemouth after slipping down the pecking order at the Emirates Stadium.While there was a flurry of activity among English clubs, Europe's other major leagues saw a relatively quiet deadline day.In addition to Manchester City's Mangala, Spanish side Valencia signed Argentina international centre-back Ezequiel Garay from Zenit St Petersburg for a reported 20 million euros.Espanyol, who are now under Chinese ownership, signed goalkeeper Diego Lopez on loan from AC Milan and secured a loan deal for Mexico defender Diego Reyes from Porto.In Germany, Werder Bremen signed German winger Serge Gnabry from Arsenal, and Hamburg landed Brazilian defender Douglas from Atletico Mineiro for 10 million euros. \n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Luiz makes Chelsea return, Spurs secure Sissoko deal on transfer deadline day"}}

Zarb-i-Azb commenced on June 15, 2014, after an attack on Karachi's Jinnah International Airport. The operation which has gone on for over two years is now in its final phase. \"In 2014, the security environment when Operation Zarb-i-Azb started was such that the country faced various instances of terrorism,\" the DG ISPR said. \"There were 311 IED blasts, 74 attacks, and 26 suicide blasts in 2014.\"\"The salient operational guidelines for Zarb-i-Azb were that it would be an indiscriminate operation, it would avoid collateral damage and it would be mindful of human rights,\" he said. \nSummary of progress made during Operation Zarb-i-Azb\nWar against terror has cost Pakistan $107bn\nNorth Waziristan, Shawal, Khyber Agency cleared by Army\n900 terrorists killed during Khyber I and Khyber II \n66pc locals have returned to tribal areas\nDaesh designs in Pakistan 'foiled', 309 arrested\nOver 21,000 IBOs carried out across Pakistan, nearly 1,400 people arrested\n536 soldiers killed, 2,272 injured during IBOs\n3,500 terrorists killed in IBOs\nAfghan govt, Nato forces did not take adequate action against terrorists\nPoor deployment of armed forces along Afghan side of the border\nGates to be built at all crossing points along Pak-Afghan border\n\n\n'Afghan authorities did not take action against terrorists'\nThe DG ISPR displayed a map showing what he said was the concentration of terrorists in North Waziristan.\n\n\n\t\t\t\t\tMap presented by DG ISPR Asim Bajwa showing concentration of terrorists in North Waziristan.\n\t\t\t\t\n\n\n\"No one could think of going to North Waziristan. It was the epicentre [of terrorism]. It was home to the largest communications infrastructure,\" he said. The origin of most instances of terrorism was North Waziristan, he said. \"After the operation, when we cleared the valley, reaching Dattakhel and were moving towards the border, some terrorists came out from there via Afghanistan and reached the fringes of Khyber Agency.\" \"Before we started the operation, Pakistan had informed all stakeholders \u2500 political, diplomatic and military \u2500 of the operation. The Afghan president, political govt, military leadership, Resolute Support Mission in Afghanistan were all informed of the operation and requested that if terrorists cross the border, they would have to catch them. \"They are your people, you will have to take action against them. But that didn't happen,\" Bajwa said. 'Killed 900 terrorists during Khyber ops'\n\"When the terrorists went towards Khyber Agency, we relocated some forces from the North Waziristan operation [to Khyber] and conducted operations Khyber I and Khyber II.\" \"We recovered weapons, ammunition, IEDs, explosives, communications equipment, hate literature and discovered tunnels,\" he said. \"There was enough explosive material there to carry out five IED blasts every day for 21 years. They could have caused 134,000 casualties with the amount of material we recovered.\"\"North Waziristan has very challenging terrain but despite that, our armed forces went there and cleared all their hideouts, caves and tunnels. But Khyber was even more challenging. It has snowy mountains and was home to hideouts from the Afghan war and had a very high density of IEDs.\" The Army killed 900 terrorists during the Khyber operation, Bajwa said, and dismantled the network of terrorists that was threatening areas in the immediate surroundings, such as Peshawar. 'Shawal is like Switzerland now'\n\"We started operations in Shawal, where all the terrorists from North Waziristan went. It was their last stronghold and they had nowhere to go after that. The operation went well and we cleared every village, every house, every school and every mosque in Shawal.\" \"Shawal is like Switzerland now,\" Bajwa claimed. \"The residents are slowly returning, but they want the Army to stay on and provide stability and revive the economy. Pine nuts are grown in great quantities there. Terrorists were selling them to fund themselves, but now the locals will benefit.\" 'Daesh in Pakistan planned attacks on Islamabad's diplomatic enclave'\nThe DG ISPR said that Daesh \u2500 another name for the militant Islamic State group \u2500 would not be allowed to have a presence in Pakistan. \"We created a comprehensive intelligence picture and saw that Daesh was trying to come into Pakistan. They organised themselves into two groups, the Kutaiba Haris (planning wing) and Kutaiba Mubashir (militant wing) and were trying to get local criminal and terrorist groups to join them,\" Bajwa said. \"Terrorists were frustrated at the time with all the Intelligence-based Operations (IBOs) going on and tried to change hats. The core group had 20-25 people,\" he said. These people were responsible for the attacks on the Faisalabad Dunya office, Lahore Din News office, Express News Sargodha office, and ARY News Islamabad office, he said.  About 309 people who were part of the organisation were arrested, including Afghans and people of Middle Eastern origin. About 157 small freelance groups were also arrested, he said. Even people who did wall-chalking and graffiti for Daesh in Pakistan for Rs1,000 were also arrested, Bajwa said. The group had planned to attacks in the capital's diplomatic enclave, particularly on the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and on foreign embassies, consulates and their employees, Bajwa said. They had also planned to target Islamabad airport and prominent public figures. Border management: armed deployment low on Afghan side of border\nThere are 18 major crossing points between Pakistan and Afghanistan along the 2,600-kilometre-long shared border, Bajwa said. \"We wanted to seal those areas so that terrorists from this side of the border don't go there and vice versa,\" he said.\"\"Lots of terrorists who crossed into neighbouring districts in eastern Afghanistan have built concentration camps.\"\"After clearing Fata... We began emphasising border management and the Torkham Gate was part of that. There will be proper gates made at all crossing points in addition to immigration staff posts,\" the DG ISPR said. He also said hundreds of small posts will be set up where FC forces will be deployed. \"Additional FC wings will be raised, but until that happens, Army troops will provide reinforcement in many areas.\" \"Other related agencies, including Nadra, will have staff posts and crossing will only be possible using valid documents on both sides of the border,\" he said. \"We have posts along the border and have our own forces reinforcing the Frontier Corps, but the same kind of deployment doesn't exist on the Afghan side of the border. Because of that void, there is a lot of presence and movement of terrorists there.\" \"There will be a lot of patrolling to ensure no one can cross the border illegally. It will take time, but we are moving ahead steadily,\" he said.'Over 21,000 IBOs carried out across Pakistan'\nIntelligence-based operations (IBOs), special IBOs and combing operations have been carried out across the country, Bajwa said. The IBOs targeted terrorists, their facilitators, sleeper cells, financiers and abettors.  Around 2,578 were carried out in Balochistan, 9,308 in Punjab, 5,878 in Sindh and 3,263 in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Special IBOs commenced the night the suicide blast at Lahore's Gulshan-i-Iqbal park earlier this year, Bajwa said. So far, 477 special IBOs have been carried out, with 1,399 people apprehended. \"We have increased the scope with the leads we received... We will continue going wherever we need to without any hesitation,\" he said. 'War against terrorism has cost us $107bn'\nThe entire nation has borne the cost of the war against terrorism, which tallied up to $106.9 billion, Bajwa said. During Operation Zarb-i-Azb, 536 soldiers were killed and 2,272 were injured, Bajwa said, whereas 3,500 terrorists were killed. About 66 per cent of locals have returned to areas badly affected by terrorism. \"But it is not enough that we take them  back [to their homes]. We have to help them prosper by means of reconstruction efforts, ensure that the areas are better off [than before], create opportunities for livelihood and revive the local economy so that this kind of terrorism doesn't recur.\" Infrastructural development projects in the region include a 705km road inside North and South Waziristan, a 75km road from Peshawar to Torkham, solar-powered water schemes and the Mirali Tehsil headquarters hospital, the DG ISPR said.  In addition to the above, market complexes, mosques, schools and colleges have also been built in these areas, Bajwa said.'Anti-Pakistan slogans will not be tolerated'\nResponding to a question about Muttahida Qaumi Movement chief Altaf Hussain's anti-Pakistan statements, Bajwa termed Hussain a foreigner residing 5,000km away from Pakistan. \"It is unacceptable for every Pakistani if Altaf Hussain raises anti-Pakistan slogans. The government is already taking action on this issue. \"There has been lots of action on the ground against his incitement to violence. People have been caught and action taken... Everything is before you,\" Bajwa said. \n", "author": "Dawn.com", "title": "'War against terror cost Pakistan $107bn': DG ISPR Asim Bajwa briefs on progress under Operation Zarb-i-Azb"}}

The prime minister in his letter also termed Indian Prime Minister Modi\u2019s remarks on Balochistan as \u201cunwarranted and in complete contravention of the UN charter\u201d.\u201cPakistan will continue its efforts to raise the Kashmir dispute at the international level.

The spokesperson added that with the US, Pakistan has a comprehensive mechanism and all matters of mutual concerns are discussed at bilateral meetings. The US State Department earlier said the Haqqani network and other terrorist groups that operate inside Pakistan and along the Afghan border are a continued security threat to the entire South Asian region and beyond. Secretary Kerry said in New Delhi earlier this week that in recent months Pakistan had taken strong action against the Haqqani network. But last month, Secretary Carter refused to certify that Pakistan had done enough to counter the terrorist network.

{"1281382": {"date": "September 04, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s official: superstar Hirthik Roshan\u2019s Mohenjo Daro has flopped in the domestic market! With a whopping alleged budget of Rs1 billion out of which Rs160 million was spent on production, it has barely earned Rs550 million from the Indian market in the two weeks that it has been running. Although the TV satellite rights and the international market will help the producers recover most of their investment, a substantial profit still isn\u2019t possible.Directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, Mohenjo Daro was touted as a historical film based on an era which so far hasn\u2019t been depicted in Hindi films. The Indus Valley civilization dates back to around 2500 BCE [more than 4,000 years old]. The archeological site of Mohenjo Daro is situated in Sindh, and was one the largest urbanised settlements of the Indus Valley civilization. It was discovered and excavated in the 1920s.Ashutosh said he carried out three years of research before writing the story. One doubts his statement. The costumes, the giant sets, props and even the language used in Mohenjo Daro represent a different era from what historians have reported after carrying out excavations at the site. Even the terracotta artefacts tell a different tale of the people who once lived there.In an episode of The Kapil Sharma Show, Ashutosh admitted that history was never his favourite subject in school. One wonders then what prompted the director to take on the subject. Previously, he has dabbled in history with Jodhaa Akbar (the Mughal period), Lagaan  (the Colonial era) and Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey (the 1930 Chittagong Uprising against the British Raj).\nMohenjo Daro is yet another gross misinterpretation of history to grace the silver screen\n\nBut Ashutosh isn\u2019t alone in depicting history as he perceives it. Most Indian film directors happily take on historical figures or incidents, labeling them as epics. While one can understand creative licenses, misrepresentation is an altogether different thing. In the 100-year-old Indian film industry there are many such examples. For some reason, film-makers from the days of Alam Ara (1931) are obsessed with historical subjects and happily alter facts to suit their film-making needs. The most-loved screen character is that of Mughal Emperor Akbar (A.D.1542-1605). While many films have been made on him and his son Emperor Jahangir, Mughal-i-Azam is supposed to be an all-time favourite. There was Taj Mahal followed by Anarkali; Taj Mahal: the epic love story; and of course Jodhaa Akbar. They are eye-candy with gigantic and opulent sets, majestic costumes (copied by fashion designers for wedding outfits) and good-looking female actors such as Madhubala, Bina Rai, Sonya Jehan (granddaughter of Madam Noor Jehan), and of course Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan. A melodious soundtrack further added to the glamour of these productions. Had it not been for the titles and set design, any of these films could have easily been mistaken for a neurotic love story of a typical Bollywood masala film.The other great emperor to be misrepresented on celluloid is Samrat Ashoka (268 to 232 BCE). Amrapali (starring Sunil Dutt, Vyjanthimala) and Asoka (Shah Rukh Khan, Kareen Kapoor) based on the emperor\u2019s life, conquests and later his adoption of Buddhism have taken such creative liberty with the subject matter that historians have every right to cry foul.In Bajirao Mastani by director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the Kokanastha Brahmin community from Maharashtra to which Bajirao (A.D.1700-40) belonged, opposed the misrepresentation to such an extent that Bhansali had to carry a long disclaimer at the beginning of the film. Even the Rajputs of Rajasthan had objected to the presentation of Jodhaa in Jodhaa Akbar, which again led to the film having a disclaimer. Next in line was Ketan Mehta\u2019s Mangal Pandey \u2013 The Rising starring Aamir Khan. It was factually opposed by the descendents of freedom fighter Mangal Pandey (1827-57).In this context, both director Ashutosh Gowariker and Mohenjo Daro are lucky as no known descendants of the Indus Valley civilisation are around today to object to the gross misinterpretation of facts which run from form of governance to the reasons for Mohenjo Daro\u2019s eventual demise and even the city\u2019s name itself \u2013 Mohejo Daro (The Mound of the Dead) is a modern concoction, not the city\u2019s name when it actually existed! A slightly better presentation would have taken the film a long way, as this is the first production to be based on that time period.It\u2019s not as though all historical films made in Bollywood misrepresent history. There are some excellent ones too. We won\u2019t include Gandhi in the list as it was made by British director Richard Attenborough.But there are others. Shatranj ke Khilari (1977) by Satyjit Ray dealt with the decadence of royalty of Central North India, which was exploited by the British to annex the Kingdom of Awadh in 1856. The film represented that era aptly but didn\u2019t do too well. As it dealt with nawabs, Shatranj ke Khilari depicted regal ambience and majestic outfits. Opposed to this was Pather Panchali by the same director. It depicted poverty in the villages soon after the famous Bengal famine of 1943. Pather Panchali is a harsh but true and no-frills-attached film that won several national and international awards for its sheer artistic beauty, while depicting crippling poverty at that point in time\u200b.Director Deepa Mehta\u2019s Earth (1988) gave valuable insight into Partition and the havoc it created with interpersonal relationships. Mehta\u2019s second film, Water, was set in 1938 and dealt with the treatment meted out to widows in Varanasi. These were good films with sound research which made fictional figures appear quite realistic. There have been others as well such as Black Friday, Hey Ram, Parzania, Train to Pakistan, Firaaq, Bombay etc. Earlier, we also had Garam Hawa, Junoon, Sardar, Pinjar and others where the directors took an incident in history and stuck to as true a depiction as possible.If film-makers can\u2019t stay true to history, then they should at least use a different title for\u200b such films and not advertise them as \u2018historical\u2019. As in the case of Mohenjo Daro, even the mighty Hrithik Roshan could not get it the footfalls required to guarantee success.Published in Dawn, Sunday Magazine, September 4th, 2016\n", "author": "Surekha Kadapa-Bose", "title": "ForeignFront: Distorting history for the sake of masala in Hindi films"}}

Australia lost their world number one ranking in Tests due to the series defeat and burnished their reputation as home-track bullies after their batsmen again proved hapless against spin bowling on turning wickets. With a huge challenge in the subcontinent looming against India in less than six months, Sutherland said probing questions were being asked of the national set-up. \u201cAre some of the fundamental things that we are doing to prepare our players to perform well and be highly competitive in sub-continental conditions passing the test?\u201d Sutherland said in comments published by Fairfax Media. \u201cI think that\u2019s where the review gets a little bit more meaty and challenging and more fundamental, going right down into questioning our high performance systems as well.\u201d Sutherland\u2019s comments come days after former Australia batsman Matthew Hayden slammed the high performance unit for having too much power over the team and selections. Hayden claimed head coach and selector Darren Lehmann and the high performance unit headed by former rugby international Pat Howard were undermining the players\u2019 ability to build a strong culture. \u201cThe players have got to actually wrestle back some of their own power from within rather than listening to your physios, your strength and conditioning coaches, your high performance manager and even your coach for that matter and actually dig in as a group and build the culture,\u201d Hayden, a former team-mate of Lehmann, fumed on local radio station Triple M. Australia hired Sri Lanka spin great Muttiah Muralitharan as a coaching consultant to help their batsmen prepare for the South Asian nation\u2019s pitches but many appeared clueless when facing veteran left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, who took 28 wickets and was named man-of-the-series.

The committee, chaired by Saleem Mandviwalla, noted that the circular debt was around Rs480 billion in five years which was cleared in June 2013. However, since then Rs321bn has accumulated in this head. The committee questioned Ministry of Water and Power\u2019s Additional Secretaries Zargham Eshaq Khan and Omar Rasool if the government was giving any subsidy on electricity. The two officials replied in negative. PTI\u2019s Mohsin Aziz pointed out that crude oil was at around $120 per barrel in 2013 and electricity rates were Rs7 per unit. \u201cOil is around $40 per barrel now and the power rate is Rs12 per unit. What is the reason for the resurgence of circular debt?\u201d Senator Aziz questioned. The committee was informed by the officials that an MoU has been signed between the government and Independent Power Producers (IPPs) to convert their fuel base from oil to coal. Three IPPs have been granted tariff by Nepra and are establishing infrastructure in this regard, the officials informed. However, the Senate body termed the MoU one sided to favour the IPPs only. The committee decided to hold a separate meeting over the subject and directed the ministry of water and power to bring production data of Musharraf era, PPP government and the current figures. Earlier, the committee discussed various foreign funded projects in agriculture and livestock sectors. Conflicting figures were received from relevant officials of Sindh and Balochistan provinces as well as Economic Affair Division (EAD) officials. Balochistan officials said they received Rs1.86 million from the division while the EAD officers said the entire Rs52m Japanese grant has been transferred to the province. The committee was informed that another Japanese grant of Rs45m for agriculture project in Sindh was lying with EAD as the Sindh government was not coming up with any project despite repeated reminders.

The report, which was released by the Washington-based Institute for Science and International Security, is based on information provided by several officials of governments involved in the negotiations. The group\u2019s president David Albright, a former UN weapons inspector and co-author of the report, declined to identify the officials. \u201cThe exemptions or loopholes are happening in secret, and it appears that they favour Iran,\u201d Albright said.Among the exemptions were two that allowed Iran to exceed the deal\u2019s limits on how much low-enriched uranium (LEU) it can keep in its nuclear facilities, the report said. LEU can be purified into highly enriched, weapons-grade uranium.The exemptions, the report said, were approved by the joint commission the deal created to oversee implementation of the accord. The commission is comprised of the United States and its negotiating partners \u2014 called the P5+1 \u2014 and Iran. One senior \u201cknowledgeable\u201d official was cited by the report as saying that if the joint commission had not acted to create these exemptions, some of Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities would not have been in compliance with the deal by Jan 16, the deadline for the beginning of the lifting of sanctions. The US administration has said that the world powers that negotiated the accord \u2014 the United States, Russia, China, Britain, France and Germany \u2014 made no secret arrangements. A White House official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the joint commission and its role were \u201cnot secret.\u201d He did not address the report\u2019s assertions of exemptions. Diplomats at the United Nations for the other P5+1 countries did not respond to Reuters\u2019 requests for comment on the report. Iranian officials were not immediately available for comment. The report\u2019s assertions are likely to anger critics of the nuclear deal. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has vowed to renegotiate the agreement if he\u2019s elected, while Democrat Hillary Clinton supports the accord. Albright said the exceptions risked setting precedents that Iran could use to seek additional waivers. Albright served as an inspector with the UN International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) team that investigated former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein\u2019s nuclear weapons programme. While Albright has neither endorsed nor denounced the overall agreement, he has expressed concern over what he considers potential flaws in the nuclear deal, including the expiration of key limitations on Iran\u2019s nuclear work in 10-15 years. The administration of President Barack Obama informed Congress of the exemptions on Jan. 16, said the report. Albright said the exemptions, which have not been made public, were detailed in confidential documents sent to Capitol Hill that day \u2014 after the exemptions had already been granted.The White House official said the administration had briefed Congress \u201cfrequently and comprehensively\u201d on the joint commission\u2019s work.Democratic Senator Robert Menendez, a leading critic of the Iran deal and a senior member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said in an email: \u201cI was not aware nor did I receive any briefing (on the exemptions).\u201d Republican Senator Bob Corker, the committee chairman and leader of the opposition in Congress to the nuclear deal, said the administration was \u201cwilling to accommodate Iran at every turn to implement a flawed agreement that granted Tehran billions in sanction relief and paved the way for the industrialisation of its nuclear programme.\u201d Corker, however, did not address the exemptions.As part of the concessions that allowed Iran to exceed uranium limits, the joint commission agreed to exempt unknown quantities of 3.5 per cent LEU contained in liquid, solid and sludge wastes stored at Iranian nuclear facilities, according to the report. The agreement restricts Iran to stockpiling only 300 kg of 3.5 per cent LEU.Published in Dawn, September 2nd, 2016\n", "author": "Reuters", "title": "US, others agreed upon \u2018secret\u2019 exemptions for Iran after N-deal"}}
{"1281462": {"date": "September 02, 2016", "article": "RIO DE JANEIRO: He is a president few Brazilians want, replacing a leader hardly any saw fit to stay.The senate\u2019s dismissal on Wednesday of Dilma Rousseff, the least popular president since Brazil returned to democracy three decades ago, handed power to a politician almost as unpopular, vice president Michel Temer.For much of his five decades in politics, the softly-spoken Temer has worked in the shadows, building alliances within his fragmented Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) and rising to become one of the leading dealmakers in Brazil\u2019s Congress.His discrete manner and impeccable dress earned him the nickname among political allies and enemies alike of \u201cThe Butler\u201d. Now the 75-year-old, who will serve out the presidential term through 2018, must win the confidence of a nation bitterly divided by the impeachment process and frustrated by the worst recession in decades.He must also overcome Brazilians\u2019 disillusionment with the political class, which many see him embodying, after a sweeping corruption scandal at the state oil company Petrobras that has ensnared his party.\u201cIt is time to reunite the country and put national interests above those of groups,\u201d Temer said in his first televised address as president. \u201cI repeat my commitment to democratically dialogue with all sectors of Brazilian society.\u201d Temer has already shown he will steer Latin America\u2019s largest nation to the centre-right since he took over as interim president when Rousseff was suspended in May, unveiling plans to curb public spending and reform the generous pension system and welfare benefits.That agenda will make unity hard to achieve with many blue-collar voters already angry at the loss of hard-won economic gains achieved during 13 years of Workers Party rule and unemployment running at nearly 12 million, or just over 11 per cent.After Temer\u2019s swearing in on Wednesday, hundreds of youths took to the streets of Sao Paulo, smashing shop windows and hurling rocks at riot police, who responded with tear gas.\u201cThere is no single leader who can unify Brazil at this moment, certainly not Temer,\u201d said Sergio Praca, a political scientist at the Getulio Vargas Foundation, a leading Brazilian university. \u201cFor a portion of the population, whether fair or not, he is linked to the idea that there has been a \u2018coup\u2019. His challenge is not just pushing through reforms. His challenge is his political survival.\u201d Contrasting styles Rousseff, 68, was a gruff leader who minced no words with subordinates who made mistakes. Temer, who speaks in the rigidly formal Portuguese of a former constitutional law professor, could not be more different \u2014 from Rousseff or most of his countrymen.The son of Lebanese immigrants who arrived in Brazil in 1925, Temer was the youngest of eight children. He began his political career in the 1960s. He first served as an aide to Sao Paulo state\u2019s education secretary under Governor Adhemar de Barros \u2014 one of the politicians who inspired the Brazilian saying: \u201cHe steals, but he gets things done.\u201d But behind his old-fashioned demeanour and slicked-back gray locks, Temer is not entirely what one would expect from his staid public image. The father of five children is married to a former beauty pageant contestant 42 years his junior who has his name tattooed on her neck. He has also in recent years released a book of poetry titled Anonymous Intimacy. Its terse verse was penned on airplane napkins while he travelled from the capital Brasilia to his base in Sao Paulo. It includes praise for the female form and oblique allusions to Brazil\u2019s polarised politics.He has a low-key style but is not above splashes of vanity. Several years ago, he had a nose operation that corrected a deviated septum but also, he acknowledged, improved his looks.Seeking consensus Temer honed his craft over more than a decade in Brazil\u2019s bare-knuckle lower house of Congress, where he was an ally to both centrist President Fernando Henrique Cardoso and Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Rousseff\u2019s predecessor and mentor. He earned a reputation for staying above the fray.Those who have worked with him say he rarely raises his voice, does not curse and refrains from the dramatic theatrics his peers employ during debates \u2014 especially the antics seen from all sides during Rousseff\u2019s impeachment.For 15 years, he led the PMDB, an amorphous group with no consistent ideology, which holds more Congressional seats than any other. Since Brazil\u2019s return to democracy in 1985, the PMDB has mostly been content to let other parties hold the presidency while it positioned itself as the legislative power broker, winning pork barrel perks and control of ministries and their budgets in return for support in Congress.Now, though, the PMDB plans to field its own presidential candidate in 2018. Although Temer himself has said he will not run, his supporters say his long career working across the ideological spectrum makes him a strong transitional leader and will help set the PMDB up for whomever it casts as its candidate.But Rafael Cortez, a political analyst at Tendencias, a Sao Paulo consulting firm, said Temer\u2019s background and cordial manner could in fact be a liability. \u201cThe economic and political crises we are facing will require confrontation with both opposition and allies alike to push through reforms,\u201d Cortez said. \u201cThe success of a Temer presidency will depend on his willingness to be confrontational.\u201d Because Temer comes from the old, elite political class, Cortez said, he does not satiate the public\u2019s deep appetite for political renewal. \u201cFor that reason, the urgency underlying his presidency is to at least deliver on economic growth. If he achieves only that, not only does the PMDB stand a better chance in the 2018 elections, but it is not unreasonable to assume that Temer himself could make a run.\u201d\u2014ReutersPublished in Dawn, September 2nd, 2016\n", "author": "Brad Brooks", "title": "Brazil\u2019s new leader a consensus-builder who must prepare for a fight"}}
