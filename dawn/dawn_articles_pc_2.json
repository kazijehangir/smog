They broke Sri Lanka\u2019s record tally of 443 against Netherlands in 2006.     Opener Alex Hales overcame his dismal run in the Test series, scoring a scintillating 171 off 122 deliveries to set up the mammoth score. The ever-reliable Joe Root figured in a 248-run second wicket partnership with Hales. Wicketkeeper Jos Buttler and Eoin Morgan ensured that their side posted a virtually unassailable target, putting up 161 for the fourth wicket.   Pakistan were never really in the hunt in the face of such a formidable score. They made a valiant effort nevertheless, scoring at well above six runs an over during the first 20 overs. Sharjeel Khan led the chase with a sizzling 58. But the loss of wickets at regular intervals put them out of contention as five batsmen were back in the pavilion inside 20 overs.

Let us be realistic \u2014 nothing happened without a green signal from the relevant powers once General (later Field Marshal) Ayub Khan took the additional charge of defence minister in 1954.Decades later, there were many political parties and leaders who strongly opposed the grant of $30m to Samiul Haq\u2019s Madressah Haqqani.

It is a fact that originally it was the Western powers which in their own interests gave billions of dollars to various Pakistani organisations to sponsor, finance, train and arm jihadis and extremists to fight Soviet forces in Afghanistan, which they invaded in 1979. In fact, Muslim fundamentalists, Christian neocons and others joined hands to fight Soviet atheists.

{"1281382": {"date": "September 04, 2016", "article": "\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s official: superstar Hirthik Roshan\u2019s Mohenjo Daro has flopped in the domestic market! With a whopping alleged budget of Rs1 billion out of which Rs160 million was spent on production, it has barely earned Rs550 million from the Indian market in the two weeks that it has been running. Although the TV satellite rights and the international market will help the producers recover most of their investment, a substantial profit still isn\u2019t possible.Directed by Ashutosh Gowariker, Mohenjo Daro was touted as a historical film based on an era which so far hasn\u2019t been depicted in Hindi films. The Indus Valley civilization dates back to around 2500 BCE [more than 4,000 years old]. The archeological site of Mohenjo Daro is situated in Sindh, and was one the largest urbanised settlements of the Indus Valley civilization. It was discovered and excavated in the 1920s.Ashutosh said he carried out three years of research before writing the story. One doubts his statement. The costumes, the giant sets, props and even the language used in Mohenjo Daro represent a different era from what historians have reported after carrying out excavations at the site. Even the terracotta artefacts tell a different tale of the people who once lived there.In an episode of The Kapil Sharma Show, Ashutosh admitted that history was never his favourite subject in school. One wonders then what prompted the director to take on the subject. Previously, he has dabbled in history with Jodhaa Akbar (the Mughal period), Lagaan  (the Colonial era) and Khelein Hum Jee Jaan Sey (the 1930 Chittagong Uprising against the British Raj).\nMohenjo Daro is yet another gross misinterpretation of history to grace the silver screen\n\nBut Ashutosh isn\u2019t alone in depicting history as he perceives it. Most Indian film directors happily take on historical figures or incidents, labeling them as epics. While one can understand creative licenses, misrepresentation is an altogether different thing. In the 100-year-old Indian film industry there are many such examples. For some reason, film-makers from the days of Alam Ara (1931) are obsessed with historical subjects and happily alter facts to suit their film-making needs. The most-loved screen character is that of Mughal Emperor Akbar (A.D.1542-1605). While many films have been made on him and his son Emperor Jahangir, Mughal-i-Azam is supposed to be an all-time favourite. There was Taj Mahal followed by Anarkali; Taj Mahal: the epic love story; and of course Jodhaa Akbar. They are eye-candy with gigantic and opulent sets, majestic costumes (copied by fashion designers for wedding outfits) and good-looking female actors such as Madhubala, Bina Rai, Sonya Jehan (granddaughter of Madam Noor Jehan), and of course Aishwarya Rai-Bachchan. A melodious soundtrack further added to the glamour of these productions. Had it not been for the titles and set design, any of these films could have easily been mistaken for a neurotic love story of a typical Bollywood masala film.The other great emperor to be misrepresented on celluloid is Samrat Ashoka (268 to 232 BCE). Amrapali (starring Sunil Dutt, Vyjanthimala) and Asoka (Shah Rukh Khan, Kareen Kapoor) based on the emperor\u2019s life, conquests and later his adoption of Buddhism have taken such creative liberty with the subject matter that historians have every right to cry foul.In Bajirao Mastani by director Sanjay Leela Bhansali, the Kokanastha Brahmin community from Maharashtra to which Bajirao (A.D.1700-40) belonged, opposed the misrepresentation to such an extent that Bhansali had to carry a long disclaimer at the beginning of the film. Even the Rajputs of Rajasthan had objected to the presentation of Jodhaa in Jodhaa Akbar, which again led to the film having a disclaimer. Next in line was Ketan Mehta\u2019s Mangal Pandey \u2013 The Rising starring Aamir Khan. It was factually opposed by the descendents of freedom fighter Mangal Pandey (1827-57).In this context, both director Ashutosh Gowariker and Mohenjo Daro are lucky as no known descendants of the Indus Valley civilisation are around today to object to the gross misinterpretation of facts which run from form of governance to the reasons for Mohenjo Daro\u2019s eventual demise and even the city\u2019s name itself \u2013 Mohejo Daro (The Mound of the Dead) is a modern concoction, not the city\u2019s name when it actually existed! A slightly better presentation would have taken the film a long way, as this is the first production to be based on that time period.It\u2019s not as though all historical films made in Bollywood misrepresent history. There are some excellent ones too. We won\u2019t include Gandhi in the list as it was made by British director Richard Attenborough.But there are others. Shatranj ke Khilari (1977) by Satyjit Ray dealt with the decadence of royalty of Central North India, which was exploited by the British to annex the Kingdom of Awadh in 1856. The film represented that era aptly but didn\u2019t do too well. As it dealt with nawabs, Shatranj ke Khilari depicted regal ambience and majestic outfits. Opposed to this was Pather Panchali by the same director. It depicted poverty in the villages soon after the famous Bengal famine of 1943. Pather Panchali is a harsh but true and no-frills-attached film that won several national and international awards for its sheer artistic beauty, while depicting crippling poverty at that point in time\u200b.Director Deepa Mehta\u2019s Earth (1988) gave valuable insight into Partition and the havoc it created with interpersonal relationships. Mehta\u2019s second film, Water, was set in 1938 and dealt with the treatment meted out to widows in Varanasi. These were good films with sound research which made fictional figures appear quite realistic. There have been others as well such as Black Friday, Hey Ram, Parzania, Train to Pakistan, Firaaq, Bombay etc. Earlier, we also had Garam Hawa, Junoon, Sardar, Pinjar and others where the directors took an incident in history and stuck to as true a depiction as possible.If film-makers can\u2019t stay true to history, then they should at least use a different title for\u200b such films and not advertise them as \u2018historical\u2019. As in the case of Mohenjo Daro, even the mighty Hrithik Roshan could not get it the footfalls required to guarantee success.Published in Dawn, Sunday Magazine, September 4th, 2016\n", "author": "Surekha Kadapa-Bose", "title": "ForeignFront: Distorting history for the sake of masala in Hindi films"}}

More than 13,000 people were rescued in under a week at the end of May, and 8,300 more at the start of August.The Italian coastguard predicted that weather conditions would encourage the departure of further migrant boats on Tuesday.The vessels are often flimsy and overcrowded while some of the migrants set off in such poor health that even if the crossing is calm they cannot survive a day at sea.There are around a dozen vessels run by humanitarian groups that patrol the waters off the Libyan coast, but tensions in the zone have flared recently as rival factions battle to control migrant trafficking.This month an MSF ship taking part in migrant rescue operations came under attack from armed men who shot at the vessel before briefly climbing aboard, the medical charity said.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Over 6,500 migrants rescued off Libya"}}

{"1281112": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "KARACHI: Like any other event involving the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) these days, there was a lot of speculation about what might transpire at the oath-taking ceremony for the jailed mayor-elect of Karachi, Waseem Akhtar, and his deputy, Arshad Abdullah Vohra, on Tuesday. Some journalists suggested that Rangers might show up at the ceremony, but the idea was rejected soon after the event got under way. Others were betting on whether or not Mr Akhtar would raise the \u201cLong Live Pakistan\u201d slogan after taking the oath. The speculation stemmed from the fact that the MQM leader was to be produced before a district and sessions court at 11am, right when the oath-taking ceremony was to commence. Within a few minutes, reports came in that the district and sessions judge (South), Imdad Khoso, had withdrawn an earlier order on the basis of \u201cnot having clearance from the Sindh High Court to administer the oath-taking ceremony\u201d. As a result, the returning officer for the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), Samiuddin Siddiqui, requested the authorities to present Mr Akhtar at the event to take the oath. As soon as the order was passed, the empty seats began to fill up as one after the other diplomats, ambassadors and businessmen started to show up at the venue. The fact that Karachi would finally have a mayor after a gap of seven years was repeated far too often at the event. The deputy convener of the MQM\u2019s coordination committee, Dr Farooq Sattar, was the first from the party\u2019s senior cadre to walk in, followed by Khwaja Izhar-ul-Hassan. While Dr Sattar seemed to be avoiding the media after frequently appearing on television channels in the wake of the Aug 22 speech by Altaf Hussain, Khwaja Izhar seemed to be ready to give a speech to the press that asked him for a sound bite. However, his speech about \u201cpolitical participation and peace\u201d was interrupted midway when Mr Akhtar and Mr Vohra walked in. Amid a rather unenthusiastic applause from the audience, the mayor-elect took to the stage while waving to the people, first towards actor Behroz Sabzwari and then Dr Sattar who was sitting with some diplomats. Conspicuous by his absence from the audience was Governor Ishratul Ibad Khan, amid reports that the MQM is again trying to have him replaced. The brief silence that followed was broken by the host, who called Samiuddin Siddiqui to formally begin the proceedings which were already late by more than 90 minutes. Both Mr Akhtar and Mr Vohra then took their oaths, by repeating the words uttered by Mr Siddiqui and occasionally correcting him. The former administrator of Karachi, Laiq Ahmed, was then requested to hand over the \u201ckeys\u201d of the city to the elected mayor. Just as this was happening, MQM supporters raised the party slogan, chanting \u201cZinda Hai Mohajir Zinda Hai (Mohajirs are alive)\u201d and Jiye Muttahida (Long Live Muttahida)\u201d. Just then, a few people at the back raised the Bhutto slogan and within minutes a shouting match between pro-Muttahida and pro-PPP workers began. Mr Akhtar raised the slogans of the two parties, adding \u201cJiye Imran Khan\u201d, to make everyone happy. He then asked whether he could continue with his speech. Though that did not happen, as the group of PPP workers continued chanting their slogans, Mr Akhtar continued by thanking all the contesting political parties. He followed this up by thanking the Sindh government and Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, adding that Karachi needed an energetic and dynamic leader like Mr Shah to resolve the pending issues of \u201cthe city which was never treated right\u201d. Thanking the Supreme Court, he said it had taken nine long months before he finally could take the oath of his office. In a special mention of the PPP chairperson and co-chairperson, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari, Mr Akhtar added that they would all have to work together. Switching to English to address the business leaders of the city, he said that \u201cfalse but bailable charges\u201d had been filed against him, for which he had submitted a bail application in the court. What was absent from his speech was any mention of MQM founder Altaf Hussain. Once the ceremony was over, a relaxed Dr Sattar said the past nine months had been \u201ca painstaking and nerve-wrecking process\u201d for the party. He said: \u201cI\u2019m glad that we have a mayor now. But we need to have participatory politics rather than an isolated one. I\u2019m glad that [Mr] Akhtar mentioned all the political parties in his speech as we\u2019d like the participation of all political parties to make changes in Karachi.\u201d He said the mayor would first need to \u201cseek a parole, from where we\u2019ll take things forward\u201d. In the end, Mr Akhtar joined Dr Sattar on stage to answer queries from media personnel. Without mentioning the party chief, the mayor said that they would \u201cprotect Pakistan\u201d.Published in Dawn, August 31st, 2016\n", "author": "Saher Baloch", "title": "Akhtar takes mayor\u2019s oath, doesn\u2019t mention Altaf"}}

Yet it is premature to write off Altaf Hussain whose name has been synonymous with the very existence of the MQM. From his base in London, he still maintains contact with his supporters in Pakistan and across the world.  Altaf Hussain may have been wounded but he has certainly survived any detonating of the \u2018suicide vest\u2019 as others describe it. It appears obvious that what happened on Aug 22 was part of an organised plan that boomeranged. The party leadership in Pakistan may have dissociated itself from him and removed his name from the party constitution as the supreme leader whose decision could not be challenged. But it is extremely difficult to destroy the cult that has been built around his personality for the past three decadesOne fully empathises with Farooq Sattar who is walking a tightrope. Unsurprisingly, he dare not make a complete rupture and denounce his former leader publicly for his act of treason, for fear of breaking unity among the Muttahida leadership in Pakistan. There is also a fear of backlash from the militant wing that is directly controlled from London and that still pledges loyalty to the supreme leader, though it has been crippled by the ongoing operation. Examine: Confronting MQM\u2019s pastInterestingly, Altaf Hussain too has kept silent over the internal party revolt that claims to have stripped him of his undisputed authority reinforcing suspicion about a mutually agreed separation short of a divorce. It is, indeed, surprising that the entire Pakistani leadership overnight turned against their supreme leader whom they had defended even against the charges of an Indian connection. So what is the deal?   \nAltaf Hussain may have been wounded but he has certainly survived any detonating of the \u2018suicide vest\u2019.\n\nMany believe that while the party organisation in Pakistan would be allowed to operate independently, the London office would continue to control the overseas branches. They would maintain an aggressive stance to internationalise the issue of the alleged extra-judicial killing of MQM workers and their enforced disappearances. Altaf Hussain\u2019s latest harangue through telephonic addresses to MQM workers in America and South Africa lends credence to these theories.  This arrangement was, perhaps, necessary to ensure the success of the party\u2019s candidate for city mayor in the elections held a few days later. Waseem Akhtar, who was nominated with the approval of Altaf Hussain months ago, swept the polls easily with not a single MQM vote wasted. Any reaction from London against the decision of the Pakistan-based committee would have divided the party which could have caused it to lose control of the city government. By separating the Karachi and London committees, the MQM has apparently escaped the possibility of being banned. Almost all the major political parties are opposed to any move that could lead to the disintegration of the party into splinters thus strengthening militancy. For sure, the ongoing Rangers operation in Karachi has crippled the party\u2019s militant wing and contained its capacity to bring the city to a halt as it did frequently in the past. But the party is still deeply entrenched in the city and its vote bank has remained intact as demonstrated in the local government polls and various by-elections. The creation of the Pak Sarzameen Party (PSP) led by Mustafa Kamal may have made some dents in the MQM but it has failed to make much of an impact on the city\u2019s politics largely because of the perception of it being sponsored by the security establishment as part of a plan to re-engineer Karachi\u2019s politics. The latest crisis in the MQM may result in PSP support for some more defectors, but there is little possibility of it making any inroads into the hard-core Urdu-speaking vote bank. Such political manipulations by the security agencies have failed in the past too. In fact, the Rangers\u2019 revenge action following Aug 22 has played into Altaf Hussain\u2019s politics of victimhood so cleverly exploited by him in the past.

Mr Dar said the OECD model is much better than a simple bilateral \narrangement seeking information about tax matters.The cabinet also approved the initialled draft of the revised convention between Pakistan and the Swiss Confederation for the avoidance of double taxation with respect to taxes on Income.Elaborating, the minister said this process was initiated in 2014 and a two-member Pakistani delegation had held successful negotiatio{"1281152": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "NEW YORK: Eugenie Bouchard wrung her hands at her post-match news conference.

It represented the latest early loss for a 22-year-old Canadian who reached three Grand Slam semifinals two years ago \u2014 and none since.  In other first-round action on Day 2 at the year's last Grand Slam tournament, Serena Williams started her bid for a record-breaking 23rd major title by showing zero signs of trouble from a right shoulder she's said was sore, hitting 12 aces in a 6-3, 6-3 victory over Ekaterina Makarova.

Three seeded women departed, including former No. 1 and 2008 French Open champion Ana Ivanovic.    When she was at her peak, and a seeded player, an early major loss by Bouchard was rather newsworthy.

Let us be realistic \u2014 nothing happened without a green signal from the relevant powers once General (later Field Marshal) Ayub Khan took the additional charge of defence minister in 1954.Decades later, there were many political parties and leaders who strongly opposed the grant of $30m to Samiul Haq\u2019s Madressah Haqqani. Similarly, the official stand vis-a-vis Abdul Aziz Ghazi has been mysterious. And who knows if there is still somebody in the background arranging colossal doles to Maulana Samiul Haq or if some big portion of this amount is meant for some other entity. Only a future audit, if any, of the Haqqani Madressah will reveal the real facts.Another side of the affair, ignored by Mr Bennett-Jones, needs to be highlighted. It is a fact that originally it was the Western powers which in their own interests gave billions of dollars to various Pakistani organisations to sponsor, finance, train and arm jihadis and extremists to fight Soviet forces in Afghanistan, which they invaded in 1979. In fact, Muslim fundamentalists, Christian neocons and others joined hands to fight Soviet atheists. Now during the post-Soviet era every group claims and insists that they are the real believers in God and others need to be eliminated. Hence they are after each other\u2019s blood!It would be unrealistic indeed to ignore the role of some Western and Middle Eastern countries in creating this modern-day evil!Nasser {"1281112": {"date": "August 31, 2016", "article": "KARACHI: Like any other event involving the Muttahida Qaumi Movement (MQM) these days, there was a lot of speculation about what might transpire at the oath-taking ceremony for the jailed mayor-elect of Karachi, Waseem Akhtar, and his deputy, Arshad Abdullah Vohra, on Tuesday. Some journalists suggested that Rangers might show up at the ceremony, but the idea was rejected soon after the event got under way. Others were betting on whether or not Mr Akhtar would raise the \u201cLong Live Pakistan\u201d slogan after taking the oath. The speculation stemmed from the fact that the MQM leader was to be produced before a district and sessions court at 11am, right when the oath-taking ceremony was to commence. Within a few minutes, reports came in that the district and sessions judge (South), Imdad Khoso, had withdrawn an earlier order on the basis of \u201cnot having clearance from the Sindh High Court to administer the oath-taking ceremony\u201d. As a result, the returning officer for the Karachi Metropolitan Corporation (KMC), Samiuddin Siddiqui, requested the authorities to present Mr Akhtar at the event to take the oath. As soon as the order was passed, the empty seats began to fill up as one after the other diplomats, ambassadors and businessmen started to show up at the venue. The fact that Karachi would finally have a mayor after a gap of seven years was repeated far too often at the event. The deputy convener of the MQM\u2019s coordination committee, Dr Farooq Sattar, was the first from the party\u2019s senior cadre to walk in, followed by Khwaja Izhar-ul-Hassan. While Dr Sattar seemed to be avoiding the media after frequently appearing on television channels in the wake of the Aug 22 speech by Altaf Hussain, Khwaja Izhar seemed to be ready to give a speech to the press that asked him for a sound bite. However, his speech about \u201cpolitical participation and peace\u201d was interrupted midway when Mr Akhtar and Mr Vohra walked in. Amid a rather unenthusiastic applause from the audience, the mayor-elect took to the stage while waving to the people, first towards actor Behroz Sabzwari and then Dr Sattar who was sitting with some diplomats. Conspicuous by his absence from the audience was Governor Ishratul Ibad Khan, amid reports that the MQM is again trying to have him replaced. The brief silence that followed was broken by the host, who called Samiuddin Siddiqui to formally begin the proceedings which were already late by more than 90 minutes. Both Mr Akhtar and Mr Vohra then took their oaths, by repeating the words uttered by Mr Siddiqui and occasionally correcting him. The former administrator of Karachi, Laiq Ahmed, was then requested to hand over the \u201ckeys\u201d of the city to the elected mayor. Just as this was happening, MQM supporters raised the party slogan, chanting \u201cZinda Hai Mohajir Zinda Hai (Mohajirs are alive)\u201d and Jiye Muttahida (Long Live Muttahida)\u201d. Just then, a few people at the back raised the Bhutto slogan and within minutes a shouting match between pro-Muttahida and pro-PPP workers began. Mr Akhtar raised the slogans of the two parties, adding \u201cJiye Imran Khan\u201d, to make everyone happy. He then asked whether he could continue with his speech. Though that did not happen, as the group of PPP workers continued chanting their slogans, Mr Akhtar continued by thanking all the contesting political parties. He followed this up by thanking the Sindh government and Chief Minister Syed Murad Ali Shah, adding that Karachi needed an energetic and dynamic leader like Mr Shah to resolve the pending issues of \u201cthe city which was never treated right\u201d. Thanking the Supreme Court, he said it had taken nine long months before he finally could take the oath of his office. In a special mention of the PPP chairperson and co-chairperson, Bilawal Bhutto-Zardari and Asif Ali Zardari, Mr Akhtar added that they would all have to work together. Switching to English to address the business leaders of the city, he said that \u201cfalse b
