The reference was filed after Imran declared Gulalai a defector and wrote to the NA speaker and the CEC, seeking commencement of the process for her disqualification.During the hearing, Advocate Sikander Mohmand stated before the ECP that Gulalai had gained membership to the NA not by contesting elections but after being nominated by Imran for a reserved seat. The lawyer added that Gulalai had violated party laws by abstaining from voting for PTI\u2019s designated candidate in the elections for the office of prime minister, which were held after former prime minister Nawaz Sharif was disqualified by the Supreme Court.The lawyer told the bench that on July 29 \u2500 a day after Nawaz was ousted \u2500 a PTI session was held at Imran's Bani Gala residence where it was decided that the party would field Sheikh Rasheed as its candidate for the prime minister's office. Advocate Sikander said that Gulalai was present during the session. Stating that Imran had also notified all party members of the decision to support Rasheed, the lawyer presented before the ECP an affidavit signed by PTI's chief whip in the National Assembly Shireen Mazari attesting to the same. In a previous hearing of the case, Gulalai had said that she had not participated in the voting process for the prime minister in the National Assembly due to illness.Refuting Gulalai's statement, the lawyer presented before the ECP a record of television talk shows that the former PTI member had appeared on at the time of the NA session to speak about her decision to leave the PTI.On August 1, Gulalai had announced her exit from the party amid a flurry of scathing allegations against Imran Khan and other top party members.Gulalai made the announcement moments before the election of a new prime minister, citing \"ill-treatment\" of women in the party as the reason behind her decision. She had claimed that she had communicated her grievances to the party leadership but no action had been taken.Prior to her resignation Gulalai, who is a former PPP member, had been a staunch and vocal supporter of the PTI and Imran Khan, often featuring in prime time talkshows to defend party policies.\n", "author": "Muhammad Bilal", "title": "Gulalai violated PTI's laws, Imran's lawyer tells ECP"}}

{"1362845": {"date": "October 10, 2017", "article": "\n\nThe writer works in strategy and business development at Microsoft.\n\n\nTHE year 2017 has been a difficult one for Silicon Valley as the tech industry in the United States has repeatedly come under fire following blog posts, lawsuits and expos\u00e9s centred on sexual harassment and gender discrimination. While there is still a long way to go before we see equality of the sexes in the American tech industry, the year 2017 has been a step in the right direction. Unfortunately, many other countries around the world have not yet reached the same level of discourse around issues of diversity and inclusion in STEM, or science, technology, engineering, and math. A recent study, Engineers of jihad, exploring the connection between violent extremists and the STEM fields showed that a large majority of radical-minded Muslims have engineering backgrounds. The researchers\u2019 explanation was that individuals with extremist proclivities may be more inclined to pursue studies in engineering. The authors describe an \u2018engineering mindset\u2019 which favours right-wing ideology, hierarchy and order.Some have argued against this study, calling into question the samples and methodology used. In Pakistan, however, there is overwhelming anecdotal evidence for the existence of religious extremism in STEM. Famous examples include Afiya Siddiqui, an MIT-trained neuroscientist who was arrested on charges of her connections to Al Qaeda, 9/11 \u2018mastermind\u2019, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who studied mechanical engineering in the US and Hafiz Saeed, a founding member of Lashkar-e-Taiba, who was a faculty member of University of Engineering and Technology in Lahore. This pattern has become even more alarming in Pakistan\u2019s context with the newest militant group, Ansarul Sharia Pakistan (ASP) which is claimed to have carried out several terrorist attacks in Karachi. Some members of the ASP belonged to the physics department of Karachi University and the NED University of Engineering and Technology. \nDo religious extremists opt for STEM education?\nFurther exploration is needed to determine whether there is a significant correlation specifically between STEM fields in Pakistan and violent extremists, and the underlying mechanisms of this relationship. While it is indeed possible that the mindset that leads individuals to gravitate towards these disciplines also makes them more likely to espouse extreme religious beliefs, STEM departments at universities and colleges have also fostered a culture of radicalisation. This is not just significant for effective counterterrorism policy. Science and technology play a central role in the development and progress of any nation. Sadly, the prevalence of extremist ideology has had a damning effect on the STEM fields in Pakistan. There is a common perception that STEM departments in universities are heavily dominated by bearded men and have fallen victim to increasing religiosity. This trend extends to workplaces in STEM fields. Pervez Hoodbhoy, a physicist and professor, has been an outspoken critic of the impact of \u2018Islamisation\u2019 on the state of science and technology in Pakistan. In articles and interviews, he has brought attention to the increasingly anti-science culture in Pakistan which is closely tied to the infiltration of religion in the teaching of STEM subjects. He cites examples, such as textbooks that decry the theory of evolution. The increasing religiosity and our inability to separate religion from science has had great bearings on the quality of education in STEM and the future of the field in Pakistan. The intolerant and extremist culture in the field is also a deterrent against diversity and inclusion. Women are unwelcome in a field dominated by ultra-religious men. My career in the technology sector in Pakistan has led me to encounter men who inform women in the workplace that religion forbids them from going outside the home unless it is out of absolute necessity; men who harass women who are friendly with male colleagues; and men who refuse to look directly at female colleagues as they are \u2018na-mehram\u2019. This intolerance extends to all kinds of diversity \u2014 the most tragic example being that of Dr Abdus Salam, a Nobel prize winning Pakistani physicist who was rejected by our country for belonging to the Ahmadi community. In this atmosphere, the brightest and best students of Pakistan are no longer gravitating towards STEM subjects as they are now seen as backwards. Those who are, strive to leave Pakistan resulting in a serious brain-drain in the STEM fields. A friend who recently completed her PhD from a top university in the US lamented that she couldn\u2019t come back to a country where she wouldn\u2019t even be able to teach the theory of evolution.While the debate in Silicon Valley rages around gender equality, it is time that Pakistan seriously started considering the sorry state of the STEM fields. We need to modernise the field, including revising textbooks, attracting better faculty, enacting legislation around diversity and inclusion and reintroducing Pakistani youth to heroes such as Dr Abdus Salam.The writer works in strategy and business development at Microsoft.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "Anum Malkani", "title": "STEM crisis"}}

{"1362825": {"date": "October 10, 2017", "article": "LAHORE: \u2018F\u2019 is lying in pain in one of Mayo Hospital\u2019s wards. A patient of breast cancer, she has been admitted for surgery, but her lump is the size of a football now, and chances of her winning the battle seem improbable. \u201cShe only came here because the lump had begun to tear through the skin, and the infection had begun to seep. It was stinking,\u201d says a doctor. The situation in Pakistan \u2013 which has the highest rates of breast cancer in Asia \u2013 is dire. Data collected by Pink Ribbon, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO) dealing with the issue, shows that cases of breast cancer rise by around 12 to 13 per cent every year and 40,000 women die of this disease. Also, one out of every nine women is at the risk of breast cancer, which translates to a startling 9.8 million women. In total, 90,000 new cases are reported every year. But Dr Asghar Naqi, professor of surgery at the King Edwards Medical University, says the reasons for such high death toll and number of cases can be addressed. \u201cThe first problem is ignorance,\u201d he said. \u201cThe very first presentation \u2013 appearance in front of doctor -- of 90pc of breast cancer cases happen when the disease has reached stage 3.\u201d \u201cIn other countries too, there are delays but usually those delays are in system such as diagnosis or test results. In Pakistan, the patient does not see a doctor only because anything to do with the breast is a taboo. Then if they do go for treatment, many of them look for an easy way out,\u201d he added. The second problem is pirs or faith healers. \u2018F\u2019, for example, has tried many treatments, including faith healing (pirs) and homeopathy. And of course, there have been no results. Forty-year-old Kausar, who discovered a lump a year ago, was actively discouraged by her family from visiting the doctor. Instead she was taken to a woman faith healer who whiled away time on the pretext of doing \u2018spiritual magic\u2019 to get rid of the lump. As its size grew and Kausar realised the \u2018magic\u2019 wasn\u2019t working, she went to a doctor only to find out the cancer had grown too big. Ultimately, a breast had to be removed. The most common discovery happens by accident. \u201cUsually when most women notice a lump, it is around 3cm or a little more. But this size usually indicates stage 2 cancer,\u201d says Dr Naqi. This points at basic lack of awareness among women. Dr Naqi points out that unfortunately since pain is not a symptom the lump is not given importance. \u201cIn other parts of the world, mammography has come up as the most successful method to prevent breast cancer. In fact, prevention is the best cure. We must be able to detect a lump when it is just the size of a seed.\u201d The third problem, he says, is that many people do not have access to a proper healthcare centre. A majority of families cannot reach hospitals because of lack of finances or there aren\u2019t any such facilities, or sometimes because a female doctor is preferred and is not available. The doctor may ask the patient to get a needle biopsy done in order to check whether the lump is actually cancer or not. As a rule though, all lumps must be treated as malignant, not benign, Dr Naqi added. A patient told her gynaecologist about with a lump, who began treating it for other diseases. Eventually, the patient succumbed to breast cancer. Her family did not know about the lump until much later. Meanwhile, Pink Ribbon representatives say they are trying to raise funds for the construction of a dedicated breast cancer hospital in Lahore. \u201cIt will provide international standard facilities for diagnosis and treatment,\u201d said a representative. \u201cWe aim for this to be free.\u201d For most people, breast cancer treatment is expensive. Almost every stage, especially chemotherapy, costs so much money that the patient may never receive treatment. With the exception of a couple, most government hospitals do not have mammography machines. Yet, the best possible alternative, not just for NGOs, but also for the government\u2019s health department, is awareness of the disease in both cities and remote areas as being integral to saving lives of thousands of women.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "Xari Jalil", "title": "\u201890pc of breast cancer cases reported to doctors at stage 3\u2019"}}

The highly unusual exchange came seemingly out of nowhere on a rainy Sunday morning that Trump began in the White House before skies cleared and he headed to a nearby golf course.Corker, a respected moderate who once supported Trump, has emerged in recent months as one of the president\u2019s most outspoken Republican critics.He recently said that only the presence of the generals in Trump\u2019s inner circle had kept the White House from descending into \u201cchaos\u201d. Trump made no mention of that remark in his volley of tweets, instead attacking Corker for his decision to return to private life, saying that the Tennessee Republican bore heavy responsibility for what Trump considers the deeply flawed nuclear deal with Iran.\u201cSenator Bob Corker \u2018begged\u2019 me to endorse him for re-election in Tennessee. I said \u2018NO\u2019 and he dropped out (said he could not win without my endorsement),\u201d Trump wrote in a series of tweets.\u201cHe also wanted to be Secretary of State, I said \u2018NO THANKS.\u2019 He is also largely responsible for the horrendous Iran Deal!\u201d Trump called Corker a \u201cnegative voice\u201d who would \u201cstand in the way of our great agenda\u201d.  Corker for his part disputed the account, telling the New York Times that President Trump had urged him to run again and promised to endorse him if he did.\u201cI don\u2019t know why the president tweets out things that are not true,\u201d he said.The generals and \u2018chaos\u2019: Trump\u2019s tweet storm was not particularly unusual \u2014 he has rarely been one to calmly endure criticism \u2014 but Corker\u2019s blunt rebuttal was strikingly rare, coming from a fellow Republican in such a prominent position.The senator, perhaps feeling liberated by his decision not to seek re-election, tweeted: \u201cIt\u2019s a shame the White House has become an adult day care centre. Someone obviously missed their shift this morning,\u201d hinting that presidential caretakers were not doing their job.Corker had supported Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. He reportedly was considered as a possible vice presidential running mate to Trump, and later as a potential secretary of state.But the relationship took a turn for the worse in August. After Tru\u00admp\u2019s much-criticised remarks about the violent protests in Charlot\u00adtesville, Virginia, Corker said the president had \u201cnot yet been able to demonstrate the stability, nor some of the competence, that he needs to demonstrate\u201d.Published in Dawn, October 10th, 2017\n", "author": "AFP", "title": "Trump could set off WWIII, fears top Republican"}}

She tried to run into the surrounding jungle, but was captured by a soldier.The home of the teenager was torched in the attack in Kawarbil village six weeks ago by Myanmar army soldiers, she said, and she and her sister fled with other villagers across the border to Bangladesh.But the threat of sexual violence for children like Adjida has not diminished since reaching the sprawling refugee camps near Bangladesh\u2019s Cox\u2019s Bazar \u2014 home to hundreds of thousands of newly arrived Rohingya who have fled violence in Myanmar.More than 800 incidents of gender-based violence have been reported by Rohingya refugees since the recent influx, said Unicef\u2019s head of child protection Jean Lieby. Over half of these cases are sexual assaults, according to the UN agency.Some 515,000 Rohingya have arrived in Bangladesh in an unrelenting movement of people that began after the Myanmar army responded to Rohingya militant attacks with a brutal crackdown.The UN has denounced the Myanmar military offensive as ethnic cleansing but Myanmar insists its forces are fighting \u201cterrorists\u201d who have killed civilians.About 60 per cent of the new arrivals are children. Adjida arrived with her 15-year-old sister Minara a month ago. The sole survivors of their family, they live by themselves in a tent made of bamboo and plastic sheeting in Kutupalong camp.They don\u2019t feel safe.\u201cOur parents and two older sisters were killed and they can\u2019t take care of us anymore. Here in the camp, we have already heard of other girls who were raped in the last days, that\u2019s why we try to stay in our tent most of the time,\u201d Minara said.Trauma\nThe girls agreed to speak to the Thomson Reuters Foundation in an empty classroom of one of the camp\u2019s school buildings, but asked for windows to be closed and that they not be identified by their full names.The girls covered their faces with their headscarves and asked for assurances no men would be allowed into the room.\u201cI\u2019m ashamed of what happened. I had many dreams for the future, but they are lost with my purity,\u201d said Minara, who was also raped as she tried to escape from her village.\u201cI don\u2019t have enough clothes to fully cover, but it\u2019s what I want to do now,\u201d she said, nervously fidgeting with the embroidered black dress she had borrowed from a neighbour.Aid agencies have set up safe spaces in Kutupalong camp \u2014 colourful rooms or outside areas \u2014 where women and children who are victims of sexual assault can find counselling and support.\u201cThey feel comfortable and understood here and it\u2019s often the first time they open up and talk about their trauma,\u201d said UNFPA spokeswoman Veronica Pedrosa.But there is not enough help for the overwhelming numbers who have arrived in such a short time.\u201cWe just had a month of unprecedented refugee influx and it\u2019s nothing like Bangladesh has seen before. Almost half a million people arrived,\u201d said Lieby of Unicef. \u201cWe are now working hard to scale-up and meet the needs of refugee children. We especially ... want to change the stigma that comes with rape.\u201d Stigma\nEven with counselling services available, many girls still opt not to report that they have been raped, said aid workers in the camp.\u201cIn an environment like this, girls are often scared of the stigma attached to sexual violence. They also fear their family\u2019s opinion,\u201d said Rebecca Duskin, a nurse focusing on sexual violence in Kutupalong.Working for the health charity Medical Teams International, she has come to the camp to set up a disease prevention clinic.\u201cThis is often the first sexual encounter for the victims and they need a safe place to turn to now,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have experienced violent rape in a conflict zone and often in public, which increases trauma.\u201d Kutupalong\u2019s new refugees have arrived exhausted, hungry and often with physical injuries such as machete or gunshot wounds.

There are no more guns here, but there are people who could rape us again.\u201d Her younger sister Adjida, sitting next to her, agrees.\u201cI thought I was going to die when the soldiers took us to the jungle.

{"1362725": {"date": "Updated October 10, 2017", "article": "Jails get quiet when prisoners hear an execution warrant has been issued. Like every other jail in Pakistan, Sahiwal Central Jail was full. Of course, by full, I mean holding twice as many prisoners than it was built for. If you put thousands of men in cages, it can get loud. I barely slept at night when I was a prisoner there for ten years. The sounds of men snoring, crying and sometimes screaming in their sleep will keep you awake.The exception was when we knew that one of us was heading to the gallows. We would get silence, but we would lose our sleep. They would quietly separate the prisoner with the execution warrant from the general population of the prison. We all knew then that his time had come.Even those of us who were not on death row would tense up. Held like animals in a pen, we would turn to the one thing that we could do: pray. We would collect in groups, praying to a higher power \u2013 because the power on the ground was not listening \u2013 to spare his life, for mercy to replace vengeance, for a miracle.We would know that the deed had been done when the prison guard, charged with counting the prisoners every morning, would be late. On normal days, he would turn up at 5:30 am. On an execution day, he would arrive by 8:00 am. That day, none of us would speak. The televisions and radio would be silent. \nJails in Pakistan are always clean because prisoners are in charge of upkeep. They do not have much to do to while away the time. So they clean. But sometimes, they also help with carrying out the execution. The prisoners helping out with the execution are responsible for removing the body, after it has remained suspended for 30 minutes. This is a requirement under Pakistan\u2019s Prisons Manual. They also clean the corpse, and hand it over to the family that waits outside the prison gate with a charpai and a set of clothes. The family is also told to arrange an ambulance at their own expense. Prisons have a graveyard where unclaimed bodies are buried. There are not that many graves there, though. Many of us have families. Demonised as we are by the rest of the world, there are still people who remember us as humans, not criminals. We do mean something to somebody. \nI was asked to witness an execution of one of my fellow inmates in 2006. Mami Pabal was a burly man, at least six feet tall with a booming voice. He had been at Sahiwal Central Jail for years and had befriended many of us. Even the prison officials liked his company. It was easy to forget that he had been accused of murder. He used to joke, \u201cThere  are a lot of crimes I should be in here for \u2013 but this murder is not one of them.\u201dWhen death unnecessarily came for him, he cried like a small child. He was escorted to the gallows. Half-carried would be more accurate. The Medical Officer, Magistrate, jail Superintendent, blacksmith, and two men from the victim\u2019s family were there. The jail staff who were present kept reminding the victim\u2019s family of the option to forgive Mami. The superintendent told him to recite the kalma. I don\u2019t think Mami heard him. He kept crying out that he had not done it, that he was innocent, that killing him would be murder, not justice. Even after they placed the hood over his face, Mami spent his last few breaths begging for his life. \nThere are barely any state executioners in Pakistan, despite having one of the world\u2019s largest death rows. That day, he was not available. So instead, the jail warden pulled the lever. Before he did, he bowed his head and said, \u201cI\u2019m helpless Mami. I\u2019m obligated to do this. If you can, please forgive me.\u201dYou never forget the sound of a body being dropped into the pit. The way the beam creaks is not loud enough to drown out the choking, the
